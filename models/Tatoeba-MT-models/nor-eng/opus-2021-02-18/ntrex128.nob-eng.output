Welsh members of Parliament do not wish to appear as Muppets
Members of the Welsh National Assembly, known today under the acronym AM (Assembly Memors), are not entirely satisfied with the proposal that their title can be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes as a result of plans to change the name of the parliament of the Welsh Parliament.
Representatives from all over the political spectrum fear that this could lead to ridicule.
A working party representative from Labour explained his group was concerned that “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp”.
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means "durste", and pwp means "dop".
A representative of the Wales Party, Plaid Cymru, said that the group in its entirety was ‘dissatisfied’ and that they have proposed alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh part of the Conservative Party said that his group was “open” for the name change, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very close to the word “Muppet”, which, in addition to being the name of some known dolls, is also a British slang word for “dug”.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced in a similar way as the letter U is pronounced in the English Yorkshire dialect, more like an "uh" sound.
Asembly Commission, who currently develops legislation to introduce the change of name, said: "Of course the members themselves have the last right of determination as to the name to which they are to be mentioned."
Government of Wales Act 2017 authorized the Welsh Parliament to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public hearing showing general support for the rejudging of the parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the representative title, the Commission supported the WMPs (Welsh Parlaiment Members), but the option MWP was most supported during the public hearing.
Apparently, the representatives are proposing other options, but getting all parties to come to an agreement could lead to a head-on for President Elin Jones, who, as planned, is going to submit a legislative draft for the change of name in the next couple of weeks.
The legislation on reform will include other changes in the functioning of the National Parliament, including rules for disqualification of representatives and the design of the Committee System.
Representatives have the last vote on what to call them when they debate the law.
Macedonians go to the polls to decide whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia may vote for the name of their country to be changed to ‘The Republic of Northern Macedonia’.
The referendum is held in an effort to solve a decades - long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a region named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim on their territory and has on several occasions opposed the country’s applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, an opposer of the referendum for the name change, has said that he will ignore the vote.
The public vote’s supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change in name is simply the price they have to pay to participate in the EU and NATO.
♪ The bells in St. Martin's silence ♪ ♪ The hearts of Harlem ♪
“The old people I talked to have told me that in the past there was a bar and a church on every corner, ” says Adams.
'Now neither is there.'
He said that the defection of the bars was understandable.
"People socialize with one another in other ways" these days, he says.
‘Bars are no longer the meeting places of the community, all of which visit regularly.’
As for the churches, he fears that the money from selling possessions will not last as long as the leaders believe, and sooner or later they will be back at baseline.
The churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings full of the kind of people who won't help the remaining neighborhoods.
‘Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘and will therefore only accelerate the day when these churches have to close their doors permanently, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.’
Both krik were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis — Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had lived nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's had a black congregation under priest John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of dealers on 125th Street — one of Harlem's main street deals — because they failed to hire or promote black workers.
A fire in 1939 damaged the building, and when Father Johnson’s parishioners made plans to rebuild the building, they purchased a carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's, proudly declared the convertible to be the church bells of the poor.
The expert who played the calillonet in July called it something else: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first convertible in the world played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved on to the largest carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martin's has never replaced him.
What has taken place at St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex interaction between architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom are hired by the church's legislature and others of the diocese.
The Council of Churches — the Head of the Church, made up of laymen — wrote in July to the diocese about its concern that the diocese would “try to impose the costs ” on the Council, although the Council of Churches had not been involved in the hiring of the architects or the contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of openness on the part of the diocese.
Sharks hurt 13-year-olds on lobster diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13 - year - old boy while diving after lobster in California on Saturday, the first day of lobster season, according to the government.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and that he and a group of others swam across to drag the boy out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was shouting out of enthusiasm for catching a lobster, but he came to realize that the boy was shouting, 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!'"
His entire collarbone was torn up, says Hammel, who discovered the damage when he reached the boy.
'I called for everyone to get out of the water, 'There is a shark in the water!'' added Hammel.
The boy was transported by air ambulance to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in critical condition.
The type of shark who carried out the attack is not known.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim suffered severe upper torso injuries.
The government closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not employed as dangerous.
Sainsbury's planning to make his move on Britain's beauty market.
Sainsbury's challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with warehouse-like make-up and beauty care shelves, manned by specially trained associates.
The expanded shelves are tested out in 11 stores around the country as part of a powerful entrance into Britain’s 2.8 million beauty - care market, which is experiencing steady growth as the sales figures for clothing and home items fall, and if the experiment proves successful, the concept will expand to several shops next year.
The investment in beauty care is the result of the supermarket’s attempt to find a new use for the space previously used for TVs, microwave ovens and home items.
Sainsbury's said they're gonna double the number of beauty care products they're offering for 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. Paw, that the store jet has never sold before.
Existing product selections from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also have more space in marked brands, in the same way as in shops like Boots.
The supermarket chain also relives its Boutique make-up mark with mainly vegan products, as there is an increasing demand for this among younger customers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume dealer is going to test out sales tables in two Sainsbury's stores, one opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the other opens in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online trade and a new tendency to buy small amounts of food daily from local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to tempt customers to come.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that sales are going to look more and more like a department store, as the supermarket is fighting against the Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets after buying both chains two years ago, and according to them, this has increased food sales and made the purchases more profitable.
Supermarket's last attempt to upgrade the beauty care and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation was terminated after an argument over the distribution of income from the drugstores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the Sainsbury's sold their 281 store pharmacys to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain, for GBP 125 million three years ago.
According to them, Lloyds will participate in the plan by adding a sample of luxury skin care marks, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s trading director, said: “We have transformed the appearance and design of the beauty - care shelves to create more inviting surroundings for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained associates who are ready to give advice and help.
Our brand selection is designed to meet all needs, and the inviting surroundings and practical locations make us now a beauty - care competitor representing a new shopping experience.’
Peter Jones is a rage after Holly Willoughby withdraws from a deal worth GBP 11 million.
The Dragons' Den star Peter Jones is said to be furious after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11 million-dollar deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for your home and accessories badge, Truly.
Their company was earlier compared to the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop.
Willoughby (37), host of The Morning, announced on Instagram that she is leaving the company.
Holly Willoughby has pissed off Dragons' Den Star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle brand in the last second to focus on her own new gold-edge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was a rage at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where the golden girl of television admitted that her new appointments — worth up to GBP 1.5 million — mean that she no longer has time for their clothing and accessories brand, Truly.
The Society has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, and it was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of GBP 11 million.
While Willoughby (37) announced on Instagram that she will leave Truly, Jones left Britain on her way to one of her vacation homes.
One source said: "Truly was certainly Holly's number one priority.
It was a long - term investment that would give her financial security for the next few decades.
Everyone is shocked that she has chosen to resign.
No one could believe it when it happened last Tuesday — it was just before the launch.
Now there is a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters that is now ready for sale.’
Experts believe that the This Morning program leader, who is among Britain’s most popular stars, may cost the company several million pounds due to large investment in products such as cushions and lights, fashion and comfort clothing, as well as a potential delay in launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby the mother of three and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones (52) became chairman in March.
The two couples are going on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M/3S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host to the I'm A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We don't want to comment on his business affairs."
"And then we fell in love."
He made a joke about the criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment that some would consider "smallly presidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given away so much?
said Trump in his imitation of a news anchor.
Saying: I have not expended anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a new meeting, having even declared that their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major shit on the road to nuclear disarmament by North Korea.
But the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the world leaders of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not seen a “equivalent response” from the United States to its early disarmament efforts.
Instead, he noted that the United States still has sanctions designed to keep the pressure up.
Trump had a much more positive attitude when speaking before an audience of his constituents.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Many millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have produced positive results, such as stopping missiles, helping to release hostages and having the remains of U.S. officials sent home.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to act with presidential dignity, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd have about 200 people standing right here," said Trump pointing to the area right in front of him.
Indonesian earthquakes and tsunamis raze an island and kill hundreds
In the wake of the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-profits were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 % of Lombox residents had lost their homes, a national disaster was not declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be sent in.
‘Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it clear that they are not asking for international help, so it is quite challenging’, Sumbung explained.
Afraid the children will now assemble a team to travel to Palu but are not yet sure if foreign employees will be allowed to work in the country.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to contribute to the relief work.
Considering the constant effects of the earthquakes Indonesia suffers, the country is terribly ill - prepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
Ly to protect against tsunamis is built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight along other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a warning siren on Palu, although a warning had been issued, has probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under the best of circumstances, traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters add to the challenge of logistics.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made an upgrade of Indonesia's falling-down infrastructure a major point in his campaign, and has spent a lot of money on the road and rail.
But lack of funds has been a major problem for Joko’s administration, which will be reelected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from sustained sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have converted to a more conservative form of Islam.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought the streets with machetes, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look, Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge with a late equivalency in a fight against Cheisine.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from Premier League losses against Chelsea on Saturday by scoring for 89 minutes in the Stanford Bridge fight in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 100 feet from the Chelsea target while his team was 1-0 behind.
He moved the ball to his left foot before sending it to the longest corner.
The test was high above the box, as the ball plunged to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball hit a jumping Kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘I was just trying to get to that position and get the ball, and players like Shaq always send the ball forward as well as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible,’ said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
'I saw Kante come and touched the ball once, and I did not think too much of it, and I just kicked it on.'
Chelsea led by 1-0 at the break, after the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal for 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker sent a pass with his heel back to Mateo Kovacic, before he changed his direction near the midfield and sprinted into Liverpool's track half.
Kovacic made a quick handover in midfield.
He then fired a great breakthrough pass that led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran faster than the defense and drove the ball into the net in the longest corner with a left footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool plays Naples in the Champions League group game at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo, Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's playing Videoton in the European League of Football for men in London at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
Indonesia’s tsunami death rate at 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunamis has risen to 832, reported to the National Emergency Management Agency early Sunday.
It was reported that many were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the earthquake with a strike of 7.5 that hit the country on Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet [6 m], the agency’s spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho explained at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of materials from demolished buildings.
Police arrest a man (32) for murder after a woman is stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been initiated since the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds at 7:55 in Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man arrested, suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who have seen or heard anything about contacting them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan says: “We are at the very beginning of the investigation, but I will ask everyone who was in the area around John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious about contacting us.
We also ask all, especially taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on their car camera to contact them — they may have information vital to our investigation.’
A police spokesperson has confirmed that the deceased woman was resident in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the scene of the crime, asking questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have said that they are working to inform the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment but has been told that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The householders are now told that it will be several hours before they are allowed back in.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene of the crime.
She repeats, "It's so terrible" over and over again.
At 2: 00 p.m., two police cars were behind the roadblock, while a third car was parked just outside.
A number of police officers were outside the cordon, supervising the apartment complex.
Persons holding information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPollCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Stopers anonymously of 0800 555 111, referring to ‘log 247’ from 30 September.
The Parliament's statue of Cromwell is the last memorial drawn into the argument about "to rewrite history"
The removal of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious treasures carried out by his fanatical puritanists.
But the history team Comwell Society has described Jeremy Cricks publisher as “stupid” and“ an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, director of the Cromwell Society, says: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside the Westminster Palace would also become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be punished for the sins of his ancestor Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's fantastic portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century's opinions and is part of historiography of a man many still think deserves to be praised.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell becomes of many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, viewed as the defense of Parliament against outside pressures -- in his day, of course, it was talk of the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact representation is still the subject of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure representing one side of that conflict.
His achievements as Lord Proctor are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
Killer Pig Kills Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on is a market in southwest China, according to local news reports.
The man, mentioned only by the surname Yuan, was found dead and covered with blood from a ruptured artery near a binge on the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to put vaccines on pigs on a farm on May 30, 2005, in the city of Xining, the Qinghai province of China.
Apparently, he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the gate to a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the pigsty there was a big mistake with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that the 500 - pound [250 kg] pig had killed the man.
“ My cousin’s legs were bloody and mauled, ” explained his cousin, mentioned by the surname Wu, in a quote to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance footage showed that Yuan went into the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
While the police were gathering evidence from the crime scene, one of the market leaders explained that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
Apparently, Yuan's family and market management are negotiating compensation for the death.
Even if that happens, it's not the first time it's been recorded that a pig has attacked humans.
In 2016 a pig attacked a couple on a farm in Massachusetts, causing serious damage.
Ten years earlier, a Welsh farmer was pushed up against a tractor and attacked by a 300 kg pig until the farmer’s wife was able to drive the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News explained that pigs are not aggressive to the usual, but that the taste of blood may have a triggering effect.
He said, "They are only playing.
They like to bite, and they're very curious... they're not trying to hurt anyone.
You will not be able to do anything except give sufficient respect."
What's left of Hurricane Rosa will lead to heavy rain in the southwest of the United States.
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakened as it moves across the cooler sea on the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa will still bring floodwaters on her way through northern Mexico and southwest America in the next few days.
Rosa had a wind force of 135 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane at 05:00 on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, as Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin pushing tropical moisture north towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 cm of rainfall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction between tropical humidity and the approaching trawl will result in widespread heavy rains in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, 3 to 10 cm of rain will lead to dangerous floods, liquid debris, and rapid and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will result in rainfall rates of up to 5–7 cm/hour in some areas, especially areas south of Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 5-10 cm rain is expected in parts of the southwest country, especially over large sections of Arizona.
Floods with rapidly worsening conditions are possible because of the scattered tropical rains.
It is very unwise to move around the desert on foot as long as there is a risk of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rain can cause torrent valleys to become rippling rivers, and thunder will result in local gusts of wind that may contain dust and sand.
The approaching step will result in local heavy rain showers for parts of the coast along Southern California.
A total rain drop of more than 1.3 cm is possible, which can lead to liquid debris and rapid, as well as slippery road tracks.
This will be the area's first rainfall of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before the rain spreads later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the corner states on Tuesday and continue all Wednesday.
October may cause some intense temperature changes across the United States as the Arctic grows colder but the Tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this results in drastic changes in temperature over shorter distances.
We'll see a clear example of severe temperature differences throughout central America on Sunday.
There will be almost 11-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
During the next couple of days, persistent summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large sections of central and east America are likely to have a hot start on October, with degrees high in the 20s from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast of the United States.
New York City can reach 26.5 degrees on Tuesday — this would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate report indicates that the eastern United States is most likely to have higher temperatures than usual throughout the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million viewers, distributed on six networks, saw Thursday's stirring testimony from Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political feud continued, and broadcasters interrupted their regular broadcasts to announce Friday’s big surprise at the last second, when it was announced that the senator of Arizona, Jeff Flake, had arranged for the FBI to conduct a week - long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Court that she is 100 percent sure that a drunken Kavanaugh touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a junior high school party.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh insisted that he is 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
The transmission on Friday was probably seen by more than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported.
The company calculated the average ratings for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The ratings were not immediately available to other networks showing the consultation including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring office viewers.
To give you some perspective, this is ratings that correspond to the endgame of the American football championship or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose landlords have supported Kavanaugh’s appointment with great enthusiasm, led the network, with an average of 5.69 million for the whole day’s hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was number two with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CCNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still great after the hearing.
Flake was the main character of Friday's drama.
The moderate Republican's office made a statement that he was going to vote in Kavanaugh's favor. Friday morning he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to take the elevator to a meeting of the court committee while protesters screamed and shouted at him.
He stood with his eyes lowered for several minutes while he was being reviled, while the incident was being sent directly to CNN.
"I am standing right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think that he tells the truth to our land?"
He was told that you were in power when so many women were powerless.
Flake pointed out that his office made a statement and said as the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say on the matter at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all the hearings directly several hours later, when the court committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh’s nomination should be passed on to the entire Senate for reconciliation.
But Flake said he was only willing to do this if the FBI investigated the charges against the candidate by next week, which the Democratic minority has urged.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and then several other senators.
Flake's choice had a profound impact when it was clear that the Republicans didn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without this investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "political games" of Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, British prime minister Theresa May has accused opposers of her plan to leave the EU of running ‘political games’ with Britain’s future and undermining its interests.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, pressed side by side with her own on the front page of the paper, her former Secretary of State Boris Johnson has carried on her attack against her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit by saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should recover each other's tariffs was "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde Sims shooting: police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a man suspected of shooting and killing Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player for Louisiana State University.
Dyteon Simpson (20) has been arrested and charged with manslaughter, according to Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS partner WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bail is set at USD 350,000, according to The Advocate.
The medical examiner of East Baton Rouge Parish published a preliminary report on Friday, the cause of death being indicated as a gunshot wound to the head and throat.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police task force for the extraction of refugees, the state police laboratory, the Southern University police and the locals for contributions to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU's sports leader Joe Alleva thanked the area's police force for their "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter forward player grew up in Baton Rouge, and his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 return per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"This is what we fear at all times," said Wade.
Volcano sprays ashes over Mexico City
The ash splashing out of the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southernmost neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital city.
Centro Nacional de Prevención de Desastres, Mexico’s State Department of Emergency Prevention, warned the people of Mexico on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the activity rose in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The agency monitored several cases of rumbling and shaking.
Photos on social media showed a thin layer of ash covering windshields on cars in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have detected increased activity from the volcano, located 72 km southeast of the capital after a 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after Protestants for independence clashed with the police, while thousands participated in competing demon stations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote on breakaway.
A group of masked separatists were held back by the riot police and bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, which caused dark dust clouds in streets commonly filled with tourists.
Squirrels also broke out later in the day, when police used batons to limit fights.
For several hours, independent protesters shouted, "Never forget, never forgive," face to face with Unionist protesters who shouted, "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received during protest, according to the local press.
Tension is still high in the liberation - oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatistic Catalans.
The vote showed an overwhelming majority for separation, but there was a poor turnout because the vote was boycotted by the majority who opposed liberation.
According to the Catalonian government, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent confrontations last year, after the police tried to stop the vote at election posts across the region.
Liberation groups camped in the streets night until Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
Nevertheless, the demonstration was abstention but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes (68), an electrician who took part in the separatist proscue test with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s independence.
“ Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck, ” he said.
Despite a narrow but decisive victory in regional elections last December, parties supporting Catalonian independence have had difficulty holding up the pressure this year, as many of their bitter - known leaders have traveled in self - imposed exile or are in custody awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent Declaration of Independence.
Joan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who used his phone to film the protest to support the police, said that the conflict is stirred by politicians on both sides.
‘The situation is getting more tense,’ he explained.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been imprisoned pending a trial since late last year, announced that he will be running for office in the European Parliament next year.
"Pressing a candidate for the European election is the best I can do to condemn the oppression and regression of democratic values we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car was driven into a wall of a house
Three men of 33, 34, and 39 years of age have been arrested after a car was driven several times into the wall of a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Bimmermings said that the incident had caused damage to the gate and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been fired on the car at some point.
Menga's attack leads to Livingston's 1-0 victory against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston ensured victory
Retired Livinston amazed the Rangers, who delivered Stevens Gerard's second loss after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
A good hit by Dolly Menga proved decisive, and Gary Holt’s side is now equal to Hibernian in second place.
Gerard’s side has still not won off track in the Premier League this season and is playing against leaders Hearts, eight points ahead of them, next Sunday.
Before this, the Rangers are playing a home game against Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston, on his side, has remained undefeated through six games in the division, and Chief Stern Holt has not yet lost a match since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is missing out on opportunities for his stupendous guests
Holt's team should have led long before they scored, when their direct approach caused countless problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through but missed the target, and Alan Lithgow could only pass the kick after slipping in to meet Craig Halkett header past the target.
The host let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could cause trouble for their guests at death ball.
And that is how the decisive goal came to be.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston found an opening — Declan Gallagher and Robinson working together to give Menga a clear path, and he scored a goal from the center of the box.
By this stage, the Rangers had had the ball pretty much the whole time, but the home team's defense had proved to be impermeable and goal guard Liam Kelly had little to worry about.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelo performed a near - score that had to be saved by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was blocked by the feet of Rangers-keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithow sent a Livingston Death Ball in a wide pass.
Crossings continued to enter the Livingston box and were constantly saved, while two criminal charges — once after Halkett’s protest against the exchange of Glenn Middleton, and once for a hand — were ignored.
‘Penomenal’ from Livingston – Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and a phenomenal outcome for Livingston.
They were all wonderful, and they continue to surpass all expectations on the way up.
The style of the game and the crew have hardly changed since they recovered, but Holt is to be credited with the way he has strengthened the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and coordinated a vastly organized defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes throughout the fight.
The Rangers, on the other hand, did not have my inspiration.
Though they have at times been very good under Gerard, they failed to live up to that standard.
The last part of the game was labs — they only got into the home team’s half once — and it was quite a wake - up for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Everything was just smiles and blue skies on Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the NATO allies.
Disunity has arisen over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press, and the entry of Turkey into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police gave up security as the reason why a 25,000 people were not allowed to gather in front of the mosque, but many followers showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan — many of them Kurds — also heard from them, criticizing both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to let him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the disunity that follows a man who is hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Deptford collision: cyclist killed in a car crash.
A cyclist has been killed in a collision like a car in London.
The crash took place at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of town, about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was treated by paramedics, but the man died on the spot.
The collision takes place only one month after a cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident where the driver escaped from the crime scene on Childrens Street, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.
Metropolitan Police said the police are working to identify the man and alert the next of kin.
Road blocks and bus tours are in place, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: six officers injured in riots.
Six correctional officers have been injured in an incident at a maximum security prison for men, according to the prison authorities.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin, Worcestershire, around 9:30 BST on Sunday, and are still going on.
Specialised Tornado officers have been brought in to handle the incident, involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the scene.
A prison official said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent in to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons; those responsible will be transferred to the police and may spend even more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the warden received hospital treatment after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, the riot police were called in to deal with a serious incident in which employees were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens floodwaters Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (can be beneficial to droughts)
It's the disease Arizona is hit by a tropical depression, but just that will probably happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's residual force moves through the deserts in the southwest and carries flood risk.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the towns of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be moving in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, and the rain will start late Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or low pressure within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane until it was 40 miles [65 km] from the Arizona border.’
The last National Hurricane Center models foresee 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, with up to 15 cm in some places in the Mongol Rim, Arizona.
Other areas within the southwest desert, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin mountain range, are likely to get between 2.5 and 5 cm, while up to 10 cm of precipitation is possible in some areas.
For those outside flood risk, Rosa can be a blessing, since the area suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the Southwest is currently in a drought.
According to the United States Rought Monitor, a little over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa hits land on the Mexican Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa still has hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind force of 137 km, is 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving at 19 km/h.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, thereby losing power.
That's why it's expected to hit Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday night or afternoon.
Precipitation over parts of Mexico can be powerful and dangerous.
‘Total precipitation of 7.5 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to Northwestern Sonora, with potential for up to 25 cm precipitation’, according to weather.com.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm until it hits the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which this moves on through Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
‘The headman expected by Rosa or its remains is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert in the United States’, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to produce deadly floods and floating debris and rapid deserts and landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old male have been arrested, suspected of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area by Midsome Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Sunday.
He was taken to the hospital, and his condition should be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old male were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, according to the police in Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked anyone who might have cell phone footage of the incident to contact us.
Trump says that Kavanaugh has ‘suffered under the petty and the mind’ of the Democratic party
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," said Trump in front of a Council meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has ‘suffered under the petty and the mind’ of the Democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the convention on Thursday, denying the strong and emotional charges from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford is also being testified about his charge at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw where brilliant, capable and brave ” Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote to support Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to support one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, with impeccable conduct in public service," he told an audience of his supporters in Western Virginia.
The president discreetly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about how important it is that Republicans vote at middle elections.
'We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices of our lifetime.
I'm not really a participant, but I'm a participant," he said.
“That is why I travel and fight for the best candidates.”
Trump claimed that Democrats aim to ‘stand and prevent’.
The Senate's first ballot on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to what the assistant of a Republican Party leader has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian landslides and tsunamis, the figures are expected to rise
At least 384 were killed and many were dragged to sea by huge waves pounding on the beaches when a major earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Slawesi, according to the government on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to 20 feet [6 m] high waves pounded ashore around sunset, destroyed everything in their path, and dragged many into drowning.
Tsunami came on the heels of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
‘When the tsunami father appeared yesterday, people were still engaged in activities on the beach, did not immediately escape and end up as victims,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s Emergency Management Agency (BNBP) at a press conference in Jakarta.
‘The tsunami was not alone — it carried cars, tree trunks and houses, hit everything on land,’ said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to flee from the tsunami and survived."
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Emergency Management Department showed many damaged buildings and shops, twisted and crushed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued shaking the coastal city on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes could be felt by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the assessment and use of technology (BPPT) declared that the power of Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times more than that of the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s position at the end of a long, narrow bay may have added to the tsunami, according to the department.
Nugroho described the damage as “exhaustive” and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death tolls and injuries may be the coast of larger countries 200 miles [300 km] north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the heart of the earthquake.
The communication ‘was completely crippled, completely without information’ from Donggala, according to Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, ” said the Red Cross in a press release, adding that their personnel and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
He said, "This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
On Saturday the department was severely criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had struck before the warning was issued.
A social - media amateur hears a man on the top floor of a building shouting desperate warnings that the tsunami is approaching passersby on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water dashes toward the beach, tearing buildings and cars.
Reuters has not been able to immediately authenticate the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that has prevented communication around Palu and made it difficult for the government to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun to send transport aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other necessities.
The city's airport is only open for relief work and will be closed by October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami rises over 800.
It's horrible.
World Vision’s staff from Donggala have made it safely to the center of Palu, where they have taken shelter under the tarpaulin tent in the courtyard in front of their office, but they passed great destruction on the road, according to Doseba Sinay.
"They told me they saw hundreds of broken houses," he said.
It's horrible.
As relief agencies began their dismal preparations to provide emergency relief, some complained that foreign relief workers with much expertise were refused to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, money, supplies and workers from abroad cannot be released into an emergency area until it is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
'It is still a provincial disaster' said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'Okay, this is a national disaster,' we can open the borders of international aid, but the situation has not yet gained any status."
As the sun sets on Palu for the second time after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be among the miracle stories that brighten the grim news picture of tragic natural disasters.
Saturday, a little boy was fished out of a sewer.
On Sunday a woman was freed by rescuers after spending two days trapped under ruins with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandano, coach of the National Paralliding Team, had trained two of the missing paraglidians for Asia Games, carried out earlier this month in Indonesia.
Several of those trapped in the ruins of the Roa Roa Hotel, including Petra Mandai, were also his students.
“ As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional needs to bear, ” he said.
Gendon told me that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel was spread in the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the performers who attended the beach festival at the Palu.
But the reports only led to gray chin marks, rather than a few blue chin marks.
‘I think that means that the messages were not delivered,’ he said.
Thieves are stealing USD 26 750 during ATM refilling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole USD 26 750 from a Brink's worker who filled an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver had emptied an ATM into the entertainment complex and was getting ready to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
While he was busy, there was another man who "run up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects escaping the scene, according to the press release, but the police have not specified how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity must contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West, the rapper's changing his name to Ye.
The rapper Kanye West changes his name — to Ye.
When he announced the amendment on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote, "The capitol formerly known as Kanye West."
West (41) has been nicknamed Ye for a long time, using the name as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album, Yandhi.
He's replacing the singer Ariana Grande on the program, after she canceled on "emotional basis", according to the serial maker.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," said West earlier this year, when discussing the album title with the radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, and I am us, it is we.
It went from being Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye alone — a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more of a representation of who we are."
He's one of many famous rappers who've changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as both Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has also varied between the use of hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO swears not to use the military against civilians.
The president-elect of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has sworn that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he “will never ever use the military to suppress the Mexican people”.
Military troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the marketplace on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people, during a period when left-wing student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to students and opening up several free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead youths into criminal gangs.
The United States should double financial support for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount spent on research in this field, according to Kai Fu Lee, the investor and artificial intelligence practitioner, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
His comments come after several departments of the U.S. government have issued announcements regarding artificial intelligence, although the United States generally does not have a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
China, in turn, introduced a plan last year and aims to be number one in innovation for artificial intelligence by 2030.
“ A double research budget for artificial intelligence will be a good starting point since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next major breakthrough, ” said Lee.
Double financial support may double the chance that the next great achievement in artificial intelligence comes from the United States, Lee reported in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order ” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the director of Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University to develop a system of artificial intelligence that beat the best Othello player in the United States, and later was a leader of Microsoft Research or Director of Google's Chinese Division.
Lee recognized the former U.S. government technology contests, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next will be held to help find the next generation's wise heads.
Researchers in the United States often have to work very hard to receive government appropriations, according to Lee.
"It is not China that steals the academic leaders, it is the corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired smart heads from universities to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee says that changes in immigration policies can also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in artificial intelligence.
‘I believe that those with a doctorate in artificial intelligence should receive a residence permit automatically, ’ he said.
China's Minister of State, his Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation finances academic institutions, in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but, according to Lee, the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the United States Defense Department set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced an investment on USD 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, they are currently investing more than USD 100 million in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the U.S. legislation aimed at establishing a National Safety Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been suspended for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name.
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday to change the country’s name to ‘The Republic of Northern Macedonia’ to solve a decades - long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia, believes that the name of the northern neighbour constitutes a claim on Greek territory and has vetoed their inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new hub, but nationalistic opposers argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavonic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjerge Ivanov has said that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has created doubts as to whether the attendance will meet the minimum demand of 50 percent, which is mandatory for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ticket is: ‘Are you for NATO and EU membership in approving the agreement with Greece.’
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying this price for Macedonia, one country that arose after the fall of Yugoslavia, to be able to gain membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO.
‘I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the EU’s protective umbrella, because it means a safer life for all of us, ’ said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, it is likely to be decisive because a high enough number of members of Parliament have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission said they had not received any irregular reports by 1300 hours.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent at the last parliament election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their vote.
“I came to vote because of my children — we belong in Europe, ” said Gjose Tanevski (62) who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov (54) prepared a small scene and pulled out chairs in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the vote.
‘We are positive for NATO and the EU, but we will be reported with our heads raised, not be slooped in the back,’ says Kavadarkov.
They said, "We are a poor land, but we have our dignity.
If they refuse to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to countries like China and Russia and become part of Euroasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will lead much-needed investment into Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
‘I think most people will be for, because more than 80 of our citizens want us to join the EU and NATO,’ said Zaev after voting.
He says that a "yes" answer will be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonia Institute of Political Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum — this is lower than the required turnout.
Another survey, carried out by Macedonia’s Telma TV, revealed that 57 percent of blacks plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout has to be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it will constitute the first serious political obstacle the pro-western government has encountered since it took over last May.
Look, Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvers past Brighton's entire defense to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling crushed the Brighton defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored a goal in 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced three Brighton defenders before he got out on the open field.
Then four green shirts surrounded Aguero.
He got around one defender before he ran from several on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he sent a pass to the left that reached Sterling.
The English attacker used his first touch in the box to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat Brighton’s goaler Matthew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
‘Aguero is still struggling with some foot problems’, City manager Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
It was fortunate that he had achieved a goal at that time."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the original advantage in the Premier League fight.
This target arrived in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball placed inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a beautiful breakthrough pass along the left flank to Leory Sane.
Sane had a couple of touches before he led Sterling to the longest corner.
The Sky Blues attacker sent the ball into the net just before it was over the dead line.
City is playing Hoffenheim in the Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will be spoiler for the Rockies.
The Nationals are no longer candidates for playoffs, and they have no reason to bet heavily.
The ever-like competitive Scherzer still hopes to be on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can affect the playoff opportunities of the Colorado team, which leads over the Los Angeles Dodgers with one game in the NL West.
Rockies got a wild card spot with a five to two victory over Nationals Friday night, but he's still out to secure his first divisional title.
Even if we have nothing to win, we can at least play with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team, will be the most likely to be the highest level of combat I get to play this year.
Why should I not be a part of it?"
The Nationals have still not announced their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are said to be inclined to take Scherzer pitche in such a situation.
Sherzser, who in that case is starting pitcher for the 34th time, had a bullpen session on Thursday, and will throw with normal rest on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player this season has won 18 games and lost 7, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts of 220 2/3 innings.
Trump’s People’s Assembly in Western Virginia
The president discreetly referred to the situation surrounding the Supreme Court nomination Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke of the importance of Republican votes in the middle elections.
“ Everything we have done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
This is one of the big, big... I'm not a contestant, but I'm a participant, and that's why I'm traveling around fighting for the best candidates, he said.
Trump continued: "You see this cruel, cruel group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to take power back at all costs, and there you see the pettiness and the meanness.
They do not care who they hurt, whom they run away to gain power and control. This is what they want, power and control. We shall not give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, aim to resist.
"And you're looking at it over the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "evil and mean and gross and dishonest."
He referred to the Senate Court Committee and mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, on which the audience arched loudly.
“ Do you remember her answer?
Have you leaked the document?
Um, um, what.
No, but I am waiting for one – that is very bad body language – the worst body language I have ever seen.”
Labour is no longer open to everyone.
They don't tolerate people who speak their mind.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was hardly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome just because we say what we mean.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she was very critical of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was to be censored because I did not agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, regarding national security, about Europe — ironically, similar cases that Jeremy disagreed with former leaders.
The report for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that ‘we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive’.
For most of my eight years as the local Labour representative, the GC meetings on Friday nights have been exactly this.
Unfortunately, this is no longer the mood of many of the meetings, and the promise of softer, kinder policy is long forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not allowed in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged to be acceptable to the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when former colleagues I thought that I shared many political attitudes with suddenly began to expect that I would make a U-turn and stand for opinions I had never previously agreed with, they agreed with national security or the internal market of the EU.
When I speak publicly — and it doesn’t matter what I say — I receive a wealth of ugly messages on social media that demand that I be dismissed, condemn downtown politics, and tell me that I shouldn’t be in Labour.
And I'm not the only one who's been through this.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I usually receive are political.
I know how professional and targeted these co-workers are when they meet a sea that sexist and racist comments every day but never let themselves be subdued.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of gross name calling.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a tolerance culture.
The truth is, we're no longer a party that's open to everyone, and every vote of no confidence and every change in the election rules is narrowing the party.
I have received much advice in the last two years where I am encouraged to keep my head down and not raise my voice so much, because it will ‘make everything better’.
But that's not why I got involved in politics.
Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the failure of the Thatcher government, which had led to my classroom in the public school I attended as a virtual failure, I have fought for better public service for those who need them most, both as local councilman and minister of government.
I have never concealed my political opinions, nor in my previous election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have misunderstood my political attitudes or disagreements with current leadership.
I just want to say to the people who presented the proposal on Friday, that since our country is rushing towards a Brexit that would harm individuals, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Leader.
But the message I really want to convey is not to Nottingham Momentum — it is to those I represent, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of resignation or political uncompromising will prevent me from doing what I think best of your interests.
Chris Leslie is the representative of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeshaved Ayr rises to the top
Two late attempts have changed the end result a little, but there was no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this fantasticly entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
They are now at the top of the table and are the only undefeated of the ten.
Finally, as much their superior defense as their ability to take advantage of the opportunities that led to the victory of the home team, Coach Peter Murchie had good reason to be satisfied.
'We have been challenged in our battles so far and are still undefeated, so I must be satisfied with that,' he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "All honor to Ayr, they were better at taking advantage of opportunities than we were."
Grant Anderson's attempt for the 14th minute, with the goal kick from Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card to Scotland Captain Rory Hughes, loaned from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the position, and Jason Baggot performed an attempt without a goal kick.
Climo strengthened Ayr's leadership with a penalty kick before he, just before the break, scored and targeted a solo attempt to change his position to 17-5 on a break.
But Melrose started the second half strong, and Patrick Anderson's experiment, with the goal kick from Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
This was a long stay in connection with a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, carried out on the stretcher, and from the reboot, Ayr administration increased even more oath from Stafford McDowell, with the goal kick from Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blain Macpherson, then received yellow cards and Melrose took advantage of having an extra man on the field to the fullest with an attempt from Bruce Colvine without a goal kick, at the end of a period of high pressure.
However, the home team came back strongly, and when Struen Hutchinson received a yellow card for dealing with Climo when he didn't have the ball, MacPherson performed a touchdown at the point behind the advancing Ayr-Maul.
Climo performed a target kick, as he did again almost all the way from the start, after Kyle Rowe caught up with David Armstrong's box kick and sent flanks Gregor Henry away for the fifth time of the home team.
The Still Game star is ready for a new career in the restaurant business.
It seems that the Still Game star Ford Kieran is on his way into the catering business - he was recently discovered to be named as director of a bar company with a liquor license.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC program for which he writes and plays along with his long-term comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The pigeon has announced that the coming ninth season will be the last season of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is now planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source from The Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "live restaurant business".
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia, a land without shoreline, hopes that the court will open the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a rigging-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings raise a sea blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are decorated with the motto: “We are entitled to the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
The entire Inland State of Bolivia is still fresh in memory of the coastline they lost to Chile during a 19th-century bloody resource conflict, and the country longs to sail the Pacific once again.
These hopes may be greater than they have been in decades, as Bolivia await a decision from the International Court on October 1 after five years of discussion.
‘Bolivia has a driving force, a community spirit and calmness, and, of course, waits for the result with a positive attitude,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the large - screen verdict of the International Court of Justice in many parts of the country, hoping that the Court of Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia its own outlet to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president — faced with a controversial reelection campaign next year — has also put a lot of money into Monday’s verdict.
"We are very close to a return to the Pacific," he promised late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would hardly take Bolivia’s side and that very little would change if it had.
The UN agency, which resided in the Netherlands, has no authority to allow them to give away Chilean lands, and has suggested that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the decision of the International Court comes only six months after the last arguments were heard that the case was “not complicated”, according to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And rather than promoting Bolivia's case, over the last four years, things might actually have made things worse.
‘The problem with access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration’, said Zárate.
She believes that Morales' antagonistic rhetoric has drained away any residual goodwill left on Chile's side.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at one point or another, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the matter after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative at The Hague, rejected the theory that the court’s decision was exceptionally rapid.
According to him on Monday, Bolivia will "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new generation of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "stop 139 years of disagreement in favour of both parties".
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — has used the maritime situation as a political cover.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific, ” he added.
(It will be said to them): "The knowledge is an opportunity to see what we must do to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless they can trust the United States.
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless they can trust the U.S. government.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep their promises during a meeting of the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
These comments will coincide with that of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appears to be ready to launch the sealed nuclear diplomats, more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with the Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it's a "dream" that continued sanctions and American resistance to is a declaration that ends the Korean War will ever force North Korea to its knees.
The U.S. government is skeptical about accepting the Declaration without Pyongyang’s first taking on significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, president of the United States, want to have a second meeting.
However, there is widespread doubt as to whether Pyongyang really plans to let go of an arsenal that the country probably considers to be the only security guarantee they have.
Pompey plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest in enormous headgear, headed for a clothing store near you
If you want any large additions to your hat collection or to hide completely from the sun, you will no longer have to search.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a selection of odd, oversized headgear as part of their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which impressed the fashion lions on the fashion week in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been popular on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their spectacular creations down the catwalk.
Valentino’s most spectacular garment was an oversized beige arrayed with a featherlike broad brim that drowned the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, or even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep their heads warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had remade lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the last scream.
One creation resembled diving equipment, including snorkels and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in biscuits.
And if you're looking for even more large fashion accessories, then you're in luck.
Style experts predict that the giant hats could be headed for a clothing store near you.
The oversized hats come right on the heels of La Bomba, the straw hat with a two-foot wide brim that's been seen on everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult mark behind the highly impractical hat that dominated social media has now sent yet another large creation down the catwalk — a beach bag in straw almost as large as the bathing suit that carries it.
The orange raffia bag, which is edged with raffia fringes and completed with a white leather handle, was the most conspicuous creation in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at fashion week in Paris.
Luke Armitage’s famous author said to the FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beachbags in the clothing shops next summer – when the designer has had such a great impact it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories. ”
John Edward: Language skills are crucial to world citizens
Scotland’s freshols show a continuing academic excellence, and this has persisted in 2018 with another year of excellent examination results, supported by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
These schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (the Scottish Free School Council), have more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland and work hard to deliver the best school experience to both students and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As an educational board that can design and implement a tailor - made school curriculum, modern languages are increasingly popular and sought - after courses in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, his words reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words of his heart will reach you."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the year’s examination show that languages are at the top of the table with the highest percentages from charters.
A total of 68 percent of foreign - language students received the A degree.
The data, obtained from the 74 colleges of the Free School Council, showed that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin exams, while 72 percent of students in Germany, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received A.
This illustrates that in Scotland, freshols support foreign languages as a crucial skill children and youths will no doubt need in the future.
Languages as a trade are now valued at the level of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics in the curriculum for health schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 showed that for the reasons employers gave for having problems with job opening, 17 percent could be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important to clarify young people for a future career.
As more and more job opportunities demand language skills, these skills become decisive in a globalized world.
If you've learned a second language, these lifelong skills will bring real benefits in the future, no matter what career you choose.
Direct communication with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov study answered by more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was the only language a two-digit number of participants (15 percent) could speak.
That is why investment in language training is now crucial for today’s children.
More languages, especially those associated with emerging economies, will give children better opportunities to find good jobs.
In Scotland if each school teaches different languages.
Many schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most valuable to the United Kingdom on the way to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Regardless of what interests your child, there will always be a choice of languages to choose from in charter schools, with teachers who are experts in this field.
Scots are designed to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may bring.
It cannot be denied in today's global business environment that language remains essential to the future of the country, and this needs to be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered ‘international communication’.
Free schools will continue to offer this opportunity, diversity, and award to Scotland’s youths.
I faut been le faire.
John Edward is president of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (Scottish Free School Council)
LeBron is having his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason opening game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he's playing is still not settled.
"There will be more than one and less than 48", said Walton on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trundel wrote on Twitter that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked what his plans were for the Lakers' six-game preseason plan.
“I don’t need preseason fights at this stage of my career, ” he replied.
Time of Trump Folk Meeting in Western Virginia, YouTube Channel
Mr. President starts a series of electoral meetings tonight, Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned people's meetings in the next week, including stops in cities where he has a lot of support, like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the confirmation vote for his elected Supreme Court candidate is on hold, Trump aims to obtain support for the upcoming midterm elections, since Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voters go to the ballot boxes in November.
When are Trump's West Virginia people meeting tonight, and how can it be seen online?
Trump's people meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is about to start at 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can see Trump's Folk Meeting in Western Virginia online below via live feed on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week's hearings of the Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, and an expected confirmation vote has been placed on hold for up to one week while the FBI investigates the case.
The main objective of all these public meetings is to support Republicans who face challenging elections in November.
President Trump has therefore stated that during the next few weeks, these five public meetings aim to “inflame volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives, ” according to Reuters.
‘Congress control is so vital to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move towards a busy campaign season’, Reuters was told by a campaign spokesperson for Trump who did not want to be named.
Tonight's public meeting, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and be covered by the Pittsburgh Press," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month Trump has visited Western Virginia, a state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who's behind in the polls.
"It's a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, an expert on political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018, U.S. team showing a fighting spirit to keep the faith as they enter Sunday's single game.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes may have been exactly what Ryder Cup of the year needed.
The swinging pendulum of the Momentum is a completely fictional concept of sports, yet the players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
And where do they think the momentum is now?
'They led by six points, and now there are four, so I guess we carry it with us as a little moment," said Jordan Spieth when he left the field for the day.
Of course, Europe will have the advantage — they lead by four points and there are 12 left to play for.
But as Spieth says, Americans feel a little wind in their sails again, and they have good reason to feel inspired, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has delivered excellent games from tee to green, leading by example.
The deep cries of celebration grew higher as his round continued, and sank to a crucial pitting to raise the match to a tie when he and Thomas were two below by two.
His punting, which won them the 15 - year - old match, was met with a similar scream — by the kind that shows that he still does not believe that the American team is without a chance.
"We really just have to put all the rags on and focus on our own match," said Spieth.
That's all each of these players has now.
18 holes to make an impression.
The only players who've scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undoubtedly Ryder Cup's great success story.
Europe's unusual, but wonderful couples have four out of four and don't make a mistake.
Moliwood was the only couple who avoided a Bogey on Saturday afternoon and also avoided Bogey’s Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
These results and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the lively crowd make it clear that they are the biggest competitors of Sunday, and there are no other players who would rather see a European victory as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Freetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time, in separate holes.
It's still too early to declare Europe the winner.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt easily with Sergio Garcia, morning fourball hero when he was partnered with Alex Noren.
After one Bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede were so behind that they did not have a chance to catch up.
But on Sunday, there's no help.
Fourballs and foursomes are very interesting to see at close quarters because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give each other, the counsel they do not give and how a strategy can reverse in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, and it's way ahead of the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that team America has some people, especially in the United States, missing.
Europe leads 10 to 6 at the beginning of the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a strong head start at the beginning of Ryder Cups last day, after completing Sunday's fourballs and foursomes match with 10-6 leading towards the United States.
The brilliant duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two victories against a broken Tiger Woods and raised their score to Le Golf National so far to four points.
Thomas Bjørn's European side, struggling to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated America's unfortunate side in the morning's fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The United States gave more resistance to the Foursomes and won two games, but they didn't catch up on any of the jumps.
Jim Furyk's side has to score eight points from Sunday's 12 singles game to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari — nicknamed “Molliwood” together after a sensational weekend — are the only couple to score four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup’s history.
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball, they cooperated seamlessly to beat down Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with even more emphatic 5/4.
Woods, who limped through two matches on Saturday, flashed occasionally, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for morning fourballs, returned to partner Henry Stevensen in the foursomes and awarded a 2/1 victory against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked number one and three worldwide.
But Europe didn't get everything the way they wanted on this hot day with light breezes southwest of Paris.
Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, three winners of majors, set the standard for Americans by two points on Saturday.
They got a hard-fighter over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs, and they came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup's history has a team managed to recover from a four-point head start at the start of the single game, but as current holders only need Furyk's side to win a draw to keep the trophy.
But after being second best for two days, it seems that they will not be able to deliver a counterattack on Saturday.
North Korea will “by no means” agree to unilateral disarmament without any help
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions strengthened distrust of the United States and that the country will by no means agree to one-sidedly let go of its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world organisation that North Korea has carried out significant goodwill measures during the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing area and promising not to spread nuclear and nuclear technologies.
“We still have not seen a similar response from the United States,” he said.
‘Without confidence in the United States, we have no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not, under any circumstances, arm ourselves unilaterally first.’
Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a gradual nuclear disarmament, where North Korea is rewarded for gradual detoxification, but his declaration was significant because it did not fully reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued in Singapore on 12 June, at the very first meeting of a sitting president of the United States and a North Korean leader, where Kim promised to work towards the "atom disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump guaranteed the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first let go of his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also countered requests to reduce severe international sanctions against North Korea.
'The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and raises the pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective coercedly and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war''', according to Ri.
"The belief that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream for people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions create further mistrust."
Ride did not mention plans for a second encounter between Kim and Trump that the American leader stressed before the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: “If the other party in this disarmament case were South Korea, rather than the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not have been as locked up as it is. ”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from that of last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on mainland America with North Korea's missiles was inevitable after Mr. Evil President called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
After threatening to “completely destroy” North Korea last year, Trump stood this year in front of the United Nations and commended Kim for being brave enough to take disarmament steps, but said that much work remains to be done, and the sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is nuclearally disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump saw that he did not have a time frame for this and said that ‘It does not matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months.’
China and Russia feel that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo informed the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that “the sanctions of the Security Council must still be enforced severely and without exception, until we have achieved complete, final and confirmed nuclear disarmament.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to stifle funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile weapons program.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly’s sidelines and afterward said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare another summit meeting.
Pompey's visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that they had prospered, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making "gostic demands".
North Korea made a commitment to a meeting with Moon this month to shut down a missile field and a nuclear weapon facility if the United States made ‘equivalent actions’.
He said Kim had said that these “corresponding measures” he wanted were safety guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalise his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking classes in getting enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year will help students to get more sleep by coping with the growing culture of studying through the night with caffeine drinks as fuel.
One scholar found that students at the world’s best university often had no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the United States.
He started the course after giving a talk on the effect sleep deprivation has on learning.
'After the discourse, a girl came to me and said, 'Why has no one said this before?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which starts this year, explains to students the importance of good sleep habits in order to perform academicly and athletically, as well as in general health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and CEO of university health care, said that the university decided to start the course after they saw that the students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation.
The course, which lasts for an hour, has a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a room in a dormitory, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books and learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deprivation and how important a sleep routine is.
In another section, participants learn how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus with interactive icons causes participants to reflect on their own daily routine.
‘We are aware that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe that they have a right to know about this, just as you have a right to know about the risks of smoking, ” said Professor Czeisler.
There is still some pride in studying the whole night, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure on students led to an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Enough and good sleep should be the students ’ secret weapons against stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said — even as a cure for weight gain, when sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, resulting in constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, took one of the classes to the professor last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course inspired him to work for a course that was available to the entire campus.
Next step, he hopes, is to ask all the grad students to do a similar study program before they're enrolled in the university.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm for when they would go to bed as well as for when they would get up, and that they would have to be aware of the harmful effects of blue lights from electronic monitors and LED lights, which can interfere with daily rhythm and lead to sleep difficulties.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers, Menga targets Gerard's men.
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Menga's target struck Steven Gerard's team 1-0 on Livingston.
The Ibrox page wanted its first victory since February's victory 4-1 on St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left his eight points from Ladbrokes Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers were never able to equalize.
The Rangers are now falling to sixth place, while Livingston climbs to third and is behind Hibernian on the goal difference.
There may be more trouble brewing for the Rangers after Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the away audience.
Gerard made eight turns on the team that swept past Ayr and into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
On the other hand, Holt went for the same Livi 11 who made a point from Hearts last week, and he would have been glad how his well - trained team beat his opponents.
The Rangers may have had the most possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with it while they had it.
They should have scored just two minutes into the game when Mengas first pass sent Scott Pittman through on Allan McGregor's goal, but the middleman blew his shot.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot at the goal pole.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed to lean more on hope than belief in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos thought he should have a penalty kick after 15 minutes, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson refused.
The Rangers only made two rounds of targets in the first place, but ex-Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly didn't have a problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening for 34 minutes may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their efforts.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't handle a deep game from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool when he picked out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent on the break, and the game exchange brought immediate results when the wing player sent to Morelos, but Kelly ran off her line to block.
Livingston, however, succeeded in getting away players to play just the kind of game they like, as Littong and Halkett caught up long ball after long ball.
Holt's side could've stretched the lead in the last place, but McGregor stood up to Jacobs before the Lithgow headet from the corner.
Rangers exchanger Glenn Middleton probably had a late claim to a penalty kick when he got into conflict with Jacobs, but once again, Thomson looked away.
Almanken: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, was the day the future physicist John Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the device known today as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has been an important part of science since then and also became part of popular culture through the 1950 Bells of Coronado film, with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He said, "What is that?"
Rogers said, "It is a Geiger counter which finds radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you touch these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by radioactivity in the minerals.’
Evans, (saying): "Is there a sound now?"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he named lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise cancer cells as part of the treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and changing them in a laboratory.
Cells can now “see” a protein common to many cancers and then be injected back into the patient
A vaccine during testing has had promising results among patients with different types of cancers.
One woman who received the vaccine, who teaches her immune system to recognize cancer cells, had a loss of her ovarian respirator for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2, which is typical of many types of cancer, and then re-injecting these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 ‘drivers the growth of various cancers’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were taken from the patient and trained to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West, wearing a MAGA hat, came up with a strong defense of Trump after the SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a fumbling performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he'd run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a make America Great Again hat, he stretched out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
'So often do I talk to a white person, and then he says, 'How can you like Trump? He is a racist?'
If I was afraid of racism, I'd have left the United States a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch of Matt Damon, where the Hollywood Star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judicial Committee about the charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it wasn't broadcast, the recording of West was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock wanted to ridicule West by posting the tape.
West also complained to the audience that he heard it in the back room about choosing headgear.
They said, "They bullied me.
They said, "Do not go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they said I don't understand what the reality is," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West said: "Would you see that I know what the reality is?" He said: "Put on the robe of Superman, for then no one can tell me what to do; do you want the world to move forward?"
Seek love."
His comments were booed at least twice, and the employees who worked at SNL looked so embarrassed, Variety reported, where a staff member said: “The entire studio was dying. ”
West was brought in as the last substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, when her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many when he performed the song "I Love It" dressed like a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “To one of our bravest: THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING THE MASSES. ”
But talkshowvert Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is and it's absolutely fantastic."
‘But I choose not to reward anyone by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art ’) which I believe is an idol and spews out ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name, saying that from now on he was "the entity formally known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper fellow Snoop Dogg has been known as Snoop Lion, and then, of course, the late Musician Prince changed his name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder after stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackmore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to be presented to Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington deals with "gay masculinity."
Kit Harington is known from the role of sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO's violent fantasy series added to the Middle Ages, Game of Thrones.
However, the 31 - year - old actor has gone out and criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles in movies often make young men think they must be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that something went wrong and wondered how to attack the problem of "toxic masculinity" in this #MeToo time.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones fellow Rose Leslie, also 31 years of age, admitted that he was very concerned about the subject.
“It worries me quite a bit these days — where did the masculinity go wrong? ” he said.
"How have we raised men for the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partly to blame for the increase in "marginal masculinity" because of the strong masculine roles.
He said: What is born and what is learned?
What is conveyed on TV and on the streets, what makes young boys feel that they have to grow this particular aspect of being a man?
I think it is one of the really big questions today — how can we change that?
Surely it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also admits that he will not make any forerunners or successors of Game of Thrones at the end of the series next summer, and says that he is finished with battlefields and horses.
From November on, Kit will be playing the lead in a re-recording of Sam Shepard True West, and this is the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
“ I met my wife on the recordings, so that way something good came out of it — my future family and my life from now on, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow is in love with, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family property in Scotland.
Hive/aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported an increase of as many as 14% in the population of HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, says the health official.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, marking a change from earlier.
Traditionally, infection in certain parts of China spread rapidly through blood transfusions.
However, the number of people receiving HIV this way is now closer to zero, said Chinese health care professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Each year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGDs is said to be high.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the disease is due to insufficient protection from sex in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised general access to HIV medicine as part of an intervention to address the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the fact that our co-worker leaked data on Republican senators, sneezes from "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Member of the House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, rejected Saturday charges that members of her staff had posted their personal data to three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Democrat of Los Angeles assured by the claims was made by ‘ultraconservative’ commentators and websites.
“Liars, lies, and more reprehensible lies, ” said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The published information supposedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a panel hearing in the Senate about the assault charges against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak arrived shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the source behind the post was traced to Waters' office and revealed information about a member of Waters' staff, according to Hill.
‘This unfounded charge is completely false and a outright lie’, Waters continued.
‘The members of my staff who have received their identities, personal data and security compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false charges — had absolutely no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a outright lie.’;»
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is aggressive", wrote Fleischer.
‘This suggests that she does not have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When people are accused of something they have not done, they must not be aggressive.
They must not defend themselves.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must be calm and apprehended.’
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing aggressive at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who works to eliminate Waters in the middle elections, also aired his thoughts on Twitter.
'Big, if true' he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had notified “relevant authorities and police about these false charges”.
‘We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed’, she continued ‘and that they are held responsible for all acts that are destructive and dangerous to each of my staff’.
Reported by Johnny English Strikes Against — anemic Rowan Atkinson in spy parody
It's become a tradition now to look for Brexit references in every new film with a British tilting look and it seems to be relevant to this resurgence of the parodyfranchise Johnny English action comedy that started in 2003 with Johnny English and was resurrected in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Would sarcastic self-satire about how obviously hopeless we are to become the nation's new export product?
in any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his bulging eyes and the rubber face has renewed his license to screw things up for the second time – his name says more than anything else that he is a clear and comical figure intended for territories with non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre James Bond ambitions, is a blend of Clouseau, a dump Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes one single note to the music section with the theme of the fire wagon at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
He's also originally based on the role Atkinson played in the long forgotten TV ads for Barclaycard; the traveler and international mystery man who leaves chaos everywhere.
It's one and another great moment in the last Johnny English mission.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in medieval gear and the rotor blades grazed his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy comes to grips with his rights, but humor feels quite arid and strangely redundant, especially now that the "serious" brands that 007 and Mission Impossible are willingly missing have the features of comedy.
The humor seems to be more focused on children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's fades are not as inventive and pointed as the silent film in Mr Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all the British agents in the field, to the horror of the sentry agent, a regrettable little role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister, a pompous and dejected figure who's already going through a complete crisis of political impulsivity: Emma Thompson is doing a very good job with this fake Teresa-May role, but the script doesn't give her much to work with.
Her intelligence advisors are informing us that since every active spy has been compromised, she needs to bring in some of the retired.
And that means the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at a snobby establishment, but provides unofficial instruction in secret intelligence.
English is snatched back to Whitehall for a quick briefing and reunited with his old troubled helper Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, spliced with a submarine commander, a hysterical upper-class lady role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So the Batman and the Robin way of messing things up on a mission for the Queen is back, where they confront Olga Kurylenko with fantastic femme fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is seduced by the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's cyber problems: the insidious Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey with farcelike indiscretions: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant, causing chaos while hiding aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English unleashes anarchy as he tries to use a VR device to make himself known in Volta's house.
All the stops are really being pulled out before the final sequence, but even so gracious and noisy there's a lot of things that look like kids' tv with the whole thing.
Pretty mediocre, all of it.
And as with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role in which he can really use his talent?
Labour denies making plans for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
The Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will give the British four-day workweek, but get paid for five.
The party seems to want business leaders to spend savings on the revolution of artificial intelligence by giving employees an extra day of the week off.
This will give employees a three - day weekend, at the same time receiving the same salary.
Sources say that the idea fits the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country in favour of employees.
The unions support the transition to four-day weeks so that workers can also enjoy the benefits of the new economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A political review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
‘It will not happen overnight, but the four-day week is an ambition consistent with the party’s desire to let the pendulum swing to the benefit of the workers — in addition to the party’s overall industrial strategy’.
Labour won't be the first to back up an idea like this.
However, the whole Labour Party does not support the idea.
A spokesman for Labour said: ‘A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party’.
Financial spokesman for Labour, John McDonnell, used the Labour Conference last week to expand his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to regain power from ‘faceless directors’ and ‘ profiteers’ of public service providers.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies are in danger of not recovering the entire stock because a Labour government can make a “deduct” out of perceived injustice.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate directors and set up employee funds to transfer 10 % of the equity of private sector companies to the employees, who may receive an annual income of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are telling 60 Minutes about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh that could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of the Bureau might change the views of some Republican senators.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in 60 Minutes asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open to it than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
“I told him at the beginning of the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Judge Judge Judge Kavanaugh.
I contacted him after the charges came out and asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was firm, confident, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
“I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and it must be a startling discovery,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing Brett denied it energetically," added Graham and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
“ And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don't think anything new will change that."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it helped combat poverty?
On this Saturday, New York is host to the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with an impressive list of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission; to eradicate the world’s poverty.
Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will cause thousands of people to flock to the vast central park lawn, not only to experience the sizes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a further development of the Global Poverty Project, an international task force hoping to combat poverty by making more people actively work against poverty.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless one is willing to pay for a VIP ticket), participants had to perform a number of tasks, or ‘actions’, such as volunteer work, send an e-mail message to a world leader, make a telephone call or in other meaningful ways to raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been when there are now only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way of getting people to fight for change, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - that people feel they contribute greatly by signing a petition online or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from their trailers, with a wealth of different targets.
These actions, they say, have helped world leaders declare commitments and politics equivalent to more than $37 billion that will improve the situation for more than $2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group could refer to 390 exposures and announcements as a result of their actions, with at least $10 billion already being paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secured funding so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main exposures are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and entrepreneurs based in the United Kingdom who will ‘help children exploit their full potential’ and pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after receiving over 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," told the ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in Britain to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition programs.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the website, "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult road — sometimes we will fall and fall.
But as the important civil rights and anti-apartecide movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, from Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who are performing this year's event in New York, who will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the Navy as a block to prevent Russian energy export minister
Washington may "if necessary" resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets, including the Middle East, revealed the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially when they operate at the invitation of the legal government — is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
‘I think the reason they're in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe, ’ he said.
And according to the spokesperson, there are always ways and means to deal with this.
‘The U.S. through the Navy has the opportunity to ensure that the waterways are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that the energy does not reach the market’, he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants at the event held by Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that features itself as the ‘voice of energy consumers’ in the United States.
Comparing Washington’s ways of interacting with Russia and Iran, he noted that they are far alike.
‘The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel’, he said, referring to Russia as ‘one trick pony’ with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The opinions were made after the Trump administration took a tour to strengthen the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe; they want to replace Russia, the most cheap option for European consumers.
Members of the Trump administration, including the president himself, therefore tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ‘unsuitable’ project The North European gas pipeline 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the ‘prisoner’ of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion worth of the North European gas pipeline, which will double the existing gas pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is motivated only for economic reasons and is an example of fraudulent competition.
‘I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and consumer choice of supplier,’ said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has met with opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, BDI, has asked the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have serious problems with third countries interfering with our energy supply’, said Dieter Kempf, head of the BDI after a recent meeting between German chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian president Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be thinking seriously about her 2020 presidential campaign, says Senator of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "consider seriously" whether she would run for president after the middle elections.
At a rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she will run.
"It's time for women to get to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes a woman on top," she said, according to The Hill.
‘After November 6th, I want to think seriously about running for president’.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump at the election meeting and said that he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am concerned to the marrow about what Donald Trump is doing to democracy, ” she said.
Warren has been open in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before a vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own voters don't think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator shouldn't run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% supported her candidacy.
The poll showed higher support for former Governor Deval Patrick, and 38% supported a possible candidacy and 48% were against it.
Other high - profile democratic names discussed in a potential candidacy in 2020 include Vice President Joe Biden and the senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'd officially decide by January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin points out Track Palin's PTSD at Trump's voter meeting.
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after coming home, I have in common with other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of our vulnerability our soldiers carry," she told the audience at a election event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room ” and said of his son and other veterans:“ They come home a little changed, they come home hardened, they come home wondering if this is the respect for what their soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have contributed to the country. ”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with a woman, screwing with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police in Wasilla.
18 states and D.C. support testing of new asylum policies
Eighteen states and District of Columbia support a legal trial of a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. presented a briefing from Amicus Curiae (friend of the court) in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged politics, reported NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case that American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal police has not been published.
She claimed that her partner "and his violent gangbangers' sons" abused her, but officials in the United States rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce large numbers of asylum seekers for the United States, as nations that have deep - seated problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy in the United States reversed a decision in 2014 by the Court of Appeals for immigrants granting undocumented immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of the District of Columbia stated on Friday that the new policy ‘looks away from decades of state, federal and international law’.
‘Federal law requires that all asylum requirements be determined by the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition is contrary to that principle’ said the briefing by the Amicus Curiae.
The lawyers further argued in their briefing that the policies that denied immigrants access harm the American economy and say that they are highly likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘resides with necessary labour’."
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered immigration magistrates to cease giving asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion’, the Sessions of the June 11th Notice on Politics.
Asyl was never meant to reduce all problems — even serious ones — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate for rescue in Palu — the death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation worsened.
“It was very tense”, says Risa Kusuma, 35 - year - old mother, while comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the converging city of Palu.
“ All the time you see ambulances picking up dead bodies.
Clean water is in short supply’.
Residents could be seen coming to broken homes and searching water - damaged possessions in an effort to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, injured in the 7.5 - strength earthquake, became overcrowded.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, are sitting outside Palus ’ military hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because of ongoing severe aftershocks.
Tears well up in his eyes as he recounts how it felt when the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
'We had no time to save ourselves in safety.
I was pinched by the wall that collapsed, I think," told Haris to the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town to attend a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “trafficking” by “propaganda ads”
A week after a public Chinese newspaper ran a four - page ad in an American newspaper denouncing the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China, Beijing, accused the U.S. press of spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred Wednesday to the China Daily attachment that paid to move into Des Moines Register — Iowa’s largest - selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to get involved in U.S. Congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China rejects.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to influence the U.S. elections marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China, said U.S. officials according to Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked up in an escalating trade war that has resulted in rounds of new customs rates on each other’s imports.
China’s penal code in the early trade war was to strike export companies in states like Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, reports Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China, and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has hit American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a reader's entry in the Des Moines Register of Sunday: "China steps up the harassment by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“ By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government exploits freedom of speech and the open press that we enjoy in America to place a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, ” wrote Branstad.
“ In contrast, ” he wrote, “at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing, you do not find many dissenting opinions and do not experience real reflections among the average Chinese around China’s troubled economic courses, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party. ”
He added: “One of China’s largest newspapers declined the offer to publish ” his article, although he did not announce which newspaper it was.
Republicans scare off female voters before the mid-term election with Kavanaugh-fades, warning analysts.
Since many Republican top biologists support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexual assault, warns analysts that they will have a counterreaction, especially from women, in the upcoming local elections.
Feelings about this have been very strong, and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to move on with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn,’ said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) proposal for a last-second FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget yesterday’s events — they will not forget tomorrow and not in November, ” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn last Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning protesters sang "November Is Coming" as they demonstrated in the corridors of the Senate when the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford reported Mic.
‘Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will explode’, said Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, to the news page.
They say it has already been high, it is true.
But it could be higher, especially among female insecure voters in the suburbs and younger elects between 18 and 29 years of age, which often do not vote even if they dislike the president.’
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing the charges of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s candidate, analysts felt that it would be a counterreaction if the Republicans forced their appointment.
‘This has become a serious mess for the Republican Party,’ said Michael Steele, former president of the RNC (Republic National Committee), early last week, according to NBC News.
‘It is not only about the committee vote or the final approval or whether Kavanaugh is inaugurated — it is also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this and how they have treated her’, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities U.S.A., pointed out a group promoting the election of democratic candidates to the news channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided over whom to believe in in the wake of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with a small majority in favor of the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41% of those surveyed were fully or fairly convinced of Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they were fully or fairly convinced of Kavanaugh’s presentation.
In addition, 38% said that they were fairly or completely convinced that Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while only 30% said the same thing about Ford.
Following the release of Flake, the FBI is investigating the claims made by Ford in addition to at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford explained to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh was in a state of drunken abuse at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party at Yale in the 1980s.
The author of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, author of the World Wide Web, launches a launch to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
On Solid, users can choose where their data should be stored and which persons access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked about the purpose of ‘world dominance’.
‘We have to do it now’, he said about the start-up.
‘It is a historic moment.’
The app uses the technology for Solid to allow people to create their own "personal repository online" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, work lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about the personal repository online is that it's entirely up to the user who should have access to that kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal disclosure through data’.
The idea of the Inrupt is according to the company CEO, John Bruce, to provide the company with resources, process and relevant competence to make Solid available to all.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on the project and a bunch of volunteer programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about introducing something completely new or not, which will completely transform their business models overnight.
“We do not ask your permission.”
In an article on the Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee turned the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the debate over cyber-neutrality.
Even if he launches Inrut, Berners-Lee will still be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
‘I am incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Web,’ added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water, celebration of the Victoria Cross receiver of World War I.
The only clergyman in the English church assigned to a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Water was awarded honors on September 29, 1918, at the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A memorial stone was uncovered by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Water, said there was a great symbolism in the discovery of the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Water led his battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29th, “through very thick fog and under heavy fire from field cannons and machine guns”.
Later, he plunged toward the line of fire and led the line “of great courage” forward before storming a field cannon with his own hands and knocking out three of the wards.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to, but something that humbles me. ”
He and his brother, Dr. James Water, also put down a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Corps.
Michael Vann said, "I felt very honored to play a part in the parade," and added, "The glory of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night watching the martial arts program Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you have stayed awake all night to see the packed Bellator 206, only to discover that you will not see the main event.
The participant from San Jose survived 13 games, including six on the main card and was shown directly through the night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6: 00 a.m., while Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, Britain’s viewers were sitting when the picture suddenly showed Peppa pig.
Some were less impressed after staying awake until early morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the transition to the children’s program as “a sort of sick joke. ”
‘It is state regulations that it is not appropriate to send such programs at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to the children's program,’ said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president for marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppy pig, yes!"
Bellator's CEO, Scott Coker, said they're going to be working on the transmission schedule to include the viewers in Great Britain in the future.
“I think we can figure it out for the rematch, ” said Coker.
“ But it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there, and we will not be able to resolve this until Sunday, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Faith--when we transferred, a lot of messages went back and forth, and they weren't exactly the friendly kind.
We tried to solve it and thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't. It was a government thing.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce from six to five games — which we usually send — and we tried to reach far for the fans but tipped over.
It’s an unfortunate situation”.
Desert Island Discs, Tom Daley felt inferior to sexuality.
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality — but that gave him the motivation he needed to succeed.
The 24-year-old says it wasn't until junior high he realized that "he wasn't like other kids".
In the first show Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he stood up for gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that parenthood made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The usual program director, Kirsty Young, is reported to be missing a few months from illness.
Daley seemed a little lost on Laverne's first broadcast and said he felt ‘less worth’ than everyone else he grew up with because ‘it was not socially acceptable to like both boys and girls’.
He said, “To-day, these feelings of being inferior and different have been the real motivation and have the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was somebody, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
He's twice a bronze winner in the Olympics and has become a high-profile LGBT ambassador, who used his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he comes forward because he feels he's lucky to live openly without any negative consequences and wants to give others hope.
The three times the world champion said that his falling in love with a man - filmmaker Dustin Lance Black from the United States, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he attended his first Olympics at age 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said "all perspective" his had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I had to do was win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than gold medals in the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after having been diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had obtained tickets to London, 2012 — since he wanted to sit in the front row.
'I could not tell him that he would not live long enough to sit in the front row,' he said.
‘I held his hands when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized that he was not invincible, ’ he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronco.
“I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — diving in front of a home audience during the Olympics, the best feeling ever, ” he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small — which meant a lot to him in the pre - Olympic run and still gives him goose bumps.
The Desert Island Discs go on BBC Radio 4 Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Form weak Mickelson took out for the Ryder Cup golf tournament on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he's gonna have to get in shape if it's not gonna be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who plays in the Biennia for an impressive 12th time, was benched by Team Captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he had so often been to the United States, it divides five times the major-winning day between being cheerleader and working on its game on rank, hoping to correct what's wrong.
The 48-year-old never had the best swing, even on top of his career, and he's not in the perfect shape for the tight Le Golf National track, where the long rough area is always punishing the wrong kind.
And if the field itself isn't frightening enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, the British Open-Master Francesco Molinari, who's joined the rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, with four points down before the 12 singles, get off to a successful start, Mickelson's game could turn out to be crucial.
Furyk expresses confidence in his husband, not that he could have said otherwise.
‘He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready the next day, ’ said Furyk.
“ He has a lot of confidence.
He is a Hall of Famer and has added so much to these layers in the past, and this week.
I don't think I imagined him playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it ended, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everybody else."
Mickelson wants to beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that's never quite reached his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 losses and seven draw, but Furyk said his participation added some intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, and likes to make fun of others; he’s a great guy to keep in the living room, ” he explained.
“ I think the younger players had a good time hitting on him this week, too, and it was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just the game."
European captain Thomas Bjørn knows that his great leadership may soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a significant lead at the entrance of the last day’s single game in Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant round.
The Danish debuted in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where one side led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but drew the victory by the least margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won but barely”, Bjorn said, photographed after seeing Class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday leading 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You'll give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you get your scores on the board.
We have one goal, and that's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus lies.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are very aware of what is on the other side — the best golfers in the world.’
Bjørn is delighted with how his players have managed on the tough golf course and adds: “I couldn’t have done better.
Tomorrow is a new challenge.
Tomorrow, the individual achievements are the center of attention, and that's a whole other thing.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there alone, your performance as a golfer will be tested to the full.
It's the message that you have to pass on to the players, that they have to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he's got to go out and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjørn, his opponent Jim Furyk will try to make his players perform better individually than they did as partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three out of four points.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great upheaval last day. He was on the winning team at Brookline before he ended up a loser when Europe performed the Miracle of Medinah.
I remember every damn word of it," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, had ravaged his players at the entrance to the last day.
“ We have 12 important games tomorrow, but one would like to get off to a good start, like the one we saw at Brookline, which we saw at Medinah.
When the momentum starts to run in one direction, it puts great pressure on the middle games.
We'll arrange our setup then and send out the people in the way we feel about it, you know, we'll try to create something magical tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and challenge Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter like the other Europeans in the upper half of the game order.
"I'm betting on this group of men in that order because I think it'll stand all the way," said Bjorn about his choice of single players.
Germany’s new warships delayed again
German Navy’s newest frigate should have been completed in 2014 to replace ancient warships from the Cold War days, but it will not be until the earliest next year because of failing systems and galloping costs, the local media reported.
The completion of ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’, the pilot ship of the brand-new frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesperson.
The ship was supposed to have been handed over to the Navy in 2014, but the major problems after delivery were in pursuit of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg Navy ordered all the way back in 2007, will replace the old Bremen class frigates.
It is agreed that they should be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles and some stealth technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods — it should be possible to apply the most recent frigates for up to two years away from home port.
Constant delays, however, mean that the advanced warships — they were said to strengthen Germany at sea — will already be obsolete by the time they are put into service, reports Die Zeit.
The fateful F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the tournament, but the German media mentioned a number of important “software and hardware defects” that rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software defects were of particular importance since vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also revealed that the ship has enormous obesity, which reduces performance and limits the marine ability to perform upgrades in the future.
The 7,000-ton heavy Rheinland-Pfalz is estimated to be twice as heavy as similar ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project — including crew training — has begun to become a problem.
It is claimed to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros — from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems surrounding the new frigates are particularly significant in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval force is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, director of the German Government's Defense Committee, confirmed that the Navy is actually running out of usable ships.
The official said that the problem has escalated over time because old ships had been removed, but no new vessels arrived.
He's sorry that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be used by the Navy.
National Trust eavesdropping on bats ’ secret lives
New research carried out on land in the highlands of Scotland is designed to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
There is hope that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help design future conservation measures.
The study of scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and dwarf bats as well as brown - long ears and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be posted at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also perform mobile investigations using hand-held detectors.
Experts' sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and the species that do what.
Next, a habitat map and a report will be prepared to produce a detailed landscape view of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will be part of the decision on the measures to be taken, such as the establishment of pasture grounds and how best to preserve the forest for bats and other associated species.
The Bat population in Scotland and Britain has dropped considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and construction that influence breeding sites and the curbing of habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose risks, as can flypaper and certain chemically treated building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats, in fact, are not blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, they have more use for their ears than their eyes for catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation to locate insects and obstacles on the road when flying.
NTS, responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, bats take very seriously.
They have ten skilled experts who regularly do research, mapping of breeding sites, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at Threeave land property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
“ Here at Threeave we have the perfect area for bats, ” he says.
“ We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and the ideal habitat.
But there is still much we do not know about bats, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us to understand more about what they need to thrive.’
He emphasizes the importance of surveying bats before maintenance is carried out on a property since accidental destruction of a single breeding site can kill up to 400 females and young and may destroy an entire local population.
Bats are protected, and it is illegal to kill them, harass them, disturb them, or destroy their breeding sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish associate of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help out in their work.
She says: “We still have much to learn about our bats, and for many of the species, we simply do not know how the populations survive. ”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges while lawyers want to sue German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as “false news ” and said that people want fame by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The attacker for Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's been accused of paying her $375,000 in hindsight to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
When he spoke on a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers a few hours after the charges were reported, 33 - year - old Ronaldo rejected the charges as “false news. ”
'No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news, says five times the winner of Goldball into the camera.
“They want fame by using my name.
It's common.
They want fame by giving up my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right, ’ adds the football player with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the claims, which they have called “an unacceptable representation of suspicions in the private sphere, ” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the football player will claim compensation for ‘injury to the extent of the severity of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years’.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino, Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the soccer player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents presented to the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99% a good person” who was betrayed by the “one percent”.
The documents show that Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later they settled outside the court because she was “scared to death for revenge” and was also concerned about becoming“publicly dependent”.
The 34-year-old says she's now trying to put the settlement aside because she's still traumatized after the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer to Italian Juventus on a 100 million euro contract.
Brexit: Britain “will mourn forever” over the loss of car manufacturers
Britain “will mourn forever” if they lose their world-leading status in car production after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was “anxious” that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delayed border crossing at any uncontracted Brexit could mean fewer jobs.
The Burnaston plant – producing Toyotas Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
‘If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory stop,’ said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other British producers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how trade across borders will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're gonna shut down the Mini factory at Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car manufacturers say is the supply chain risks of any uncontracted Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on the basis of ‘order as needed’, and parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars designed to order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, it may be delayed at the border, which industry says can lead to delays and lack of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production will stop.
Clark said that the Theresa Mays Brexit plan for further relations with the EU is ‘presist designed to avoid such checks at the border’.
"We need a deal, and we want to get the best deal that makes us, as I say, not just enjoy the moment, but take this opportunity," he said on the BBC Radio 4's Today.
‘The company, not only from Toyota but also from other car manufacturers, is that we must be able to carry on what has been a very successful set of supply chains’.
Toyota could not tell how long production will be stopped but warned that increased costs in the long term will reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually result in loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trade union manager at the factory, said that members are increasingly concerned: “My experience suggests that when these jobs disappear, they will never come back.
A government spokesperson said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU"
Trump’s encounter with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House
Donald Trump’s fateful encounter with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein may be “at the end of another week” while the battle of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House reported on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, investigating Russian involvement in the election, connections between Trump aides and Russia, as well as possible obstruction of prosecution by the president.
The issue of Trump will dismiss the vice minister of justice or not, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has lingered for many months in the speculations of Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of recording conversations with Trump and trying to remove the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last month he went to the White House, while it was reported that he was about to resign voluntarily.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting with Trump, then at the U.N. in New York City, would take place Thursday.
Trump said he would “preferably avoid ” firing Rosenstein, but then the meeting was exposed to avoid collision with the Senate Judiciary Committee where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both Witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI investigation in one week regarding charges against Kavanaugh, which further postponed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, attended Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There was no set date for the meeting, and it could be this week, but I realized it could be a week's respite because of everything that happens to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm always interested in keeping the press up-to-date."
Some journalists will challenge that claim: Sanders hasn't held a press conference in the White House since September 10th.
Program host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to TV reporting, even though she added, “I do not disagree with their smugness”.
Then she indicated that contact between Trump and the press would be more frequent.
‘The President is doing more questions than any previous president’, she said and added without any evidence: ‘We have looked at the figures’.
Sanders said there will still be press conferences, but “if the press gets a chance to question the President of the United States directly, it will certainly be better than talking to me.
We're trying to make it happen a lot, and you've seen that we've done it a lot in the last few weeks, and that's going to replace a press conference when you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences when important people visit.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York City this week, the president showed the possible cause when he ran a solo race and at times behaved strangely in front of a multitude of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland regarding Brexit concerns
The Secretary of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain was to leave the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to cover the costs of applying for a residence and employment permit for EU citizens working in their public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “Conventions between the United Kingdom and the EU about releases have taken place during the summer and are expected to land on a solution in the fall.
But the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible scenario without an agreement.
I understand that this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
So I would now like to repeat how much I value the efforts of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU, and outside, provide valuable experiences and competences that strengthen and improve the health care work for the benefit of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes urgent surgery after head injury
Defense team at the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent urgent surgery after a head injury during Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ in the newspaper Tennessean.
Tennessee States' main coach, Rod Reed, told the reporters that the damage was done just before the first quarter was over.
"He came out on the sidelines and sort of collapsed there," said Reed.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sidelines before they put him on a stretcher and took him back for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris from WSMV, Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no information is available on the type/recovery of the damage yet” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, is entering his first season of Tennessee State after crossing from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he ended the fight, resulting in a total of 18 tackles for his season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when purchasing property in the United Kingdom.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn's plan to attract young voters.
The increase in document taxes will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
Experts in the Ministry of Finance expect it to increase to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May today will announce that foreign buyers will be charged a higher document fee when they buy property in Britain — and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The program will be considered an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s plan to attract young people with the promise to offer cheaper housing and high - income groups.
The tax increase will be imposed on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in Britain, and the extra money will strengthen government efforts to remedy the homeless situation.
The excess — which is in addition to the applicable document fee, including the higher rate introduced two years ago at the second dwelling and the rental purchases — can be as much as 3 %.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 % of newly built properties in London are purchased by persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, which drives prices up and makes it harder for first buyers to get their foot inside the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country — especially in the capital — have become “ghost cities ” because of the many foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a reduction in document fees to help several young people own their own homes.
He charged large construction firms with keeping housing prices high by purchasing land without using it, demanding Theresa May to reject allowances on reasonable housing to solve Britain’s “smear housing policy”.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a startling array of proposed housing reformers, including rental controls and an end to unfounded evictions.
He also wants to give city officials greater power to build new housing.
May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream — that life should be better for each new generation.
And that means finding solutions for our broken-down housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and make a life here.
However, it cannot be as simple for people not living in Britain, as well as foreign - based corporations, to buy homes as it is for hardworking British citizens.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the undignified situation of the homeless persists.’
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead Scotland."
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "final goal" is to become Scotland's manager sooner or later.
The 42 - year - old Scotsman delights in the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which currently holds third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
“ I wanted to play for my country as a football player.
I got a B-caps and that's it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
“ But I spent a lot of time with my father and saw Scotland on Hampden as a child, and there is always something that pulls me back.
However, that possibility would only come if I succeeded in the club management’.
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic chief says he wasn't afraid to follow such established names in the big club, and has previously refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
‘Success for me at the moment will be measured on whether I can get the club back in the Premier League’.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, they undoubtedly belong to the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably just consider myself successful here if I get the club back there."
Ross has only been in charge for three years, after a period as Assistant Chief of Dambarton and a 15-month short performance in Hearts' Coach Staff.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the Third Division and helped St Mirren from the brink of decline to win the championship next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalls when he took over the leadership of Alloa.
“ I really thought that guidance was right for me, more right than playing.
It sounds strange because I did well, made a reasonable income from it, and experienced some fine highlights.
But football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you need to get through on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through it with the stress and pressure of my job, but management feels right to me.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, and it feels like the most comfortable thing I've ever felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint to be at 5:30 on Saturdays, according to a survey.
The summer heat wave has strengthened the revenue of Britain’s hard - pressed pubs, but it put more pressure on the restaurant chains.
Pubers and bars experienced a 2.7 % increase in sales in July – while restaurant income fell 4.8 %, the figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant CGA, who summarized the figures, said: “Still sunshine and England’s unexpected long participation in World Cup followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month of June, when pubs rose 2.8%, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8% fall in June restaurant sales only got worse in July.
Drinking-based pubs and bars had the very best outcome, but an increase that was more equal than what restaurants went down.
Pubes with food service also had a hard time with the sun, although it was not as dramatic as it was for the Rastaurant Drivers.
It seemed like people just wanted to go out and drink.
For chain-based pubs and bars, sales increased by 6.6% that month, with food-serving decreasing 3%’.
Paul Newman, an analyst from the hotel and restaurant industry RSM, stated: “These results follow the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and large sporting and social events are still the most important factors in out-of-market sales.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups are still struggling, and a drop in sales of 4.8% year-on-year will be particularly painful at the top of the current cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food service companies, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will give us a long breathing space".
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including openings, was 2.7 % in July, reflecting the braking rate in roll-out of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, industry turnover inspector for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses the results of 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of 9 billion pounds, and is the established industry standard.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children — some only 11 years of age — has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers shows research
A study of 20,000 junior high school students revealed ‘fake Insta’ pages.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a ‘principal account’ that they show their parents.
One child in five — some only 11 years of age — sets up social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A study of 20,000 junior high school students revealed a rapid growth in fake Insta accounts – a reference to image sharing pages on Instagram.
The news has raised concerns about the sharing of sexual content.
20% of the students said they had an innocent ‘principal account’ that they refer to their parents, while they have other secret accounts.
A mother who came across the secret page of her 13 - year - old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “violate me. ”
Research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of private schools revealed that 40% of 11 to 18-year-old students had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's frightening that so many young people are tempted to set up websites where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilith Doyle will be the voice of track athletes in Scottish Athleticsboard
Eilith Doyle has been elected chairman of Scottish Athletics and has a non-executive role in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the incident as a good opportunity for those who direct her sport to gain insight into her extensive international experience during the past ten years.
“Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, British, and worldwide track environment, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland will benefit from getting her into the board of directors, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am anxious to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I have a lot to contribute to guide the sport in Scotland. ”
The American won 200 and 400 meters at the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 and has a total of four Olympic golds, and she's now a regular BBC expert, and after she had a transient ischaemic attack, she couldn't walk.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago today I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if I want to recover and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I'm fine and I've learned to walk again, and today I'm doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging news."
Breast pump ads comparing mothers to cows split public on the web
A breast - pump company has divided online public opinion with an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to cows that are milked.
In order to mark the launch of what is said to be the world’s first soundless breast pump carried close to the body, Elvie published a technology-based company for consumer goods, a healthy and flirtatious music video-inspired advertisement to show freedom the new pump provides active mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows to a tune with the following words: “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “In case you didn’t understand, these aren’t yurts, these are my boobs”.
The choir will say, "Pump it out, pump it out, I will feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I will milk my buns."
However, the advertisement, published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a storm on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has had mixed reactions from the viewers, many say it judiciary in the dairy industry.
‘Very bad decision to use cows to advertise for this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them a few days after birth, ” wrote one.
Elvie breast pump fits well into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Openly traumatic for both mother and baby.
Why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another added: ‘For a failed ad’.
Others defend the ad, and a woman admitted that she thinks the song is “unbelievably funny”.
“ I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I was still nursing.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product", someone wrote.
Another commented: ‘This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who pump (often at work or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that hails or condemns the dairy business.’
At the end of the video, the women have revealed that they have all danced with the discreet pump in the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump themselves say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely stationary, has no wires or hoses, and gets fine space in a breast-feeding bra, so that women get the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD of Mother, commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing parallels between active women and dairy cows, we wanted to put a spotlight on breast pumping and all the challenges, while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and recognizable way the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump provides.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a two - child mother appeared on the catwalk for designing Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved to a camp on the Texas border in secret
The number of detained migrant children has risen despite the relative stability of the monthly border crossing, partly because severe rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to place children in support players.
Traditionally, most supporters themselves have been undocumented immigrants and have been afraid to ruin their own chances of staying in the country by coming forward and claiming a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adults in the household had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Immigration and Customs Department, testified to Congress that the bureau had arrested dozens of people who applied to be a sidekick for single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrests had no prior criminal record.
‘Almost 80 % of the persons who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal immigrants.
So we keep stalking these people, says Albence.
The officers try to handle the children faster and introduced new rules that indicate that some of them must appear in court within one month after being detained, rather than 60 days that were the previous standard, according to reception workers.
Many will be presented through video conferences rather than appear personally in order to conduct an immigration judge’s case.
Those considered to be unjustified asylum seekers will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in custody, the greater the risk of anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escapes, according to reception workers and reports made during the recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns have grown at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where children who struggle are more easily overlooked because of their size.
They added that moving children to the camp without sufficient time to prepare emotionally or to say good - bye to friends can intensify trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria asks American, French and Turkish “occupation powers” to withdraw immediately.
In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also acting as vice - prime minister, said that the foreign forces were trespassing on Syrian soil under the guise of combating terrorism and “will be treated accordingly”.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the audience.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions are on the run.
He said that Damascus will continue "to wage this holy fight until we have purged all Syrian territories" for both terrorist groups and "all foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for the training and counselling of Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are so good that they can return, and he charged “certain Western countries” with “repress irrational flight” that keeps the refugees away.
“We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these re-enterings, ” he said.
They police what is really a purely humanitarian situation.’
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no support for rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major defense position of the rebels at Idlib has created an opportunity to push for political conversation.
The Russian/Turkian agreement averted a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces against the province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had ‘clear deadlines’ and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against Jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaeda-related Nusra Front, who will ‘be exterminated’.
United Nations Emissary Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of state and oppositional members to prepare a postwar capital law for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian authorities to participate in the Committee and stated that the work of the panel should be limited to ‘the review of the articles of the present Constitution’ and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win another period?
By that logic, Trump would have won reelection in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, impeachment and scandal put an end to the presidency before that.
In what would surely be the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!
At the moment, there's no sign of acquiescence.
Since 2014, best-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen.
"This is a fire that attracts people because we don't understand anything," said Neal Baer, program director of the ABC drama, "Designed Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a renowned comedy creator and author of the "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was voting for Trump.
Why?
He said, “Because he makes me laugh.”
There's an entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the actions that unfold in Washington can determine the future of abortion rights, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Discharge is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you go to great lengths to be an enlightened person when you stay seated for six hours to follow a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of “deep dive in background material” for the book “Fear”, Paul Manafort’s leather jacket with ostrich feathers worth $15,000 (“an item blubbered with hybris”), said the Washington Post) and the consequences of Stormy Daniel’s colorful descriptions of Trumps, er..., anatomy.
At least I don't want to look at Super Mario the same way anymore.
"One of the things he does that makes it look like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, the Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the Creator of the Pawnee Stars, about Trump's varying cast and daily twist on the plot (contact with the NFL, shamerose Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss one episode, or you'll fall behind.
When I met Fleiss this week, there were 27 °C and the sun outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, Hawaii, but he locked himself up and watched MSNBC as he recorded CNN.
He couldn't break free, not when Brett Kavanaugh is facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the U.S. Supreme Court is at stake.
"I remember when we made all the crazy programs in the old days and people said this is the end of Western civilization," told Fleiss.
'I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right.'

Outside money flows into the common middle elections of the House of Representatives
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th district experiences a flow of money after a conversion of a congressional district that ended with two sitting representatives fighting for the same seat.
This newly acquired suburban district in Pittsburg is running with the Democratic representative Conor Lamb — who won his seat in another district in a supplement election last spring.
Lamb is running against another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which greatly overlaps the new 17th.
The map was pulled up again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional manipulation of the voting circuits in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th district has led to an explosive race for campaign finance between the major party finance groups, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republic Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in a closely followed supplement election for the 18th district of Pennsylvania to Congress last March.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a small leadership.
The United States considered criminal action against El Salvador for support to China, then withdrew the threat
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a hearty meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the lead team of the Trump Organization.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to recall the U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, Dominican Republic, and Panama because of “the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore, ” said Heather Nauert, the minister’s spokesperson, in an opinion earlier this month.
However, penalties were assessed only against El Salvador, who received an estimated 140 million dollars in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug controls, development, and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials postponed a top - level conference that focused on security and economic growth to follow up a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward in the attempt to prevent migrants from coming to the United States.
By mid - September, however, officials of the Supreme Administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending all plans for criminal action against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is now scheduled in the middle of October, to show the importance the administration attaches to the collection, the diplomat said.
And the three U.S. envoys calmly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or criminal action from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations subject to anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn From History
The next nail in the coffin may be Special Adviser Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, as is now very solid evidence in public documents.
Mueller is allegedly also expanding his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in our elections.
If Congress were to change sides, Trump would be held accountable in that body, in the middle of preparing to meet the voters again and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertain factors, and I don’t mean to say that Trump’s downfall is inevitable — nor for his counterparts in Europe.
There must be a choice of all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the battle will last.
In 1938 German officers stood ready to make a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and supported the Czechoslovaks of Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such tipping points, and the inexorable March of democracy is accelerated or hampered.
The Americans are facing several of these tips now.
What will we do if Trump kicks Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a lot of trouble since this paper reported that last year he proposed secret presidential ballots and speculated that he was unfit to be president.
Rosenstein says that The Times' production is incorrect.
‘How will we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair — or if he is approved to the Supreme Court in spite of credible abuse charges and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote on the midterm of a Congress that will put Trump in charge?
If we fail those tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we'll fail because of the experience I gained in Prague.
My mother was a Chescoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me off to light the sabbatical on the table with the swastika.
With such an inheritance, how can I not look on our future with optimism?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians after the impressive draw fight in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a strong position to qualify from group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented Midfield player Graham Dorrans from making his first performance for the season of the draw fight 2-2 against Villarreal, but he thinks the Rangers can use the results as a stepping stone to make bigger things happen.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We entered the game and thought we could do something and got one point with us.
Maybe we could've nodded in at the end, but a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first place, and we got out in the second place and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big night in Europe.
We're hoping for three points, but it'll be hard because they had a good result in the last game, but with a home audience in the back, I'm sure we can stand on it and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely rough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the replacements in the club itself, but there's a good feeling now.
The team's good and the boys are having a good time; the training's good.
Hopefully we can get on with it now, put the last season behind us and make it happen."
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to the family about it.
About half the people in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10% said they talked to the kids about it.
‘People want to be taken care of by family members, but they do nothing to make that conversation, ’ said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless you say what you want in advance.
Discuss with the counselor and the family where and how care is to be given, for such choices can make a big difference in determining costs.
Include your financial adviser: The counselor can also help you to figure out how to pay for expenses.
The financial options for long-term care may include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses or self-assurance with your own assets — if you have enough money.
Work out your legal documents, clear out legal problems right away.
Get a health authorisation in place by appointing a person you trust to keep track of your medical care and making sure that if you are prevented from communicating, health care workers will comply with your wishes.
You should also consider giving someone authority over your finances.
You choose a trustworthy person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you cannot do so yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aged parents are in a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write out the details of a chart so that you are prepared.
'It is not only the finances that are at stake, who are the doctors' said Martin.
“ What drugs do you need?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep that chart in place’.

Indonesia’s Earthquakes and tsunamis
At least 384 persons have been killed in a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communication is down, and rescue workers have not been able to get information from Donggala Regentship, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are a few key facts about the Palu and Donggala island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of central Sulawesi, at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that stretches along more than 200 miles [300 km] of coastline in northwest Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region below the province level, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the girders of the central province of Sulawesi’s economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the shores of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s relief administration.
In 1938 a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also met West Donggala in 1996 and killed nine people.
Indonesia is on the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh Province north of Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 magnitude hit the south of Java, Indonesia’s most populated island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the south coast.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 magnitude occurred near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumartra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude struck one of the Mentawai Islands, outside Sumatra, and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the government of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing havoc and panic as men were reminded of the devastating effects of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but over 100 were killed by converging buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes strike Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok and kill more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of a former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested following sexual assault charges.
Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with a home violence report, and resisting arrest, according to a report published Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he reportedly picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the alleged assault.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention prison and arrested for an unsecured $500 bond, reported the KTU.
He was brought before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself “not guilty, absolutely” when asked how he was dealing with the guilt issue, the network reported.
Palin confronts three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time there's been a charge against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of molestation against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is being taken in Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, arguing with the report of domestic violence, and holding a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after she served in Iraq.
Indonesia Earthquake Tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck near central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media videos are circulating that show the outbreak.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami slammed on the beach.
Federal prosecutors rarely seek the death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City who killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been committed in the state of a federal crime since 1953.
Apparently, Saipov, 30 years old, used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecution must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "consequently" and intentionally caused serious bodily injuries, as indicated by the intention to apply for capital punishment in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these items qualify for the possible death penalty, pursuant to the file.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury dropped the 22-point charge, including eight counts of extortion murder, to Saipov's face, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and vehicle wrecking.
The attack called for "significant planning and intent," said the prosecutor, who described the way Saipov carried it out as "glorious, cruel and corrupt".
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused personal injuries, properties and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, determines the warning of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a capital case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York City, in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to the legal documents.
He told the investigators that he was happy for what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his cell phone, according to the charge.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He did not plead guilty on 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the publicly appointed defenders of Saipov, said they were “apparently disappointed ” by the prosecution’s decision.
‘We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept a confession and life in prison without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,’ said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL DANGERAGE should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a demonstration at the Tory Conference.
The former UKip leader said that the politicians would get "felt" from the European skeptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the demonstrators in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "would have been wiped out" by now if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for May in reconciling his deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by the pro-Remain Tories who took part in a demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his Brexit plan on the trail of Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Her supporters insisted that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setback — and force European skeptics and Labour to choose between her package and "caos".
Bone told 'Emission means release' the protesters in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Brexit plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been made a member and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I want to go on for Brexit, but we have to reject the Brexit plan”.
When explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in two world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The claim that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely wrong’.
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the demonstration and told reporters: “I simply say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Brexit plan is unpopular with the public, and the opposition won't vote for it, and it's unpopular with the party and with our activists, who are actually the ones who trudge the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Discard the Brexit plan and start listening’.
In a direct message to May, she added: “State Ministers keep the job when they keep their promises”.
Farage stated that politicians would get the "felt" if they thought about betraying the decision made at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now about the trust between us, the people, and the politicians," he said.
‘They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to let them know that they will not get away with it.’
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to let our politicians, who are on the tip to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.'
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before they had a two - hour political gathering in the center of the city.
A small amount of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.
Labour member Lord Adonis taunted the conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app as the conference began.
‘These are the people who tell us that they can have their IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, plus, for a friction-free limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland’, he added.
He said, "It is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider seriously running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat was talking about the future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against Republican representative Geoff Diehl, vice president of the Trumps Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
She's been central to speculation if she's going to run against Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with electoral officials, who have been using the town hall format since Trump became president.
A contestant asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time for “women to get to Washington to fix our defective government, and that includes a woman at the top. ”
The arrest after Sims of LSU was killed by gunfire
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at an 11 o'clock news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was spotted on the video.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed near campus at Southern University early Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result, ” reported Chief Murphy J. Paul to the media on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was on the scene carrying a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without excitement and placed in custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a six-foot kid who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games with 10 starting last season, his average was 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 returns per game.
Russian Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton targets the world championship after the stable order gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' stable order would play a major role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas got off to a good start and swept Hamilton off the field as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove into the depot first and allowed Hamilton to continue driving in the back of the main field, which should have been crucial.
Mercedes did a pit stop later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton drove up after some pushing with the wheels that made the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free after a double pass to defend himself in the third turn.
Max Verstapp started from the back row of the field and came in as number seven at the end of the first round of his 21st birthday.
Then he led in much of the race as he lay on the wheels to try to get a quick finish and overpower Kimi Raikgonen as number four.
Finally, he came to the 44th round depot, but he could not speed up the remaining eight rounds and the Raikgon took fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a wonderful job all weekend and was a proper gentleman who was told to let me through.
The team's done a great job getting a good pair of hands, Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at a political event on Saturday for insisting that she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president spoke at an event in West Virginia, he did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee, but he commented that what was going on in the Senate shows that people are "obscene, cruel and untrue."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you're experiencing the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and cruel and speaking untrue," he said.
'When you look at extraditions and leaks, they say, 'Oh, I have not done it.
I did not do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, oh, what?"
Oh, no.
I have not leaked."
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added, with an imitation of the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter with detailed information about the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak coming from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But her denial was not taken up graciously by the president, who at the party event Saturday night commented, "I'll tell you one thing, that was a really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
In his continued defense of the Supreme Court’s candidate, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats used the claims for their own purposes.
They have decided to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the madness, the evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get the power and control, the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer brought in two targets for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League losses against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
Early on, the Giants received a two-target command via gunfire from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillener.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie offset the home team before Dwyer restored the head of the Giants.
Francois Bouchard was equal to Dundee before two measures of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
That was the third Elite League loss for the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come on the back after they beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the third meeting of the season between the teams, and the Giants had won the three previous games.
Dwyer’s opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford posted the game when Beauviller doubled his lead four minutes later.
In what became a hectic opening period, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquartt set off for Cownie’s equalization at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants were in charge on a break when he took his second goal for the evening at the end of the first round.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched with a masterful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the late second game, and he secured the victory with the team's five half out in the final round.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die to ensure that hundreds of air passengers escape earthquakes
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as after he died and ensured that an airplane with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
More than 800 people have died, and many are missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue to terrorize the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Even after the colleagues had fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, who was on the runway just then, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reports Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to move him to a major hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts broke when we heard it," he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll may reach thousands, and the country’s emergency agency reports limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
‘The numbers are expected to rise further since many bodies are still trapped under the ruins and many have not been reachable’, said the spokesman for the body, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Up to 20 - foot (6 m) - high waves have destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, explained to Sky News: “All the time, ambulances are being seen picking up casualties.
There's a shortage of clean water.
Minimarkets are being robbed everywhere’.
Jan Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working frantically to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
On Sunday, Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to perform all the duties of the evacuation.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was struck by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok, where over 550 people died.
Air Niugini now reports that a man is missing after planes crashed in lagoons.
The airline that owned the plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific in Micronesia now says that one man is missing, reporting earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini, in a press release, said that on Saturday afternoon there was one male passenger they had no record of.
The airline said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for further details about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospitals.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were stable.
What led to the crash and the precise sequence of events is still unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just outside the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to wade through waist - deep water to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said that the stewards were panicking and screaming and that he suffered a minor head injury.
U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to repair a dock also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet [30 m] below water level.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in crashes with PNG registered aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them involved Air Niugini.
Analyst sets out the timeline for the night a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution closed the procedure Saturday in a new trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell records to puzzle the movements of 29 - year - old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19 - year - old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same place as Chambers' phone during the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went on the stand Saturday claiming he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford's trailer that night, Sanford said that he was "lookin' out because my trailer was in Nashville."
Another disagreement was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a little after Chambers' death, Telli's call erased, contact details and messages to and from Chambers from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its procedure on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is society - minded hip hop?
A hip hop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling the music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved from its origins with political messages to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make society-enhanced hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a new resurgence in Britain through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York child-sitter sues couples for dismissal after the "racist" message.
A New York child care worker sues a couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving an error message from her mother, who complained that she was “another black person”.
The couple reject their racial bias and compare the lawsuit to ‘expression’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up for her first work day in 2016.
‘NEEEEL ENDA A BLACK PERSON’, Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband in a message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After discovering the mistake, it was a "Uco-Flaxman" Plasco-Flaxman who quit Maurice by claiming that their fired nanny, who was African American, had done a poor job and that she had expected someone from the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for his one working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for their resignation and claims compensation in the amount of $350 a day for the six - month, room - based arrangement she was promised, but without contract.
"I wanted to show them that, hey, you just don't do this," she said to the New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know that's discrimination."
The couple have retaliated against the charges that they are rastic and say Maurice’s dismissal was the only thing right, since they did not feel they could trust her after insulting her.
"My wife sent her something she had not intended to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, the man said Joel Plasco to the New York Post.
“ But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a misunderstanding?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
The comparison of the lawsuit with ‘expression’ says Plasco was due to his wife’s having only two months to term and being in a ‘very difficult situation’.
'Is this the kind of person you wish to punish?
It is not very nice’, added the stockbroker.
While the legal case is running its course, the people’s court has been quick to condemn the couple on social media and criticize them for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington’s publisher feared that readers would not accept a talking bear, revealing another letter
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It is difficult to put oneself in the place of others when reading it for the first time before it was published.
It's very funny to know what we now know about Paddington's great success."
She says her father, who had worked as a cameraman in the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book by a little cloth bear, would have been very pleased that his work had been turned down, adding that the 60th anniversary of his book release was "bitterly" after he passed away last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important family member ” and adds that her father secretly was very proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not a boastful person," she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as when you have a child who makes an accomplishment: you are proud of it even though it is not really your fault.
I think he kind of looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his product and his imagination, he always used to give credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say it looked bad, that he didn’t think she would survive, ” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“ Then I got the call from Nad saying she would die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicine the doctors had given her to make her heart beat slowly lost its effect and left the system.
She died a while before and the organs of her body collapsed.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing it happened.
I couldn’t scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to pull myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers — who did not know about the trials she was undergoing.
"Nobody knew," she says.
'I looked down all the time, and tears ran in a steady stream.
It's hard to explain, but it was there on the plane that I felt this overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up postcards on a bridge in Wales with encouraging messages and phone numbers for help.
Sharon’s son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parents to experience what I have to relive every day, ” she says.
Forty - five - year - old Sharon, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everyone recognized him by his smile.
They said his smile could light up any room."
He quit his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was one of those who found him after he killed himself.
Sharon says, "I am constantly concerned that there will be an infectious effect."
Sharon made the cards, "To tell people there are people out there to go to and talk to, even if it is just a friend.
Don't sit down - you need to talk to someone".
Kelly, who has been Sharon’s friend for many years, soon after his mother’s death, Mark, his partner, lost his 15 - year - old partner.
“He didn’t tell me he was feeling down or depressed or anything, ” she says.
“ A few days before Christmas, we noticed the altered mood.
On Christmas Day, he was all the way in the basement — when the kids opened Christmas presents, they didn’t make eye contact or anything.’
She says his death was a great trauma to them, but they have to fight through it, saying, "It tears up a big hole in the family.
It'll tear us apart.
But we must all endure and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance while the FBI starts investigating.
‘I thought that if we could achieve some of the things he asked for — a time-limited and large-scale investigation — we might come to some agreement,’ Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee was ‘decommissioned’ along firmly fixed party boundaries.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
The resentment was due to the timing.
The midterms are only five weeks away, November 6 — if the Republicans supposedly do poorly, it will be significantly harder for them to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush has been calling senators and lobbying to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and met his wife Ashley there when she was the personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sitting at the moment.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate so that Vice President Mike Pence can use his double vote and put him on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'faller' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, stated a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which refers to data from the South Korean Collection Department, said there had been 1,127 defections last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park stated that stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices for human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang hasn't publicly commented on it.
Most defectors from North Korea are eventually offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Korean states.
China views defectors as illegal migrants, not refugees, and returns them by force.
The relationship between the North and the South — which is technically still at war — has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries of Pyongyang met for conversations about the closed negotiations on denuclearization.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they decided to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the United States' sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no possibility that we will arm ourselves unilaterally first,” said Ri in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court Canadian Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he had a temper that made him unfit to sit on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help but think that if a woman had acted this way, she would have been called hysterical," said Pelosi regarding her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied feeling that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, sometimes he almost cried out and was sobbing when he spoke about his family and the years in high school.
He was also strongly condemning the Democratic Committee and called the allegations against him a "grote and coordinated crime of character" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't sit on the Supreme Court because it shows that he's prejudiced against Democrats.
"I believe he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was approved and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
‘I will say this — if he does not tell the truth to Congress and the FBI, he is not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court but also in the court in which he is now sitting, ’ said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) or Roe v. Wade (abortion rights), since he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his questioning, Kavanaugh avoided questions about overcoming certain Supreme Court decisions.
‘This is not the time to send a hysterical, biased person to the Supreme Court and expect us to applaud it,’ said Pelosi.
And women have to deal with it.
It is a righteous rage, months and years of rage, and she cannot get it out without weeping.
"We cry when we are angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
He said, ‘I think it is not so strange, do you?’
She said: "I received good help from a woman who was my superior somewhere who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to, 'You may think I’m sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that was fantastic."
Tears are permitted as an outlet for anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs was in a man’s dominated office, and I began to cry with unexplained rage and was caught in the neck collar by an elderly woman — a cool boss whom I had always feared — who dragged me to a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said.
They do not know that you are angry.
They'll think you're sorry and happy because they managed to catch you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president.
In 1987, when Hart was exposed to cheat on his spouse on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the election, Schroeder became very frustrated and thought that there was nothing wrong with examining the possibility of running for president.
"It was not a deliberate decision," she said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last ones they needed were one more.
Some called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Since it was closer to the end of the campaign, she was behind with the funding and swore she wouldn't run if she didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of the supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she wonders.
When she gave the talk to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion — gratitude to the people who had supported her, frustration at the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to reach voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — that she collapsed into tears.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown”, recalling Schroeder’s comments on how the press spoke about her.
‘You would think Kleenex was my chief sponsor.
I remember thinking what they'd write on my tombstone.
'She cried?'"
How U.S. China’s Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening ointments in the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a long - term tear between countries can be beneficial to Beijing, say experts.
Donald Trump, president of the United States, fired the first warning earlier this year by placing customs duties on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tax rates worth $200 billion worth of goods, which means customs duties of half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Of course, Beijing has retaliated each time, now, at the latest, with an endorsement of 5 to 10 percent on U.S. goods worth 60 billion dollars.
China has promised to match the U.S. attack for attack, and the world's second largest economy will probably not raise the white flag immediately.
Getting Washington to step down means giving in to demands, but public submission to the United States will be too humiliating for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, the pressure around the trade war with the United States can provide a long - term positive measure for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In fact, the fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that start economic ripples in one of the countries is much more dangerous than the spectators have realized before, ” said Abigail Grace, a college of researchers who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a thought scheme.
Syria ‘ready’ for the remourning of refugees, says Secretary of State
Syria says they're ready for the voluntary tournament of refugees and oranges to help restore the country, which has been demolished after more than seven years of war.
When he spoke at the United Nations National Assembly, Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem said that the country is in better shape.
‘Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to progress in combating terrorism,’ he says.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
All circumstances now lie in motion for the voluntary retourage of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the one - sided economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, six million people still living in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the broken country.
But he emphasized that there would be no acceptance of conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the rebellion.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris.
Team Europe has won 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the United States team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in succession on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its throne when the Danish team captain Thomas Bjørn received the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in much of the tournament, mowed his tee-strokes in the water at par-316 holes, and had to watch himself beat by Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all his rounds and became one of four golfers who have ever walked 5-0-0 since the tournament’s present design in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 and 4 by the lowest ranking player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's most senior player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter from England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup finale.
With as many as eight Ryder Cup tournaments behind him, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the champion Europeans of the tournament through the ages of 25.5 career credits.
"I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas picked me out and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to get my cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He leaves the relay stick to his countryman John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in single Sunday.
“I am so proud to beat Tiger Woods — I followed that man as I grew up, ” said 23 - year - old Ramhm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a registration of 13-21-3 career credits in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the biggest golfers ever, who's won 14 major titles, only beat by Jack Nicklaus.
Team America struggled all weekend to find the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played golf with high precision throughout the tournament.
U.S. Team Captain Jim Furyk commented on a disappointing achievement for his platoon, “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
There were moments this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We threw ourselves.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great team captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and will look ahead.
I love these 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their team captain.
You just have to take your hat off.
We were beaten."
