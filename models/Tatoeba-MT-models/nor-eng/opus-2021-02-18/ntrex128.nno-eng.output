Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously.
Several members of the National Parliaments have recently been upset by a proposal to change their names from an assembly member to a member of the Welsh Parliament or the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came because of a plan to change the name of the Welsh Parliament's National Assembly.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A member of Labour said that his group was concerned by your "MWP rhymes on Twist and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, 'twp' means stupid and 'pwp' means poop.
A member of the Plaid Party said that the group is not satisfied and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an open mind when it comes to naming byte, but added that MWP is not far from the word 'mud'.
In this context, the Welsh letter w has been pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly’s delegation, which is now drafting legislation to introduce byte, said: ‘The final decision as to which members of the parliament will of course be up to members themselves.’
A Welsh official decision from 2017 gave the Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public announcement on the naming proposals that demonstrated a great deal of support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
When it concerns the title of the National Assembly Members, prefer the delegation Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP option was most supported by the Public Lounge.
The National Council members have allegedly come up with other proposals, but the struggle to become single has given principal importance to Elin Jones, the author of the delegation, who will submit the bill for a couple of weeks.
The legislation of the reforms contains other changes for the functioning of the delegation as well, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Members of the Council will be able to vote on what to name when they debate the bill.
Macedons are running the country in the name of the people.
The choosers shall move over on Sunday to change the name of their country to "The Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people’s suspension was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, a resister of the People's Recreation, said he's going to ignore the result.
Those who support people's suspensions, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin quiet as the cows in Harlem, New York, struggle
'The old ones I've talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a cowle at every corner,' said Adams.
‘Today none of these parts exist.’
He said he understands why the bars disappear.
"People socialize in other ways nowadays," he said.
‘Bers are no longer the pillars of the neighborhood that people visit normally.’
When it comes to cows, he's concerned that the money from selling their property won't last as long as the tenants think, and sooner or later they'll be back where they started.
He added that cows can be replaced by unit rentals filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historical locations in the neighborhood.
"Most people who buy unit trusts in these buildings are white," he said. "And so comes the day when all the cows are shut down, because it is not likely that these people who move into the unit trusts will become members of these cows."
Both kine were built of white soaks before Harlem became a black township - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin cowl a decade later.
The original white Methodist convention moved out in the 1930s.
A black soak that had been preached nearby moved into the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black bar by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also rented the boycott of the 125th Street stores, a main shopping street in Harlem where the owners opposed the sale or promotion of black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson’s followers planned to rebuild him, they also ordered a new clock game.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson Senior and successor of St. Martin, was proud and called the bellplay of the poor.
The expert who played the bell game in July called it something else: "One cultural treasure" and "one historical instrument which cannot be replaced".
The expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who leaves the cow to play the greater bell game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months has become a complicated tale of architects and builders, some of whom have been added by laymen to the cows, and others by the Episcopal bishop.
The Sacristi, which hires the so called and consists of the laymen, wrote to the episcopate in July with concerns that the diocese of the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay" even though the sacristy was not involved in its establishment of architects and builders.
Some of the members of the soak have complained about the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-year-old wounded by shark during hummer dives in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for hummies in California on the opening day of bumblebee season.
It's just before 7:00 a.m. on the morning near the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented on KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his girlfriend for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard that the goat was crying for help, and he paddled to the gum with a group and he pulled out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he only thought the guten was begeistra for catching a hummer, before he realized that the boy cried out, "Noko bit me!
Somebody bit me!
Heil his collarbone was torn off. Hammel said that he observed when he reached the boy.
And I cried, “That everyone may get out of the water – it is a shark in the water”; added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by air ambulance and taken to Rady Hospital for children in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's not certain what kind of shark it was as a withdrawal gut.
The lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a couple of weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy was seriously injured in his torso.
The authorities shut down access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there were more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most people are not afraid to be dangerous.
Store-jeda Sainsbury's bets on discretionary product
The British store-jeda Sainsbury's is gonna compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' zest product and provide department store services at the store.
As part of an investment in the United Kingdom's fair market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow and fashion and decoratingala goes down, Sainsbury's is going to test out their discretion product in 11 stores next year, and several stores if it's a success.
The investment in the discretionary product comes at a time when the shelves that used to be full with TVs, microwaves and interiors are empty.
Sainbury's said they'll double the number of discretionary products for 3,000 products and offer the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. Pawaw for the first time.
They're supposed to give Marks L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots stores.
The store should also refinish its own makeup series Boutique and make most products vegan, which will attract more young Kundar.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, the perfume handler, will test the halls of his perfumes in two of the Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a switch to buying small amounts of food every day from local retail stores means that big stores need to find new ways to reach them.
Mike Coupe, a management officer at Sainsbury's, commented that stores will look more and more like department stores, while stores are trying to fight low - price shops Aldi and Lidl with multiple non-food services and goods.
Sainsbury's has joined the interior chain of Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they purchased both chains two years ago.
The store’s previous attempt to renew the discretion and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's co-operation with Boot's early 2000s, but this ended when the parties didn't agree to how to split the profits from the drugstores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's Selde Pharmacy Kjeda Celesio, who had 281 pharmacies and owned pharmacies known to Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extended luxury series of skin products, including Marked La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: “We have changed the way the racks of discretion will look and experience to improve the environment for our great-uncles.
We have also added specialists with specialized skills to provide discretionary stents.
Our brands are designed to fit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical placements mean that we are now an attractive discretionary destination that distorts the old way of doing business."
Peter Jones 'Rasing' after Holly Willoghby resigns from a deal worth £11 million
The star from the TV show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is "racing" after the TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a deal with his lifestyle brand worth £11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to promote the interior and the worship of their Truly.
The couple's cooperation has been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
The host of the program This Morning, 37, made the newly arrived on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, in the middle of her new partnership for a lifestyle brand to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “racing” when golden Holly confessed to a ravishing session on Tuesday at Jones's main store in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - mean that she no longer has time to cooperate on interior and worship-revealing Truly.
The cooperation has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune at £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to make it known she's not going to work with Truly, and Jones ran away from Britain to calm down in one of her vacation homes.
One source said, "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term plan for the future, and would last for decades.
Determined to pull out has surprised everyone involved.
Nobody thought their own islands on Tuesday. Truly was this close to the launch.
There is a warehouse in Marlow filled with goods ready for saddles."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in Britain, can cost the company millions of dollars because of intense product investment, from cushions to candles to clothes and interior, and can cause delays with the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and his husband, Dan Baldwin, has been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly along with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the chairmanship in March.
Couple vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is going to be the brand ambassador for M/3S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night "We don't comment on his business."
♪ Tough talk and then we fell in love ♪
He was joking about the criticism he came to get from the media to make a comment that some might experience as "upresidentically" and to be so positive about the North Korean camper.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his bullshit voice as a newsletter.
'I have given up nothing.'
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a big step towards the disarming of the nuclear weapons program in North Korea.
But negotiations on the nuclear program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s Peak Diplomat Ri Yong Ho said to the UN’s annual general meeting of Saturday that North Korea has not received a corresponding response from the United States of America’s current North Korea’s early detoxification.
Instead, he added, continues the United States with sanctions to push North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his talk.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a wonderful relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rake testing, help free the hostages, and the return of the leases to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual way of dealing with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," said Trump and the pointer on the group standing in front of him.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquakes Destroy Island and Kill Hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign relief agencies were notified that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the residents of Lombok had to flee, no one declared national emergency, needed to obtain international help.
'Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very aware that they do not want international help, so it is a bit challenging,' said Sumbung.
With Save The Children put together a team to go to Palu, it is still not safe to add foreign passports to the field.
Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Crisis Agency in Indonesia, said that authorities assess the situation in Palu to see if international organisations are allowed to provide staff assistance.
Although Indonesia has a high incidence of earthquakes, the country is not a major predictor of natural forces.
In the Aceh area, they've built shelters for tsunamis, but they're not normal in the rest of the country.
Despite warnings against tsunamis in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to several victims.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural Catastropas makes logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat those that were damaged in the quake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the management of the Indonesian infrastructure during the presidential election and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year, there's an option again.
President Joko is also under pressure when sectarian tensions are involved in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative beliefs.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows and nests, and other primitive weapons.

"I saw that Kante came and picked up the ball once without thinking about it, and then I cut out the ball."
Chelsea rented 1-0 after the break after the scoring in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the target, Hazard handed the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he pave off the town near the center of the city and into the Liverpool half.

Parliament statue of Cromwell will be the last victim of the "Rewrite of Historia"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious artifacts in England that his Puritan followers did during the Borgar War of the 1600th century.
However, the Cromwell Federation described Crick’s proposal for the removal of the statue as ‘noise’ and ‘one attempt to rewrite history’.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Federation, said: “It was inevitable in the debate over the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Borgar war was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been out of the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's published representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century public munition, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of celebration."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defense of parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was against the monarchy, of course.
Whether or not this representation is correct is still a historical debate discussion theme.
What's certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that divide.
What he accomplished as Lord Proctor is also worthy of celebration and memory."
Mordar Pigs attack and kill Chinese peasants.
A pawn was attacked and killed by a pig on a field in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, with the surname Yuan, was found dead, with the cut artery and covered with blood, near a pig bin in the field of Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer proposes to give pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the field.
The next morning, he found his cousin dead and discovered that the gate to one of the pig pens was open.
He said that in the pen there was a large male pig with blood around his mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kg [250 kg] heavy pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and broken," said his cousin, named Wu, to Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras indicate that Yuan arrived at the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him didn't speak to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while the police collected evidence of the crime scene.
Yuan's family is now talking about compensation with the rent for the market.
Even if it's rare, these things have happened before.
In 2016, a pig grabbed a woman and the man died in Massachusetts, causing serious injury to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg heavy pig held a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife scared the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon became eaten by his hogs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba to CBC News reported that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can trigger animals.
They only want to play.
They like to bite a bit, they're curious... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring rain to the southwestern United States
As foretold in weather forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakened by the cooling water along the northern coast of Mexico.
Even so, Rosa will carry with her a downpour of rain to northern Mexico and southwest America for the next few days.
Rosa had wind strength up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 5: 00 p.m. in the eastern United States time zone on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, there is a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean moving east towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa comes near the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical wetness northward to the south-west United States.
Pink will bring up to 15 inches [25 cm] of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical dampness will react with low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, between three and ten centimeters [3 and 10 cm] of rain can cause dangerous embarrassment and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical moistness will result in rain between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour for some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest United States; especially over large sections of Arizona.
Fatherly embarrassment can result from scattered terrain and tropical rains.
There's a war going on in the desert on foot because of the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can turn canyons into embarrassing rivers and lightning and tore storms will bring strong winds and dust.
The rising low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total rainfall of more than one centimetres is possible, which can cause slight embarrassment and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain town for the season in the region.
Scattered tropical rain towns will start in Arizona late Sunday night and early Monday morning, before the rains rise late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic is getting colder, but tropical regions are still quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperature, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
The temperature range between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
The next few days, summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
A number of central and eastern United States are expected to experience a hot beginning of October, 25 degrees and up from the southern part of the major plains to parts of the north-east United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term warning indicates that there are high rates of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are watching the Brett Kavanaugh Voice
On Thursday, more than 20 million people saw the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. High Court and the woman responsible for sexual assault on the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political debate about the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programming of various broadcasters to reveal the latest findings on Friday: an entity reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake said the FBI will be investigating the assassinations during the next week.
Ford told the High Court Committee that she's 100% sure that Kavanaugh touched her when he was drunk and tried to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, in a sense, he's 100% sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw their heights on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this figure by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not ready from other channels showing the interception, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen is also having trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, a similar number of viewers look at an American football final or the Oscars.
Fox News hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the network was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested after the speech.
Flake was in focus during the Friday drama.
After Flake, a moderate republican, declared that he is on the Kavanaugh side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while Protestants shouted after him on his way to a hearing with a judge's committee on Friday.
He watched for several minutes while the protestants yelled at him on CNN live.
A woman said, "I am standing right in front of you."
'Do you think he tells the truth to our land?'
Some of them said to him, “You have power, and so many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office has made a statement, and before he went into the elevator, he said he wanted more time to talk during the committee's test.
The Broadcasting Bureau showed the audacity on TV when the Judiciary Committee was about to run for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to complete the Senate and further tossing.
But Flake said he could only do it if the FBI applied the claims against Kavanaugh during the next week, which the Democrats have also requested.
Flake was partly overwrought to talk to his buddy, the Democrat, and the senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake took a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not betray Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May places criticisms for ‘winning politics’ when Brexit is involved
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, reportedly told critics of the plans to leave the EU in order to ‘lause policy’ with the future of the United Kingdom without regard to national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend her Conservative party conference on September 29, 2018.
Next to the interview with May, on the front page of the Sunday Times, is an interview with the former foreign minister Boris Johnson, in which he goes to the so-called Chequers Plan for Brexit and says that the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's fees is "absolutely absurd."

“This is something we are always afraid of, ” Wade said.
Volcano barrages Mexico City
Popocatepetl volcano ash has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital city.
The national centre of crisis prevention requires Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after the activity increases in the crater and centre registered 183 gas and occlusion within 24 hours.
The center had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Social media photos show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted a rise in activity in the volcano, 72 kilometers [72 km] south east of the capital city, since a 7.1 - strong earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as Don Goyo and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the robbery about self-stuttering
Six Protestants were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after demonstrators for the self-stirring noise along with police officers, and thousands of other demonstrators protested a year after the robbery about any release from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police chiefs while they threw eggs and powder paint that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are normally full with tourists.
The compound also blurts out later in the day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours, separatist people shouted, "Don't forget, don't forgive" while Protestants shouted, "Long live Spain".
Local news channels reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries after protest.
The mood is still pressed in the region and many will still have themselves a year after 1 October, which was called illegal by Madrid, but was swept by separatists in Catalonia.
Most people choose to be self-employed, but there was also a low choice among those against self-stucking and boycotting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the theft and choice of the compound from occurring in the region.
Groups that were too self-suffering slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration went off anyway, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who shared in the separatist protests with his wife, said that he no longer hopes for the self - wearer in Catalonia.

Menga Scots give Livingston 1-0 sigs over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first target for Livingston is scribbled
Excited Livingston surprised the Rangers and Steven Gerrard to experience their second ring of 18 combates as training for the Ibrox Club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shoe turned out to be the difference, and Gary Holt's side would jam with Hibernian in the second.
Gerard's side has no distance signer in the Scottish Premiership Gang this season, and will play against Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six czars in a row, and Holt the head trainer hasn't lost since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses the road team's chances.
Holt's team should have rented long before they scora, and created more problems for the Rangers with their direct game.
Scott Robinson blurted through, but had a low stake in the goal, which meant Alan Lithgow had to work hard after his meeting with Craig Halkett's head over the target.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play before them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the determined goal became scora.
The Rangers went on a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson headed for Menga, who took a touch and scora from the center of the penal field.
Until then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and the goalie Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a target.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by the Rangers' goalie, Allan McGregor, and Littagow flinged far after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passings were sent back and forth in the Livingston punishment field, while two punishments followed by Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hand--were blown away.
Livingston Phenomenal Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont, Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal battle and a phenomenal outcome for Livingston.
Each player plays fantastically and still impresses on the curve up.
Their game and player style has hardly changed since they returned to the top class, but a lot of thanks for it goes to Holt for the way he's shocked the way he's been making it since he's become a gymnast.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense and organized a military defense while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the fight.
The Rangers, in contrast, were not motivated.
As good as they've been under Gerard, they weren't good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and they only cut up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize that they don't exist anymore.
Erdogan gets mixed welcome in Cologne
The Germans in Turkey and Germany smiled in the blue sky when they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been ineligible in terms of human rights, press freedom, and Turkey’s role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque because of "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan - many of the Kurdish - also showed up to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state determined to please him well in the country.
The duelling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who view Erdogan as a hero, and others who view him as an autocrat.

Long Lartin Prison in England, six guards injured in riots.
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security prison for men, says the prison office in England.
Intrusive disorder burst out into the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire about 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday.
Special Tornado forces are collected to calm the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a separated part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for petty injuries in the ducklet.
One prison official said: “Specially trained guards will calm down the ongoing rebellion in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate being chosen in our prisons, and we are confident that those in charge will be reported to the police and may be imprisoned longer.’
There were more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the United Kingdom.
In June it was reported that the warden was being treated for injuries after a prisoner went to prison.
And in October of last year, special chiefs had to come to the prison to calm down a serious riot, where the prisoner threw billiard bullets at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa believes Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with embarrassment (in favour of drought areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is just such a weather phenomenon headed for Arizona early next week, in the remnant of Hurricane Rosa pulling southwest across the desert, creating fear of embarrassment.
National weather service has issued warnings against embarrassment on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, including the towns of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, and can give rain already late Monday.
The Phoenix Twitra National Weather Service says that only “for ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 40 miles [60 km] within the Arizona border.’
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters [5 and 10 cm] of rain, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters [15 cm] in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona.
It can take from two to five centimeters (2 to 5 centimeters) in other areas of the southwest desert, including central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated volumes up to ten centimeters (10 centimeters).
For areas outside of Embarrassed Risk, the Rosa type may be a good idea.
Although the embarrassment is a serious concern, this rain is likely to benefit areas in the south-west United States that are subject to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme droughts in over 40 percent of Arizona, the second - highest drying category, reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will move across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With a wind of more than 75 miles [13 km] per hour, on Sunday morning, Rosa is 619 kilometers [619 km] south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 12 miles [19 km] per hour.
The storm meets colder water in the Pacific Ocean and calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
Mexico will rain a lot, which may increase the risk of embarrassment.
‘Ranges between 7 and 15 centimeters are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with potential height of up to 25 centimeters,’ reported weather.com.
Rosa will migrate north along Mexico as a tropical storm before she reaches the Arizona early Tuesday morning morning as a tropical low pressure, which will drag on through Arizona into southern Utah Tuesday night.
‘The greatest danger of Rosa or its remains is a lot of rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American Southwest Desert,’ said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life - threatening embarrassment in desert and mountainous landslides.

Trump wins Kavanaugh "lide" under where "smear and angry" the Democrats were against him
"The most important thing for the Dommar Kavanaugh is a blip on the mercyless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," said Trump under a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered during the "smoke and angry" Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, and was emotionally denied for the culpability of Christine Blasey Ford that he attacked her sexually decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave evidence of the hangings during his speech.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw how brilliant and brave ” Kavanaugh was that day.
"The most capable lawyer of our time, a lawyer with a perfect public service," he said to a multitude of followers in Western Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of how important it is for the Republicans to flash in between elections in the United States.
“Five weeks into one of the most important options in our lives.
I am not running, but I am running really,' he said.
‘That is why I travel around to fight for good candidates.’
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to resist and block.
The first important vote in the Senate about the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to happen late Friday, said a Republican representative to CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, counting the killings growing.
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by enormous waves on beaches, while a severe earthquake and a tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi reported authorities on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to attend a festival on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were 20 feet [6 m] high, hit the beach at sunset and took many people while they destroyed everything they came across.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 - magnitude earthquake.
‘Doing the warning about the tsunami coming yesterday, there were still people on the beach who didn't go right away and were victimized,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesia GDPB Emergency Relief Agency, in Jakarta.
‘As if the tsunami were not enough in itself, he dragged cars, wooden trunks, houses; he laid everything ashore,’ said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled across open sea at 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed into three to avoid the tsunami and survived in that way.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photo published by the Emergency Bureau shows many broken buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continue to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes could be marked in the area, with a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia’s Technology Test and Testing Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atom bomb of Hiroshima during the second world war.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow dared, may have increased the size of the tsunami, said the Agency.
Nugroho's damage as "involved" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found under the debris of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still slow.
Nugroho said that the number of casualties and the size of the destruction may be larger along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter of the quake.
'We haven't heard anything from Donggala, communications are cut' said Nugroho.
“More than 300,000 people live there” pronounced the Red Crossen, adding that their additions and volunteers are on their way to the raw areas.
'This is already a tragedy, but it can get a lot worse' said the Red Cross.
The emergency agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had a trip Palu, even though the authorities said that waves would come within the period of notification.
An amateur video shared by social media shows a man on the top floor of a building that cries desperately to the human being down in the streets to warn them against the incoming wave.
Minutes later, hit a wall of water on the coast and take with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not verify the video immediately.
The tremor and tsunami caused power failure and cut communication around Palu, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate staff assistance.
The military has started the process of sending in Naudian cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, reporting the authorities, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The jack of the city was reopened to receive the help of the court, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia’s death toll exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
They added to the World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu City and have set up tents in the back yard of their office.
“They told me they saw a lot of broken houses, ” he said.
It's very bad.
Some have complained that foreign assistant workers with crisis management expertise have been denied entry to Palu.
In accordance with Indonesian law, foreign relief agencies and deira may not start work until Indonesia has declared the area to be a national emergency zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
'It is a provincial crisis,' said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Junction.
‘When the state says 'OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open to international staff, but they have not updated their status yet.’
There's night again in the Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, and friends and families of those who are still missing hope for a miracle, but know that such natural characters don't end well.
On Saturday a little gut was saved from the sewers.
On Sunday, a woman was saved from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had a doctor trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandano, the coach for the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the slow paraglidians from the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man called Mandai said that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As one with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon told me that he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the Palu paraglidians who had taken part in the local beach festival, after he heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed.
But his messages only showed a gray chin, instead of two blue chins.
'I think it means the messages didn't arrive,' he said.
Thieves count $26,750 from Newport ATM, Levee, United States
On Friday night, thieves pay $26,750 from a company worker at Brink's in what he was about to fill up an ATM in Newport, Leve, U.S.A., according to a Newport police press release.
The worker had just emptied an ATM in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, said detective Dennis McCarthy in the press release.
As the worker was busy, "Range a man up behind the worker" and pay a bag of money to deliver.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they ran away from the scene, according to the press release, but the police could not determine the number of persons involved in the robbery.

Kanye West: The rappar will be renamed to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes names - to Ye.
He pronounced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and wrote, "The capitol once known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as his nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eight-year-old album, which he got out in June.
The change in his name came just before he was due to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to drop his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the song Ariana Grande on the show after she canceled because of "emotional reasons," said the host.
In addition to being a shortening of his current artist name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West earlier this year when discussing the album title with Big Boy radio host.
"So I am you, I am us, that is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects on who we are."
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is once known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he proposed the name Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who have been working with West before, has also changed the style of writing to the name with and without dash and upper case letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians.
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military armies against civilians, and it will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he “will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people. ”
On October 2, 1968, the military is moving on peaceful protesters and killings of about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were spreading in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has been allowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and open several free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double investment in artificial intelligence.
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the subject, winning the investor and the user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government spoke of artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year and aims to be number one in artificial intelligence innovation within 2030.
‘A doubling of the artificial intelligence research budget would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence,’ said Lee.
A doubling in funding may double the odds of the next major artificial intelligence breach in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book ‘AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ this month through Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the managing director (CEO) of the Sinovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
On the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranking player of the game Othello, and later he worked as a renter at Microsoft Research and was chairman of Google in China.
Lee noted previous technology competitors organized by the United States government, such as the Defensed Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked for the time of the next competition to be involved in and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, said Lee.
"It's not China to take the academics, it's the big companies," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have hired college graduates to work with artificial intelligence over the last few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to strengthen the research on artificial intelligence.
‘I felt that doctoral students within artificial intelligence should have automatic retention rights,’ he said.
The Council of State of China published its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Society of Natural Sciences finances academic institutions students, not unlike the American National Science Association and other government organizations’s way of distributing money to American researchers, Lee said, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center of artificial intelligence, which is supposed to involve industrial and academic partners, and the White House declared the formation of an artificial intelligence committee.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Association invests more than $100 million a year in research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the bill on national security and artificial intelligence in months.
Macedons are running the country in the name of the people.
The Macedonian people are on Sunday in a people's announcement whether they should change their names to the Republic of Northern Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, with a province of Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighboring northern country represents a claim on their territory and has used veto to vote against membership of Macedonia in NATO and the EU.
The two governments came up with an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalistic opponents argue that byte names can undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he should not be a rat, and a boycott has cast doubt on how far the population will reach at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the people's seat is, "Are you for NATO and EU membership and sole agreement with Greece?"
Supporting members of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the change in name is worth membership of the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved self-destruction after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to betray the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the voice is not binding in accordance with the law, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said that they will follow the result of the exchange to render it decisive.
In order to change the name, Parliament needs two-thirds of the payoff.
The State Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened within 1:00 p.m.
Only 16% had voicesta, counter to 34% in the previous 2016 parliamentary election, 66 out of all registered voters having voicesta.
"I belong to my children, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his Dushko stysta zone in Stramika, Macedonia, to change their names and opens to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the people in front of Parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not to change the name of our country," said Kavadarkov.
They said, "We are a poor land, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name of Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that members of NATO will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 per cent job resolution.
‘I believe that the majority will show up for the change, of your 80 per cent of our citizens will join the EU and NATO,’ said Zaev after having the weasel.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "a confirmation of our future".
A meaningful measurement of the previous month of Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will be participating in the People's Auction - which is below the required number.
Another significant measure of the Telma TV channel in Macedonia showed that 57 percent of voters plan to bounce on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said yes.
In order to close the people's movement, at least 50 percent must be at least loud, plus one voice.
Failure to close the people's suspension could damage the policy of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through the Brighton defence and scor
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling rejected the Brighton defense that led to 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scorad for 65 minutes.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine tip received a pass at the center of the line.
He steered past three Brighton defense players and reached open orbit.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He made it around one defense, before he ran past several others on the edge of the Brighton penal field.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English point used its first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton Keeper Mathew Ryan with a shoe right into the right end of the target.
‘Aguero still toils with his feet,’ said the City trainer Pep Guardiola to reporters.
‘We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate that he did so."
But it was Sterling who gave them the first advantage in the Premier League fight.
That target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He fired the ball beautifully along the left end of the bana to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball while renting Sterling towards the goal.
The sky - blue point kicked the ball into the goal immediately before he slipped out of the bana.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League Group phase at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler against the Rockies in American baseball.
With Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, and hopes to take "mound" on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to playoff for Rockies, who rent with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockie's water at least 5-2 against Nationals Friday night, but looking forward to locking on the First Division title.
'If we play for nothing, it is worth playing for the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who would not play with such circumstances?"
It's still not clear who's going to start at the Nationals on Sunday, but Scherzer may be going "pitche".
Scherzer, in which case starts for the 34th time, cast a "bullpen session" on Thursday and shall "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump collectors in West Virginia
The president made an obscene reference to his first choice for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the midterms of the United States.
“ Everything we have done so far is in play in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big, I'm not running, but I'm running everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump went forward, “You can see this appalling, appalling group of Democrats, you see it's happening right now.
And they're overconfident that they're definitely going to take back the power, you see how bad they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they wound, who they run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not gonna give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to oppose and block.
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sint and mean and gross and unhonorable."
He referred to Senators and Democrats Dianne Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
“ Do you remember the answer?
Were you the one who leaked the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh no, I expect--it was really bad body language--the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant to those who say what they mean.
When the Momentum Activist in my local party rantysta to censor me, it wasn't surprising.
I'm the last one in a series of Labor-MPs who've been told that I'm not well come - just to tell you what I mean.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for being rude to Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically, as far as economics, national security, Europe are concerned, and other similar issues of which Jeremy was unconcerned with previous researchers were concerned.
The call for the meeting at Nottingham East Labour on Friday said, "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive."
For the past eight years, my Labour MP has been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting wasn't like this, and the promise of "smill" politics is long forgotten, if it was ever followed.
It has become more and more apparent that different points of view are not tolerated in Labour and that each purpose is judged by the employees of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became partisan, when colleagues I used to be politically single, expecting me to change my mind and be single on matters I would never agree on, if it were national security or internal market in the EU.
When I speak public, it doesn't matter what I say, I always get yelled at social media and people want me to resign while they criticize the central policy and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I treat my colleagues who get sexist and racists straight towards them every day and who are still professionals and don't go off.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time period is how normal it has been to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
We are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone, for every vote of no confidence and for every change in party rules, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have told me to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will like me better.
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I entered Labour, when I was still walking on my schoolboard 32 years ago, it was because I was angry with Thatcher and how the government failed the country.
I've never hidden my political goals, nor in the previous ones.
No one in Nottingham East may have been in doubt as to what I stand for and who I am not single with.
To the people who ran the motion on Friday, I can only say that when the country is running against a Brexit who will harm private, local and public services, I don't understand why people care to waste their energy questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party.
But actually, the only message I'm entitled to Nottingham Momentum is to the voters in the valcrine, whether they're Labour Selectors or not: I'm proud to join you, and I promise that no one can make me go off or change my policy and prevent me from joining you in the way I think is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is a member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unoverwhelming Doctor Ayr peaks in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may have changed the result a little, but there is no doubt that Ayr intended to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership game today.
They are now at the top of the pallet as the only unoverpowerable layer of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and the ability to take chance that gave their home team and their third, Peter Murchie, good reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr compliment, they were better than us to take a chance."
Grant Anderson had a "try" for 14 minutes, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," as putta Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland Captain Rory Hughes of Warriors let Melrose collect, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try".
Climo got a penalty just before the break, he scora and converted a solo try to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the other half well and Patrick Anderson's "try", which was converted by Baggot, reduced the growth by five points.
A long break occurred when Ruaridh Knott was seriously damaged and applied to the stretcher, and from the restart fauk Ayr forwards through a try from Stafford McDowall, such as Climo 'converted'.
The working captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, got a yellow card, and once again Melrose tried an unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struen Hutchinson received yellow cards to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty line, scora MacPherson an 'try'.
Climo “converted” again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's “box kick” and sent “flanner” Gregor Henry away from his home team fifth “try”.
The star from the Scottish show, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant business.
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays along with his partner Greg Hemphill.
The Duo has announced that the coming 9th season will be the last, and Kiernan seems to plan his life after Craiglang.
Following official lists, he's the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The code player will not comment on the sake, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has been hinted that Kiernan would be involved in the “progressive restaurant business” in Glasgow.
«The sea is ours»: Bolivia hopes that the court will open waterways to the Pacific Ocean
Sealers patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public building flags with a sea blue flag.
Marine bassar from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River is covered with the motto: “The sea is ours.
And an obligation to return to it.’
In landlocked Bolivia, people can still be reminded of a coastline that it lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 1800s.
These hopes may be stronger than in decades, while Bolivia waits for the judgment of the international court to arrive on October 1, after five years of change.
‘Bolivia is at ease, calm and forward, expecting, of course, a positive result,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the decision of the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague Court will support Bolivia’s demands and that after decades of actions, Chile - will give Bolivia a self - determination to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic President of Bolivia - who is struggling to be elected again next year - has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
"No we shall soon return to the Pacific," he promised late August.
But some analitans don't believe the court will allow Bolivia access to the ocean - and that little would have changed even if they got access.
The Netherlands-based UN court does not have the power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has suggested that they will not determine the outcome of any actions.
The fact that the court's decision comes only six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case was "not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
In the last four years, far from being Bolivia's case, they've done the opposite.
‘The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,’ said Zárate.
Morales, with her belligerent rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's good will in Zárate.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issues after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was indiscreet.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "slash out at 139 years of ineligibility and benefit both of them," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the fact that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, used this maritime issue to win weasels.
‘Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The judgment is a possibility to see what we need to do to forget the past.’
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States of America.
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his nation may not be the first to abolish, unless they can trust Washington.
Ride spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He advised the United States to follow up on the raising of the meeting in Singapore between the American and North Korean laymen.
Riding their comments comes at a time when the U.S. Foreign Minister, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his sealed nuclear diploma, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with the North Korean Leary, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues to sanction and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean war.
Washington is reluctant to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang decapitating first.
Both Kim and the American President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many people are critical that Pyongyang means seriously when it goes down and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plan to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the other Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headgear is the latest fashion on the way to a shopping street near you.
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, you won't have to search anymore.
The signers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a large and special headgear in their SS19 collection.
The maximum impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations straight on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a lavish beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, wide brim that covered its models head.
There were other exaggerated worship heights during the fashion show, including a jeweled vasemelon, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture.
One of the creations looked like diving gear, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like an ice cream in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just forget about it.
Fashion experts predict that the giant hats come for saddles in a shopping alley near you.
The oversized hats come right after La Bomba, the straw hat with the 60 cm wide brim that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cool brand behind the most impractical hat, which was all over the social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk--a straw beach bag the same size as the bikini-dressed model that carried her.
The beach bag, with the colour of burnt orange and the fringed top with a white leather handle, was the most obvious part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection under the Moveveka in Paris.
Luke Armitage’s famous writer commented on the FEMAIL: “I expect to see large hats and beachbags in the next fashion store that summer - the designer has made such an impression that I doubt that there is any way to ignore the demand for overdimensional worship. ”
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Privates in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continues in 2018 with excellent examination results, which are only enhanced by individual and common success in sports, art, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, they work in the schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Self - Control (SCIS), to offer the best services to students and to parents.
It is the goal of self-restraints to prepare their pupils for advanced and higher education, career direction and role as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an tailor - made curriculum, modern languages are popular in school.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just lean in English when we want to build relationships and trust in people from other countries.
Looking at the results of the exam this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest grades for self-surrender.
A total of 68 percent of students who took the lead received A.
Data collected from SCIS’s 74 membership companies show that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also got A.
This shows that self - control in Scotland supports prognostic languages as vital properties, which children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Languages such as valphics are considered equivalent to STEM (knowledge, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the syllabus to self-scows and other places.
A review conducted by the British Selection for Addition and Properties in 2014 showed that 17 percent of work options were slow to fill jobs due to lack of language skills in searchers.
So language in school is more and more important to direct young people to work.
With multiple job skills for language experts, these properties are essential in a globalized value.
No matter what kind of career a youth may have, if they have learned a second language, they have a fair advantage in the future with such a property.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically provide a multilingual person with a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Britars in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any languages other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education for our children is so important.
Multilingual skills, especially those used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each one is different when it comes to the languages they teach.
Many schoolers focus on classical modern languages, while others teach languages classified as important in Britain when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interests, there will always be plenty of language to choose from in self - control, as well as specialist teachers in this area.
Scottish self-scouting is dedicated and wants to create a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the properties they need to close, no matter what the future brings.
You can't deny that in this global business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this has to be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called ‘international communication properties’.
Self-sacrifice will continue to offer this option and thus offer many and high competences for Scotland's young.
I faut been le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Self - Control
LeBron is debuting in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The waiting period is almost over for fans who need to see LeBron James debutees on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James is playing the preseason game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long to play has not been determined yet.
“It will be more than one minute and less than 49”, Walton announced on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, tweet that James will most likely play a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' timetable for the preseason.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump is starting on a whirlwind of combatanjar tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stops the coming week, including stops at friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation voice pending to choose to fill the vacant position of the maximum rights, Trump is aimed at building up support for command in the middle as the Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump going to be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's gathering in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday 29th of September 2018.
You can see Trump's West Virginia collection online below, through live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably bring up this week's raise of maximum rights-nominated Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited about sexual abuse, with an expected confirmed voice from the Senate on hold for up to a week while the FBI is investigating.
But the primary goal of this cave of collections is to help the Republicans meet the November Vala and get some momentum.
So, President Trump's campaign says that these five collections in the next week are entitled to "suggest volunteers and supporters such as the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Conviction control is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the busy campaign season," according to a spokesman for the Trump campaign who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Planned for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the collection for the evening can bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and withdraw coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, he will be watering with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who's in demand for the polls.
'It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the measurement of the purpose,' said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, following Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team America is showing stomach for fight to keep hope alive on singles on Sunday.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup-en thong is.
The swinging pendulum of moment is a completely invented sport, but one that players really believe in, and never more than competitions like these.
So each of them should say that moment is now?
'They had a six-point rental, and now there are four, so we take it as a small moment, I suppose,' said Jordan Spieth as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points leading to 12 more in games.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know that they have a little wind in their seals, and they have a lot to contrast with, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas playing together all day, and each has three points from four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and rents for them.
The boytural cries of his celebration grew higher as his round continued, searching an important putt to match four all-squao. are when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt as water the 15th battle met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you he thinks the American team isn't out of this.
‘You have really only been allowed to dig deep and worry about your own fight,’ said Spieh.
It is all that each of these players has left now.
18 holes to create an emblem.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas for the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unwinnable story of Ryder Cup.
Europe's remarkable, but cute couples are four from four and can't make a mistake.
Moliwood was the only couple that wasn't supposed to shoot an arcey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on a course with 18 holes) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, dedicated audience, cements that they are the players to be beat on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European sign when the sun goes down on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talk about European glory will be even earlier.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did very little work by Sergio Garcia, the fireball hero of the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One arc and two doubles on the first nine, the coarse Spaniard and the Swede entered a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closeness because of the interaction between the opponents, advice they give, and counsel they don't give and the way that a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lease into the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team America has the stomach for the fight that someone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10 to 6 in the Ryder Cup finals.
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-balls and foursome games with a 10-6-league across the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari leased the charge with two segregations over a fighting Tiger Woods to take their match so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side placed a booth to keep the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a misfired American page in Morgon Fourballs, and took the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes and water two games, but they could not retrieve the subshoes.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 single games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after an exciting weekend, are just the second couple to win four points from their openings in four games in the Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they were so great to beat an outpatient Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more sought-after 5 and 4.
Woods, who ran through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who wailed at the morning’s fourballs, returned to his partner Henry Stenson in the foursomes to a defeat of two and one by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not yet have everything they wanted on a pleasant, windswept day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
Watering a brave 2 & 1 sign over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and coming back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursomes when they lost the two holes in the open.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a layer come back from a four-point pad and go into single, although as owners, Furyk's page needs to be drawn only to keep the trophy.
After being the next best for two days, however, it seems that a Sunday counterattack would be outside of them.
North Korea says it's not going to be a matter of arming down one-sidedly without trust.
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United States of Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will grow, and that the country would by no means give up its nuclear weapons one-sidedly under such cover.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general meetings of the World Government that North Korea had made "meaning measures" to improve conditions in the past year, for example, they've stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test city and forbidden the spread of nuclear weapons and technology.
"We still don't get anything similar back from the United States," he said.
‘Untrusted in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.’
While Ri, a known North Korean, has produced several complaints of Washington's resistance to a phaser approach to nuclear deterrence, where North Korea would be paid to take gradual steps, his disorganization indicated itself preeminently by not rejecting one-sided nuclear deployment, such as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement written by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit meeting, any anger between a sit-down American president and a North Korean lay-out in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the "Development of Nuclear Power on the Korean Peninsula" and Trump allowed guarantees for North Korea to be secure.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted conversations to facilitate harsh international sanctions in North Korea.
‘The U.S. insists on ‘building nuclear power first’ and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by coercion, and they even contradicted ‘the declaration of peace,’ said Ri.
"The threat that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those not interested in us.
But the problem is that when sanctions continue, our distrust will only grow."
Ride nothing on the plans for a new summit meeting between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. president highlighted at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister weighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea's tenant, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added, "If the party in this promotion to nuclear disarmament was South Korea, and not the United States, the downgrading of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Yet the note of Ri was dramatically different from last year, when he told the General Assembly of the F.N. that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles against the mainland, after the U.S. President Trump of Evil called Kim a rocket man on suicide missions.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, ausa praises Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that a lot of work still had to be done and that sanctions had to stay in place for North Korea deviates its nuclear weapon.
And on Wednesday Trump said that he had no time frame for it, and said, “If it takes two years, or three years, or five months, it does not matter.”
China and Russia claim that the F.N. Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the actions that have been taken.
But the U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the F.N. Security Council on Thursday that: “The acts of the Security Council must still be strongly upholded and without failure until we get the complete, final, verified resolution of the nuclear weapons.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb the drug for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the F.N. General Assembly and said afterward that he would visit the Pyongyang again next month to prepare a new summit meeting.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that there had been progress, but few hours later North Korea condemns him for coming with "gagster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile city as well as an atomic complex if the United States were to do 'complying actions'.
He said that Kim had told him that the corresponding actions he sought were security guarantees such as Trump Lawa in Singapore, and a step towards normalizing his relationship with Washington.
Harvard students are taking classes in getting enough sleep.
This year, a new Harvard University course has helped all students to get more sleep, in an attempt to fight against the growing macho culture of studying caffeine all night long. It will say that caffeine is used to stay awake all night to study.
One scholar found that high school students often have a lack of care when it comes to the most basic — how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he thinks is the first of his kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
'At the end of that, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I told this now, when I was of old age?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping -- which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to the students what is important to how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, and improves their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and administering director of health services to the university, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students got seriously poor sleep during the week.
The hourly course contains a series of interactive tasks.
In one paragraph there is an image of a dormitory, where students click on coffee tops, curtains, gymnasiums and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and how important evening raisins are.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily Rutines.
'We know it won't change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know -- just like you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, la Prof. Czeisler.
The proud culture of daily living still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Making sure that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon for stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding weight gain, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in suffocation mode and makes it constant.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, after being a student of his last year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all PhD students to complete a similar study program before they start at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler advised that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as for when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue lights’ originating from electronic monitors and LED lighting, which can convert the internal clock completely, resulting in problems of sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga targets bring down Gerard's men
The Rangers went on a second slip on the trail when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerard's undecked page to a 1-0 loss on Livingston.
The Ibrox page was looking for its first signer on the away trail since 4-1-triumfen on St Johnstone in February, but made for Gary Holt only caused Gerard's second defeat in 18 games as a renter, and gave eight points, a round during Ladbroke's renting of Premier League, Hearts.
The Menga struck at seven minutes before half-time, and a Ranger set-up with lack of inspiration never seemed to equalize.
The Medan Rangers now drop to sixth place, climb Livingston to third and only lie behind Hibernian on target.
And there may be an additional problem in Rangers' warehouse after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a wound in the head after an object appeared to be thrown from the far side.
Gerard made eight changes to the layer that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who scored a point with a slip-scot last week, and he would've been thrilled by the way his fancy outfit took the Qualar roof of his resistance on each shift.
The Rangers may have had the ball most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scora after just two minutes when Menga's first post sends Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfield player fails to win his chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense party, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot a long way back.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third round.
Alfredo Morello's felt strongly that he should have suffered punishment on the 20-yard mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Dommar Steven Thomson waved away the request for the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to score two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalie Liam Kelly was hardly worried about Lassana Coulibaly's headar and a tame shoe from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening for the 34th minute may have been against the players' rules, no one can deny that they were only igniting it because of the "scot".
Again fail Rangers to handle a deep death ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher hit Scott Robinson's ball, which stayed cool to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard left at the intermission as if he were trading Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and switching them for immediate action when the wing player created a window for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rased forward to block.
Livingstone, however, continues to overlist the guest team to play the exact game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out longscots on the longscot.
Holt's team could've increased their renting at the end, but McGregor was very good at preventing Jacobs from doing it, until Litgrow put a long story from the corner mark.
The Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim on punishment when he ran into Jacobs, but once again Thomson missed it.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger enumerator
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and VI REKNAR... the day when John Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific girder ever since then, the Geiger enumerator was also a supporter in pop culture, as in the 1950 bells of Coronado film, with the seemingly false - minded cowboy explorers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He said, ‘What is this, the world?’
Rogers: "It is a Geiger counter; it can be used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set these island telephones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoma produced by the radioactivity in the minerala.’
Evans said, "Yes, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
“Hans” Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that asks his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” red cells.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” red cells and kill them.
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise red cells as part of the treatment

A sample vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with vaxina, who teaches the immune system to recognise red cells, experienced ovarian cancer over more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein that is common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjisate the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 “Produce the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extract immune cells from patients and learning how to measure against cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West ordered a Pro-Trump Diatribe, wearing a MAGA cap, after he hosted a Saturday Night Live TV show.
It didn't work out so well.
Kanye West was shot out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in commending his president, Donald Trump, and said he'd turn up for election in 2020.
After doing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he wore a Make America Great Caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated supported to Trump.
'So many times I talk to a white person and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I were worried about racism, I'd have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a number along with a comic book named Matt Damon, where Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's legal committee on sexual assaults by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, recordings to West's tirade were uploaded to the social media by comic Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to taunt West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had the hard backstage because of his headgear.
“Dei bullied me behind the scene.
They said, don't go out there with that hat on.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place," he said, according to Washington Examinor.
West continued: 'Would you like to see the sunken place' he said: 'Put on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Would you like the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments led to an ejection at least twice from the audience, and the SNL cast members seemed painfully affected, Variety reported, with a person there who told the publication: “Heil studio was dead quiet”.
West was brought in as a late replacement for the song singer Arina Grande, when his former lover, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused a lot of people with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West got support from the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candace Turner as twittra: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOUR ATTENDANCE TO THE POLICE”.
But the talk show hostess Karen Hunter twittra that West 'was pretty simple just as he is and it's absolutely fantastic.'
‘But I did NOT choose to protect anyone (by buying his music or dressing or supporting his “arts”) whom I believe is perceived and spews out ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
So are we' added.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said he was now "the formula known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Conrappar, Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington targets toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow of HBO's veritable medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the shoe player, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, and says that such roles on the screen often lead to young gutar feeling that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that he thinks something went wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #Metoo age.
Kit, who recently married her Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "quite strong" to address the problem.
“Personally I am informed that something has gone wrong with masculinity, ” he said.
'What have we taught men when they are grown up, when we see the problem now?'
Kit thinks that TV is partly responsible for the toxic masculinity of a very male character.
He goes on to say, "The Keva is inborn and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young gutars feel that they must be this separate side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones sequences or sequences at the end of the series in summer, and says he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November on, Kit will be playing in a re-recording of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The screenplayer recently revealed that he's watching his wife's meeting with Rose to be the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“ I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life to go on, ” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the prize of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Prize-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 on Leslie's familyhood in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820 000 people are the frame in the country, saying health is added.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new occurrences were transmitted through sex and marked a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China following contaminated blood transfusions.
But the amount of people who got HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health professionals at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Yet, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ individuals is claimed to be outflantors.
Because of the conservative values in this country, students have taken a talk party that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually want to marry women.
Many of the transfers of disease-domains come from inappropriate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has allowed universal access to HIV medicine as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters nectar that adds sheets of information from the GOP sensor, it explodes in 'fatheral lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
The United States of America, Rep. Maxine Waers, on Saturday, condemned allegations that a member of the staff had published personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the Legislature.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were pedaled by "extrem right-hand" searches and web pages.
"Liars, lies, and more contemptuous lies," said Waters in a Twitter phrase.
The published information included information-oriented home addresses and phone numbers of American Sens. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during his Senate panel on sexual assaults against highly-appointed Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came once after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites that Gateway Poundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the article was linked to Waters' office and published the information to a member of Waters' staff reported Hill.
‘This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie,’ continued Waters.
“One of my additions - that has received its identity, personal information and security compromised as a consequence of these unreal and false claims - was by no means responsible for the leakage of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie."
Water’s message was quickly criticized on the Internet, among other things from the former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", wrote Fleischer.
‘This indicates that it does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone gets blamed for something they didn't do, they must not be angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not be questioned about the motive of the offender.
They must be resident and resident."
Fleischer was found to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats of the Dommar Kavanaugh, who was blamed by critics for being seemingly angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to take over Water's place in the middle election, also expressed his tanks on Twitter.
"Big if it's true," he said, "twittra."
In his opinion, Waters said that the office had announced “the right governments and the legal entities of these false claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," "and that they will remain legally responsible for all their actions which are devastating and dangerous to each and every one of my associates."
Johnny English strikes again - spy rabble of weak Rowan Atkinson
It's traditional to look for Brexits in every new film with a British angle, and it is akin to this reviving of Johnny England's action comedy spoof franchise that started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was reinvigorated in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-ironic satire, renegotiate how unobtrusive we are, become the new export government in the country?
In any case, the grandaugde, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber duck has, for the second time, renewed his license to fuck things up--his name signals more than anything else that he's a wide comedian for cinematizers in non-English countries.
He is, of course, the foolish, secret agent who, despite his bizarre desire to spread a little glamour, has received a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the fellow who contributes a simple melody to the Fire Wagons, the theme of the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the no forgotten Barclaycard TV advertisers, which left chaos behind.
There are one or two great moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English as he came close to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval suit of armor and the rotor blade beats against his helmet.
Atkinson's riddle for physical comedy is on the screen, but humor feels quite weak and strangely redundant, especially since "serious" film marks that 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels as if he's aimed at children instead of waxing, and to me, Johnny England's noisy accidents are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's unspoken nonsense in the person in Bean.
The permanent current claim is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hack has infiltrated Britain's super-inhibited web network of spies, covering off the identities of every agent in the UK, to the dismay of the operative at work -- a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who's a pompous and war-herd figure, who already has a complete collapse of political impulsivity: Emma Thompson is doing his very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not much in the script to work on.
The communications counsel will inform her that when every active spy has been executed, it has to retrieve someone who has retired.
And that means that the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a certain elegant establishment, but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of great jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type Academy of Spying.
English is being sent back to Whitehall for a naud situation briefing and renegotiated with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to a submarine job, an overenthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to turn things into fearfully mad in Hennar's Secret Services is back to full-scale meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatal, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerous under the charismatic technology of the billionaire's spell, which claims he can solve Britain's computer problem: the unsavory Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like game: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and sneak onto Volta's yacht; and English extrudes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality kit to familiarize himself with the inner of Volta's house.
I'm sure all stopped has been pulled out to the last sequence, but as gracious and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a lot of children's TV all over the place.
Pretty moderate stuff.
And like with the other Johnny English movies, I couldn't help but think, can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes justice his talent?
Labor Party Labor denied that they are working out a plan for the English to work a four-day week, but paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is now considering a radical plan that wants Brits to work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
According to the report, corporate managers will send further savings made by artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Then you'd be able to enjoy a three-day weekend and still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would match the economic agenda of the party and plan to increase the distribution of workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
An older source from Labour told The Sunday Times: a policy report is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits the approach the party has to balance the economy in favour of the workforce, as well as over the party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to recognise such an idea, since the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 campaign.
However, the ambition has not been accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day workweek is not party policy and it is not being evaluated by the Party.'
Shaganslar John McDonnell used the previous week's work conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from faceless executives and profiteers in wealthy businesses.
Shadow slider's planes also mean that the current stockholders of the watercourse cannot get their full wager back when a Workrelation could make a "reduction" because of perceived misbehaviour.
He has also verified plans to add 10 per cent of its own capital to the company manager and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (including ownership funds) in order to provide 10 per cent of its own funds for the purposes of the private sector, which would receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds, approximately NOK 5000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the 60 Minutes TV program if the FBI, investigating Kavanaugh, could have them change their tanks.
The FBI inquiry about complaints against the Domsman Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for at least a week's maximum, and it raises the question of what extent the finding of the bureau might have affected some Republican senators to draw support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley asked in 60 Minutes the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could cover up anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
‘I said on my way into the hearing, I said, I have talked to the Dommar Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, that claim came out and said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unqualified."
Graham's voice still seemed seen in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Board strongly denied it, ‘Glass added Graham, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
‘And all of its names could not confirm it.
That's 36 years.
I do not see anything new changing.’
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday is the host of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event that has a vastly impressive array of stars that appear and an equally impressive mission, ending the poverty of the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flocking to Central Park's big lawn, not only to see Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes performing, but also to increase with knowledge of the true goal of the event of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people that are actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert jokes had to complete a number of tasks, or actions as voluntary work; send e-mails to a world manager, call a phone call or other meaningful means to help increase their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen been by 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of avoiding people with a free concert a real way of taking over people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clicktivism" -- people feel that they're doing a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million ‘actions’ from its support players, and participated in and pressed on a variety of targets.
It says that these actions have contributed to the ability of world tenants to make commitments and policies equivalent to more than 37 billion dollars, which will affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people within 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and publications accompanying their actions, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that so far, almost 649 million people around the world have been affected directly.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British party trust by investors and translators who are committed to ‘helping children achieve their full potential’; promising to give Rwanda $35 million in order to help eliminate malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, givars, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history," said the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, the audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that Britain be better at nutrition for mothers and children, the British government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children on nutrition treatment.
In answer to one of the usual questions on the Web page, they ask you, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the big borgarretts and the anti-apartheids, we'll fall off, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who are performing this year's event in New York, who will be introduced by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Fleet as a blockade to prevent Russian energy export - internal secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has international Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate on the invitation of the legitimate government - is an effort to explore new energy fields.
‘I believe that they are in the Middle East, that they want to distribute energy, just as they are in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,’ he is quoted as saying.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
‘USA has this birth, with our fleet, to ensure that sea roads are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy is not running on the market,’ he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event arranged by Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group that introduces itself as ‘the energy consumer’ in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to handling Russia and Iran, and noted that they are actually the same.
‘The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,’ he said, referring to Russia as a ‘one-trick pony’ with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as Trump Administration has been mandated to increase the export of floating natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to take over Germany to withdraw from the “unsuitable” North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly underlined that the North Stream 2 pipe diversion, which is designed to double the existing pipe diversion capacity of 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin asserts that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is only driven for economic reasons, and is a judgment of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the position that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to select suppliers," said Russian energy minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States held has withdrawn a setback from Germany, which has verified its commitment to the project.
Germany’s Leading Industrial Organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has encouraged the United States to stay away from EU energy policies and bilateral appointments between Berlin and Moscow.
‘I have a major problem when a third state is disrupting our energy supply,’ said Dieter Kempf, a source of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Kanslar Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will run "hard" to run for president in 2020, wins Massachusetts Senator.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she'd take a hard look at running for president after the midway.
At a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running for office.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top," said she in line with The Hill.
‘After 6 November I will carefully consider running for president.’
Warren joined President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting and said that he is ‘ misdirecting this country. ’
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," said she.
Warren has been harsh in his criticism of Trump and his top-class Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI inquiry before the vote."
However, a volume measurement published on Thursday showed that Warren’s own choice of choice does not indicate that he should be running for candidate in 2020.
Fifty-one percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not be running as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Centre/ Boston Globe inquiry.
Thirty - two percent supported such a candidacy.
The investigation showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with respect to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he wanted to decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) on Donald Trump collection.
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being enlisted in September.
He was arrested and charged with an emergency event in his home on Monday night.
‘If my own son goes through, what he goes through when he comes back, I can relate to other families characterized by PTSD and some of the sores our soldiers return with,’ she said to the audience at a collection for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his zone and other veterans that "they return a little changed, they return here, they come back here, they come back and wonder if what they and fellow soldiers and airplanes and all other military have done for the country exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was blamed for being physically chosen in his home against a woman, for disturbing a report about being chosen in his home and storing a weapon while he was high, as did Dan Bennett, spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and districts in Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims who fly from the gang default or who are chosen at home.
Representatives from the 18 states and district filed a friend-of-law on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who detracted from politics, reported NBC News.
The prosecution's full name in Grace v. Sessions matches the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Freedom Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been compromised.
She said that the party's party's going "and the select gang bangers" abused her, but American officials denied the request for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of Grace’s sponsors describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce large numbers of American asylum seekers, whom nations face massive problems with gangs and violence in their homes.
The new American asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from immigration law, which allowed illegal immigrants to flee from their home to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "signs decades of state, federal and international law."
‘Born law requires that all asylum cases be put to death in respect of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a barrier is contrary to this principle,’ said friend-of-court card.
Lawyers further stated in summary that policies that deny access harm the U.S. economy, and say that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and ‘offer necessary work’.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration authorities to cease giving asylum to victims who escaped abuse and gangld in June.
‘Asyl is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political enterprise,’ said the Sessions of 11 June of the emancipation of politics.
Asyl was never meant to align all the problems - even any serious ones - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate that rescue work in Palu and death-counting doblast in the race to find survival
To survive, the situation became more and more serious.
'It feels very tense,' said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who trotrayed her fevery baby zone at an evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Quart minute comes ambulance with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.’
Citizens have been observed on their way back to their broken homes, in what they are searching through watered parts of their own and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the earthquake - damaged hospital, which had a magnitude of 7.5, was overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken back and shoulder, were hovering outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were being treated outdoors because of still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes and told him that he felt the powerful earthquake shaking hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
'There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think, “declared Haris to the Associated Press, and added that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife scream for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe."
The U.S. ambassador charged China with mobbing with propaganda advertisers
One week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper and highlighted the mutual advantages of trading with the United States and China, the American ambassador against China Beijing charged the American pressure to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States reported on last Wednesday to China Daily's paid off in the Des Moines registry - the state of Iowa's largest salsavis - after sculpting China to try to mix in the U.S. Congress on November 6, a sculpting China denied for.
Trump's bell was that Beijing was trying to get involved in American elections, marking what American officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign of Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertising to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them increase their taxes on each other's imports.
China’s reciprocatingstar early in the trade war was designed to meet exporters in states such as Iowa who supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former long - standing governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
"China", wrote Branstad in an opinion section of Sunday's Des Moines registry, "doblade no bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In their propaganda dissemination, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's beloved freedom of speech tradition and a free press by adding a paid ad to the Des Moines register," wrote Branstad.
“In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you find restricting offsetting voices and will not see any true shimmering of the various endeavors that the Chinese people may have on China’s troubled economic path, given that the media are under the fixed thumb of the Chinese Communist Party, he “crushes. ”
He added that “one of China’s most advanced newspapers turned away from publishing ” his article, even though he did not say what for a newspaper.
Republicans present female voters leading the middle term with Kavanaugh Debacle, warned Analitakar.
When many of the top Republicans are on stand-by and defend high-ranking Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assaults, the analgesics have warned that they will probably see a setback, especially from women, in the coming midway options.
The compounds around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have registered that they already wanted to move forward with a voice.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of State Science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said that he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) the latest recent press for an FBI investigation will be enough to row angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday--they will not forget it tomorrow, nor in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior councillor and national spokeswoman for the progressive movementon group on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters "November is coming!" while they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who preside over the Court Committee, decided to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
‘Democracy enthusiasm and motivation will be beyond the chart,’ said Stu Rothenberg, a non-particial political analgesic, to the news site.
‘People say it has already been high, it is true.
But it can get higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not liking the president, often don't fit.'
Even before Ford’s public testimony, which detailed the allegations of sexual assault against the highest-level nominee, analitans suggested that a setback could follow if the Republicans pressed the confirmation.
'This has been a confused mess for GOP,' said Michael Steele, former lecturer of the Republican National Committee, early in the previous week, in the order of NBC News.
‘It is not only about the voice of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it is also about how republicans have handled this and how they have treated her,’ Guy Cecil, Director of the Priorities USA, a group that works with the selection of Democrats, pointing to the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little split over who they're going to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little bit more siding with the last board.
A new study by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they believed that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lug under his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Under the pressure of Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, and at least another complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford knows for the Court Committee to the Senate in the last week that Kavanaugh was completely assaulted at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the highest-titled showed her the genital organs while attending a party during the 1980s at Yale University.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup seeking to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company built by Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the Inrut device is "World Domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
‘It is a historical moment.’
This app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online repository" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memory lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser and all at once.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is completely up to the user who can access any kind of information.
The company calls it ‘personal authority through data’.
The idea of Inrupt, following the managing director of the company John Bruce, is that the company include resources, process and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently composed of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some added developers with a contract to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer codes.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google not to implement a complete change in which all their business models are completely turned over overnight.
'We do not ask their permission.'
In an article on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a voice of great influence in the online neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will become the founding founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.

The only English cycad deity as watering a Victoria Cross in the first world war as a fighter has been swept in his home city a hundred years later.
Lt Col. Pastor Bernard Waters awards on September 29, 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Nevertheless, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons on a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Water, said it was "brilliant symbolic," that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to London Gazette, the Lt. Col Water Battalion over Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, “through a very thick shutter and under heavy old from the ground and machine guns. ”
Later, he ran up to the front line, and with the “greatest gallantry, ” he led the line forward before rushing forward with a field gun and knocking out three of the group.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - a little over a month before the war ended.
Michael Water, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "whatever I know I could never live up to, but something I'm a little over."
He and his brother Dr. James Water also laid a wreath after the parade, which was rented by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Water said that he felt a great era of playing a role in the parade, and added that “the value of a true hero is shown by the support of many people. ”
MMA fans stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Gris instead.
Now imagine this, you've been up all night watching a package of Bellator 206men and you won't see the main event.
The San Jose coverage contained 13 games, including 6 on the main card and was shown live through the night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m. on the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald planned to meet together, viewers in Britain were again sedated when coverage changed to Peppa Gris.
Some were not impressed after they stayed awake to the ancient tigers especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan puts the comic into children's comics as "a kind of sick joke".
‘It is public regulation that if the contents were not so owned by 6 o'clock, then they had to switch to the children's program,’ said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communication, when he was asked for the transfer.
‘Pippa pig, ‘yes’.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they should work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can figure it out," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we can't figure this out until Sunday, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Threaten me, when it passed over, there were many texts going back and forth, and everyone wasn't a friend.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six that we usually do - and we tried to hand it over to our fans, and we just walked over.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "subject" because of sexuality
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that as he grew up, he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went on and on about "Not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disks presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he talked out his gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in cross-country shows, Kirsty Young, has taken months off because of sickness.
What might look like a lost in Laverne's first program, Daly said he felt "less than" all the others growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to like gutars and girls."
He said, ‘The people of this day, feeling less than and different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to lie.’
He wanted to prove that he was 'whatever', he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-gonar bronze Olympic medal has been a professional LGBT campaign and used its appearance on the Commonwealth Games of the year in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live up to no faults and wanted to give others hope.
The three-gun world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he was last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympic age 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find anyone at the same age who had experienced similar heights and downturns.
The couple were parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
'If you had asked me last year,' he said, 'all I need to do is win a gold medal.'
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his dad didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he'd asked about was if they had tickets to London 2012 when he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell you that you're not going to be in the front row," he said.
‘I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead, which I finally recognized as not overpowering,’ he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and water bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had longed for all my life to dive in in front of a home audience at an Olympic game where fans didn't feel better," he said.
It also inspired his first songset--proud of Heather Small--who had vibrated with him in the build-up of the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape sit Mickelson on the floor of Ryder Cup Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to turn his face around to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12 time, was benched by Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, which he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner splits his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game in the order of hope to correct what's bothering him.
Never most competent longscota. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is better at hitting the longshoes on the thong, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golfer isn't exactly hit.
And if the bana itself isn't skimming enough, Mickelson will meet in the 9th game on Sunday, the exact British Open Meister Francesco Molinari, who's joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games of theirs this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 single games, get to a hot start, Mickelson's fight can be absolutely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could have made a difference.
'He fully understood the role he had today,' said Furyk, 'and gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow.'
“ He has great confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's added so much to these layers in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't think he played two games.
I saw more, but that's the way it was, and that's what we thought we had to do.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup games that get played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson's got 18 sisars, 20 losses and seven halves, even though Furyk said his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
‘He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's entertaining, he likes to have fun with people and he's a good guy to keep in the team room, ’ he explained.
"I think the younger players had the fun that got in with him too, this week, which was fun to see.
He contributes much more than just to play.’
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big lease can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant rental on the way into the last days' singles of Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an uncomfortable trip.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 game on Valderrama, where a side captain of Seven Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nase with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You continue to remind yourself that we had a big rent on Valderrama; we had a big rent on Brookline, where we lost, and on Valderrama, where we water, but barely," said Bjorn, after seeing Klasssa 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday to rent 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and everyone on that team that this isn't over.
You're going to full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you have a score on the board.
We have a goal, and it's trying to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been telling you all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's over on the other side -- the biggest players in the world."
Glad to see how his players have been acting on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never put the signer on my shoes.
Tomorrow is another day.
In the morning, it's the individual achievements that come along, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you're out there individually, you're tested out fully of your golfing capacity.
It's the message you need to distribute to players; get the best out of yourself in the morning.
Now you're leaving your partner, and he's got to go get the best out of himself too.'
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite numbers Jim Furyk will be looking after his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been in both ends of the turnaround operations in the last few days, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before he quit losing when Europe pulled the Miracle of Medinah.
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, had gathered his players on their way into the last day.
“We have 12 important fights in the morning, but you want to get started on the fast start you saw on Brookline, which you saw on Medinah.
When the moment is allowed to go by, much pressure is placed on the middle games.
We're setting up our line-up corresponding to and we're setting up our mutants in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical in the morning.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to hire the fight and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the system.
‘I went with this group of gutars in this order because I think it is all the way through,’ Bjorn said about its options of singles.
Germany’s new warships again launched
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been ordered in 2014 to replace the age of Cold War warships, but it will not be there for at least the next year due to the wrong system and uncharted costs, reported local media.
Initiating Rheinland-Pfalz, the charter ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class fregates, has now been launched to the first half of 2019, following the Die Zeit newspaper, which citers a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but they worried about the problem after delivery was the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships the Navy ordered back in 2007 come as a replacement for the aldrading Bremen class frigatts.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a series of anti-planes and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to place the latest frigates for up to two years away from the males at home level.
Yet continuous delays mean that they groundbreaking warships, which supposedly allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be obsolete when they enter service, record Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a ship building after delivery.
Although the causes of the tournament were little known, the German media quoted a number of important ‘software and hardware failures’ that rendered the warship useless if they were deployed on a combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important when ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be driven by a crew of about 120 sailors -- only half the labor force on older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramaticly overweight, which reduces the performance and limits the provision of the fleet to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton 'Rheinland-Pfalz' is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in other world wars.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the price of the entire project - including crew training - will also be a problem.
It's said to have reached a dizzying 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) up from the beginning €2.2 billion (EURO)
The problem of the latest frigates becomes particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany’s fleet power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the fleet is in fact ‘almost out of distribution ships’.
The officer said the problem has been built on itself over time, because old ships were deviated, but no replacement vehicles were delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the fleet.
National Trust eavesdropping on secret lives of bats
Research carried out on an estate in the Scottish Highlands is designed to obscure the way bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipetrelles and also brown long-ears and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS plugins and volunteers will also perform mobile searches using handheld detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat calls and the species that do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale image of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, natural scientific advice for NTS, hopes to cover which habitat, natural heaths, are the most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the advantages of habitat management work such as the purchase of meadows and the best way to maintain a wooded area for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and over the United Kingdom have been significant in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeper sites and habitat/booster losses.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose risks, such as flue paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their night hunting habits, their island is still more useful than their auga deira when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect errors and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, bats take very seriously.
It has ten thirds of experts, who regularly investigate, sleepover inspections, and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on Three Estates in Dumfries and Galloway, which are home to eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats.
Property manager David Thompson says that his property is the ideal territory for them.
“ Here on Threeave we have a great area for bats, ” he said.
“We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and in other countries will help us to understand what they need to thrive on."
He underlines the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within his own jurisdictions, as it is possible that inevitably destroying a single den may kill up to 400 women's bats and young people, and possibly destroy a local community.
Bats are at peace and it is illegal to kill, plaguing or disturbing them or to destroy their heifers.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the audience to come in and help.
She said, ‘We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don’t know what their populations are like.’
Ronaldo rejects the pleas of solicitors against German magazines
Cristiano Ronaldo has selected the selected articles against him as "false news", and says that people are "seeking" by using his name.
His lawyers are suing German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus forwards have been charged with choosing an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He's being charged $375.000 to keep quiet about the incident, reported Der Spiegel on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, says to his 142 million people, only hours after the games, that the games are "false news".
'No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, five times Goldball winner goes into the camera.
‘They want to market themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be known to say my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all good, "let the player and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers intend to sue the Der Spiegel over the claims, as they have called 'an illegal report on the loss within the privacy area', according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount equal to the seriousness of the rule, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in the last year."
The alleged event is said to have found it in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where one claims to have selected her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the supposed event and told him that he was "99 per cent" a "good guy" and failed with "one per cent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had taken a photograph of the injuries in a hospital, but was later collected for an equalization because she felt “scared from retaliatory treatment” and was concerned about “being publicised”.
The 34-year-old says that she now tries to switch the city when it continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in the summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a 100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever undo 'to lose car manufacturers
Britain "would undo it forever" if the loss of its world-wide status as a car production since Brexit has been stated by business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was ‘about’ that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of limit delays in case a non-contract Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston facility - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, where 90% was exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we see production stops at our factory, ” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without any agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns about which car manufacturers win are the risks of supply chains in the event of a non-agreement of Brexit.
Toyota's production line is driven on a ‘just-in-hour’ basis, with parts arriving at every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the United Kingdom and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an appointment on March 29, interference can occur at the border which the industry says may cause delays and lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at his Derbyshire factory, said the company, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chesser's plan for future relations with the EU is "adapted online to avoid checks at the border."
'We need to have an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not just to enjoy our success today, but to seize this possibility, 'he told BBC Radio 4's day programme.
'The proof from not only Toyota, but other producers is that we absolutely need to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.'
Toyota was unable to determine how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned them that additional costs would reduce competition rates for the installation and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union Association at the plant, said that his members are more concerned with: “By my experience, when these jobs go, they never return.
A spokesperson to the government said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, winning White House.
Donald Trump's high-ranking encounter with Deputy Lawyer Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against the highest-rights nomination Brett Kavanaugh continued, said the white house on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Council, Robert Mueller, investigating Russian valance blending, links between Trump helpers and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will turn the general of the lawyers or not, endangering Mueller's self-interest, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing a call to register conversations with Trump and the possibility to remove the president using the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the white house, and it was reported that he was about to go up.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York City, was announced Thursday.
Trump said he wanted to "lead" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was scheduled to avoid crashing into the Senate Commission's grandstand where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have charged him with sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, vitna.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, which would delay a full vote from the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, showed up at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “There has been no set a date; it may be this week, but I can see that it will be delayed another week because of everything else that happens at maximum rights.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the pressure up-to-date."
Some reporters will probably take it seriously: Sanders hasn't held a press briefing for the White House since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of orientations was not due to a dissatisfaction with the TV reporter's game for the gallery, although he said, "I'm not unsatisfied that they do."
She mentioned and that direct contact between Trump and the pressure will increase.
‘The President holds more press conferences than any president has ever done before’, ho - correctly said without making any evidence of the claim. ‘We have looked at the number.’
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but “if pressure is given to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it that way, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press briefing if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump occasionally accepts questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It's unusual for the president to keep a press conference alone.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why he performed the reporters without shame and almost bizarre.
Health Secretary writes about the fear of Brexit for workers from the EU at NHS in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at NHS in Scotland to express appreciation and wish that they continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter even though there are less than six months left before Britain resigns from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to taking on the costs of applications that have status as determined for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote in follows: “During the summer, pre-actions have continued between the United Kingdom and the EU, and the expected conclusion is approaching this fall.
Yet the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no deal.
I realize this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would now like to repeat how much I appreciated the contribution to everyone, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU, and outside, have with them valuable experience and completions that strengthen and strengthen the work in the health sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at Tennessee State Tigers, went through an emergency operation after inflicting damage on the head when the team lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessean.
Principal trainer for Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that the damage was done just before the break.
"He came to the sideline and collapsed, sort of," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sidelines before they put him on a stretcher and took him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had completed surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details of the extent of the damage yet, said Harris, and added that Tennessee State is still trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore and is in her first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he was injured in Saturday's game, and is now up to 18 in total this season.
Foreign purchasers have to pay a higher document charge when they purchase their own property in the United Kingdom
Unforeseen buyers are required to pay a higher document charge when they purchase their own property in the United Kingdom. The extra revenues are to be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans for conservatives.
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success by attracting young voters.
Increases in Document Charges will be added for those that do not pay taxes in Great Britain
The treasury expects a raise of up to £120 million a year - to help them out.
Theresa May wants to announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document charge when they purchase the property in Britain. The extra revenues will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be viewed as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn in attracting young tasters with the promise of offering reasonable settlements.
Increases in the document fees will be added to individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the extra money will strengthen the government’s desire to reduce the number of migrants.
The charge, added to the current document charge, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago in the second and third stages of the city, may be as much as 3 percent.
The treasury expects that the decision will bring in up to £120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside Britain, resulting in higher prices and more difficult for first - time buyers to get into the city market.
Many well-standing areas in the country - especially in the capital - have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spent most of their time in other countries.
This new policy comes only after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the document fees to help several young people buy their first home.
He charged a large construction company to keep prices up by getting their hands on self-doms, but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on affordable settlements to fix Britain’s 'burstadskam'.
Corbyn has announced a series of iaugeous proposals for city reformers, including the controlled rental and termination of the exhibitions for no reason.
He will and advise greater power to build new settlements.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bring back the British Draum - that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the broken block yard.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
Even so, it may not be as simple for individuals who do not live in Britain, or abroad, to buy settlements as it is for hardworking British builders.
Too many people have the drag of their own town too far away, and the audomy of being a stray is real.
Jack Ross, "My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland."
The head of Sunderland, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to manage Scotland at some point.
The Scot (42) is struggling with the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. They are currently in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series of last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-land fight, and that's it, Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
‘But I woke up to see Scotland on Hamden with my father, and it has always been something that has drawn me back.
That possibility can only come if I am successful as a club manager.’
Ross' handlers like Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former director of Alloa Athletic says he hasn't been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he's previously turned down approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I can 'get this club back in the Premier League."
Based on the structure and the facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong at home in the Premier League, he said.
'It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club back there.'
Ross is only three years into his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager of Dambarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' training apparatus.
He then helped Alloa to recover from the descent to the third level, and transformed St Mirren, who was on his way down, to the championship winner of the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did when he was a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a road gap," he says about leading Alloa.
“I thought being a manager would suit me a lot better than being a player.
The most bizarre of all, because I did well, lit up well and enjoyed it relatively well.
But gambling can be tough.
There's a lot of things you're just gonna have to get through every week.
I still mark it when it comes to stress and pressure with the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be the manager, and now I am the most comfortable thing I've ever felt in my own body in my adult life."

Summer’s heat wave has led to an inflammation in Britain’s struggling pubs, but it has increased the pressure on restaurant windows.
In July the saddle increased by 2.7 percent in child rearing - but in the restaurant business it decreased by 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Peter Martin, director of statistics, said: “The continued sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the pattern of June where pubs increased 2.8 per cent, only that restaurants became even more rough.
The rate of 1.8 percent in the restaurant business only got worse in July.
Pubars and barars, which are seals, made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubar as a seal of food, the decline in the sun, although not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It might seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking room had increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food had dropped 3 percent.
Paul Newman, analitics for travel and leisure at RSM, said: “The results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, as well as the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to halls in the nightlife industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still struggle. A 4.8 - percent drop in the saddle will be painful to get at the top of a high cost pressure.
The long, warm summer could not come at a worse time for food-processing operators. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can give a much longer breathing space.'
The total salsauking across pubs and restaurants, including neo-opting, was 2.7 percent in July, which reflected the tapering of brand products.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sals monitor for the British pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups that have a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is the reference index of the established industry.
One in five children has secret profiles on social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers shows a survey
Examination of 20,000 students at further stages reveals a false Insta increment
This news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a head profile they show parent
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media profiles that they keep secret to the Vatican.
A survey of 20,000 students at advanced school revealed a powerful insurrection in fake Insta profiles - a reference to the Instagram image-sharing platform.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile head profile they refer to parents, while they also have private profiles.
A mother turning over the secret page to her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "valdify me".
The research done by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmisters' Conference (HMC) on different school levels found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s unsettling that so many teenagers are trying to set up sites on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them. ”
Eilith Doyle becomes the Voice of Atletane in the Scottish Board of Sports
Eilith Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish track as non-managing director at the annual general meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most decorated track athlete in Scotland, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a major opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from current international-level experience over the past decade.
‘Eilidh has a great deal of respect across Scotland, the United Kingdom and the World's track society, and we are sure that the field in Scotland can benefit from getting it into the board,’ said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm eager to act as a voice for the performers, and I'm hoping to be able to help and help the sport in Scotland."
The American, which has gold from both 200 m and 400 m in Atlanta in 1996 among its four Olympic golds and now is a regular guest at the BBC, was unable to go for a drip.
On Twitter he wrote: “Today it is a month since I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Legane said it was only time that could tell me if I was going to be okay or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've completely recovered, learned to walk again, and today I'm making flexibility jams!
Thank you for the encouraging messages."
Internet split m units about breast pump advertising that compares mothers with milk cow
A breast pump company has split public opinion on the Internet using an ad that compares caring mothers with milking cows.
To mark what's described as "the world's first silent, on its own breast pump", the technology company Elvie released a little-freaked ad inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump provides mothers who are extracting milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a high-filled barn of cows to a song that includes text like, "Yes, I'm meeting myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you don't notice, this isn't specter, it's my boobs."
The chorus goes on, "Pump it out, pump it out, I'll feed these children, pump it out, pump it out, I'll shovel it out my ladies."
On the other hand, the advertising, published on the company Facebook page, has created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers, and many victories it illuminates "frightened" in the dairy industry.
“ Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that the calves are trusted from only days after birth, ” writes one.
Elvie breast pump sit discreetly in a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Understandingly traumatic for both mother and child
But, yeah, why don't they use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their kids?"
Another added: ‘What a rhombus-distant advertisement!’
Others defended the ad, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "fun."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I wouldn't have had one if I still did.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This ad's a little crazy, but I got him for what he is.
This is a genius product", wrote a single one.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial directed toward mothers who pump (often at work or in toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not a commercial that boasts or judges the dairy industry.’
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they all danced with the discreet pump wrapped in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is very quiet, has no clothes or pipes, and its discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, which gives women freedom to move, to hold their young, and even to go out while they're pumping.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: “Elvie-pumpa is such a revolutionary product that there is a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers that extract milk and milk cows, we wanted to set spotlights on breast pumping and challenges related to this, and at the same time demonstrate the unlikely freedom fate of the new pump, in a subtly and recognisable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium to design Marta Jakubowski, while she used the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved quietly to camp on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in prison has peaked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the strict policy introduced by the Trump administration makes it harder to place their children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up to a child can threaten their own potential to stay in the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be satisfied to submit fingerprints, and that these data will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement for Congress, said that the Bureau has arrested dozens of people who have applied to sponsor single minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arrests had nothing on their criminal record before.
‘More than 80 per cent of those who are either sponsors or members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're gonna keep going after these people, Albence said.
Following the additions to the camp, new rules have now been introduced to handle the children. The rules require some of them to go to court before a month has passed, towards the previous 60 days.
Many people will participate through video calls and not during personal visits, to have their case tried to conduct an immigration judgment.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely it is that they develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to selected breaks or escapes, say they added them to the camp. Reports that have appeared in the last few months are the same.
Spokesmen say that these concerns are greater in large installations such as Tornillo. Because of the size of the facility, it is more likely to be ignored that children toil.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or say goodbye to veins, can intensify trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria is asking American, French, and Turkish chiefs of occupation to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also requested that Syrian refugees come home, even if the country is now at war in the 18th year.
Moualem, who serves as deputy prime minister, said that advancing forces were caught illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of combating terrorism and "will be dealt with from it".
"They must withdraw their eyes immediately and without duty," he said to the audience.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their heima.
He said that Damascus will continue to ‘fight a battle until all Syrian territories have become reinsa’ for both terrorist groups and the ‘illegal presence of the future’.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that war-inhabited country.
In the case of refugee problems, Moualem said that it was safe for them to return, and he blamed “some Western countries” for having “rapid fears” about the environment that kept the refugees away.
‘Me have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return,’ he said.
‘They create policies out of what should be a purely humanitarian problem.’
The United States and the EU have been warned that restoration in Syria will be of no help until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
U.N. diplomats claim that a newly created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel fortification, has created a potential to continue pushing forward political conversations.
The Russian Turkish treaty has launched a massive attack by the Russian rebush, Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem underlined that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that military action will be directed against jihadistar, including warriors from the Nusrafront, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be extinguished."
The United Nations Emissary, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to gather the first meeting of a new committee of a cabinet and opposition member to prepare a postwar law for Syria, and pave the way to the election.
Moualem states the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the Committee, and says that the work of the panel should be limited "to review the articles of the current Constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump is going to win one more term.
With that logic, Trump will win the election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the presidency will have an early end because of scandals and impeachment.
It would certainly be "the most dramatic ending to a presidency ever."
At the moment of writing, there are no characters to show that the viewers have become bored.
Since 2014 CNN has completed its best-time rating at 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has a doctor on top of the cable racing with as much as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are being lured by, because there's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer in the ABC drama, "Designed Survivor," dealing with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Congressional Building.
Nell Scovell, old comedy author and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Smoking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
It remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 option.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
Why would she do that?
“Because he makes me laugh, ” he replied, according to Scovell.
It's the entertainment value of the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the history of Roe v. Wade, Washington, can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get to be together again and whole into the global economy.
Turning it off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed Citizen of State when you find yourself in the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of sources with "dep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort say the bomb jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 ("a garment thick with arrogance", said the Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's unsolicited description of Trump's, eh, anatomy.
Personally, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he's doing that gets to feel like a reality show, is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily suffering at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawnee Stars, about the show that goes with Trump's employees and day-to-day disputes (entering a fight with the NFL, Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, or you won't be around anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sunny outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat inside and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't wriggle away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Commission and the future of maximum right was hanging by a thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization', told Fleiss.
'I thought it was a joke, but it turns out that they were right.'

Money from the outside currents into the tightest intermediate game
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees an abundance of money, thanks to a change of territory in Congress that led to two sittin' members fighting for the same seat.
Recently, the suburban district of Pittsburg presents Democratic representative Conor Lamb as watering his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, republicar Keith Rothfus, today representative of the previous 12th district of Pennsylvania, who greatly overlaps with the new 17th district.
Maps were redrawn after the January most high rights in Pennsylvania determined that the old territories were illegally formed to benefit the Republicans.
Concursa concerning the 17th district has launched an arms drag for the financing of the Cambodians, between the major parties their monetary, the Democratic Congressional Congress and the Republican Congress.
Lamb became a known name in Pennsylvania, following a button sign in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional district.
The seat had been heard to be a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump had watered the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a little advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador because of support for China but withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing without any negative reaction from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama for his partners tossing Trump organization out their hired team.
The Prime Ministers decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama over the 'last fences to recognize Taiwan no longer', said Heather Nauert, the Minister's spokeswoman, in an outlying early this month.
But punishment was only assessed against El Salvador, who received an estimated 140 million dollars in American aid in 2017, including for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted limits for visas, would be painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
Since internal meetings developed, officials of North America and Central America postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was considered a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid - September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue and thus put a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet with the conference, which has been planned in the middle of October, as a signal of the relevance that the administration places on the collection, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outside analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the heading of anonymity.
Study History
One waits for Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice, for which there is now significant evidence in the Public Protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller has turned his attention in the investigation against Trump's campaign conspiring with Russia's ideira attack on our election.
If Congress were to change co-pilots, Trump would have to be brought to justice in this body, in what he's preparing to overturn the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
It's a lot of square about, and I don't mean to imply that Trump's fall is inevitable - nor for his counterpart in Europe.
There is an option to consider all of us on both sides of the pond, which will affect the length of the game.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood up to him and helped Czechlovakane in Munich.
We failed, and missed out on an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that resulted.
The course of history revolves around such a turning point, and democracy’s impertinent marches are carried out.
Americans face several of these turning points now.
What would we do if Trump kickar showed justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in deep water since this newspaper revealed that last year he suggested that he listen to the president in secret and speculated that he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How would we react if the recent FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or he is accepted by the highest level of legitimacy despite allegations of sexual assault and indiscretion?
And above all, will we vote for a congress that holds Trump responsible?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're wrong because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country in which I have my embassy.
She survived, immigrating to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light the Sabbath light on the table that asks the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic before meeting Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, they will give them a good start to qualify from group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfield player Graham Dorrans from making his first performance this season before the 2-2 score against Villarreal, but he thinks the Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone for larger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
‘We went into the fight with the idea that we could get something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could take it at the end, but all in all, it's probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
On Thursday, it's still gonna be a big European night.
Hopefully, we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, and they got a good result in their last fight, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
In the last year, it's definitely been hard, with everything that's happened to my injuries and the changes to the club, but now everything's okay.
The stable is good and the gums thrive; the exercise is good.
Hopefully we can run now, put the past season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in a search had cleared tanks of how they would be cared for, few talked to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a survey by the insurance company Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long - term care.
Only 10% said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says the vice president of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here you go.
Talk to your spouse and young ones: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Cooperate with a counselor and your family to discuss how and how you will be cared for, since these options may be a big part of determining the costs.
Collect an Financial Adviser: Your adviser may also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The long-term financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with cash value to help pay the expenses, or insurance yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have money.
Make legal document: Defer legal battles before they begin.
Get a health authorisation in place, so that you can identify a person you trust to oversee your medical care and to ensure that professional actions are in line with your wishes in case you cannot communicate.
You can also consider a letter of access for your finances.
You should select a person you trust to take off financial fences and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the ability to pay them yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your aged parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer any questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all of these details in a given plan, so you're ready.
"It is not only about the finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
‘ What kind of medication is it?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."

Indonesian Earthquakes and Tsunamis
At least 384 people are killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, victory is being carried out by public officials. The speech of death is expected to increase.
Without communication capability, helper workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of the Palu epicenter of the quake that had a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was sweeping its 40th anniversary at the quake and the tsunami hit.
Donggala is an area that extends over 300 km of coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farm operations are the Berbarn of the economy of the central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is important in the province, but it's mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been threshed by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, following the Indonesian disaster reduction agency.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is lying in the seismic ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean, becoming the lash of earthquakes.
Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in the last few years:
2004: A large quake on the west coast of the Aceh Province in northern Sumatra on December 26, triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A number of large quakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 - magnitude quake hit the south of Java, the most popular Indonesian island, and triggered a tsunami that crashed onto the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 quake hit near the city of Padang, capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake hit one of Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of about 10 metres that islanded dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small quake hit the Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives because of buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great quakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The island shook thousands of buildings and temporarily left thousands of tourists on the beach.
Sarah Palin's oldest zone was arrested and charged at home.
Track Palin, the oldest zone of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by the Alaskan State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of being held in his home, interfering with the reporting of the home police, and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he picked up the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to call the police to report the violation of the law.
Palin will be in custody in the Mat-Su prison, held on bail $500, reported KTU.
He appeared in court Saturday and, when asked, declared himself not to be incubated, abandoned the network.
Palin is facing three Class A misbehaviors, which means he can be jailed for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He's also been charged with a class B misbehavior that can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault in his home, interfering with a reporting by the home office and holding a weapon while he was intoxicated in relation to the event.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit her in the duck.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups after linking the zone with her selected behaviour to PTSD as an ancestor from when he was serving in Iraq.
Indonesia’s Earthquakes and Tsunamis: Hundreds Lost Their Lives
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, at a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are down, and the number of casualties is expected to rise the next few days.
The quake hit just outside the central Sulawesi, located at the northeast of Jakarta capital.
Videos showing the dramatic eye of the quake are rife on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want the death penalty on suspicion in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a soulful punishment that hasn't been executed for a federal violation in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) is said to have used a home Depot rental car to carry out an attack on a west side highway on the lower Manhattan in October, where he ran down pedestrians and cyclists on the way.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "on purpose" and that he intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm on them, following a note filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these events may be the reason for the possible death penalty, stated in the legal document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder with targets for extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in relation to organized crime, and a charge for selected and destroying motor-run equipment.
The attack called for "substantial planning and deliberateness," said the prosecutors and the seductive way Saipov carried out the attack as "disgusting, cruel and corrupt".
‘Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to familiar and the veins of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco’, the note states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York has judged the death penalty on a case.
That charge, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
On June 19, 1953, both were located in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months that followed, following legal documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was best known, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, says the prosecutor.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, the police said.
He hasn't made a clean statement on all counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says that they are the "significant drawer" with the decision of prosecutorship.
‘We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty rather than accept a declaration of death for life in prison without possible release will only prolong the traum of the event for all involved,’ said Patton.
The defenders of Saipov had previously told the prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Parliament member of Tory's meiner Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" today, during a protest at the Tory Country Summit.
The former author of the British Independent Party said that the police officers had to “felt the pressure ” of the Europeans, as one of Theresa May’s members suggested that he hire the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, meinical member of parliament Peter Bone told the protestants in Birmingham that the United Kingdom had been out now, if Farage was Brexit Minister.
With the challenge May is faced with reconciliation of its deep split lines has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories as wishes to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggles to maintain plan with the Chequers compromise on the right track of attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The Allies insist that she will press to make a deal with Brussels, despite its setbacks – and force Euroskeptics and the Labour Party to choose between the package it will and "caos".
Bone told Leave Means Leave classification in Solihull that he wanted to throw away Chequers.
He suggested that Farage should be of noble rank and be in charge of negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had steered, we would have been out now," he said.
The Parliament member from Wellingborough added: "Eg will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: “Me didn’t fight world wars to be inferior.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone rejects the claim that the people’s performance has changed since the 2016 option: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to become is completely false’.
Brexit champion of Tory, Andrea Jenkyns, also participated in the march.
"Chequers isn't popular in the population, the opposition won't vote for it, it's not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please, drop the Chequers and listen."
In a message directed towards May, it adds: 'State Ministers are managing their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Farage said that police officers need to know the heat if they're going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“No, it is about trust between us - the people - and the political class, ” he said.
'They seek to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that 'me will not let them get away with it.'
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want you to make the political cluster, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
"We mobilize the people's army in this country that gave us a ring in Brexit and won't rest until we've become an independent, self-ruled, proud Britain.
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before they held a two - hour meeting downtown.
A handy activist fan of Tories Against Brexit after launching the group this weekend.
Labour fellow Lord Adonis made fun of the conservatives for security problems they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
‘This is the public that tells us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus, for a frictionless limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland’, he added.
'It is a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plan to take a nice look at the presidential election
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren's victory will take a "one good look at running for president" after the November election.
Boston Globe reports that the Democrat of Massachusetts was talking about his future at a town meeting in west Massachusetts Saturday.
Warren, a regular critter of President Donald Trump, recaptures in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but a member of the board of Trump’s campaign in Massachusett in 2016.
It has been the center of too much speculation that it might try Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday was 36th session of voters in a town hall since Trump was added.
An attendee asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "that women go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."

At 11:00 a.m. local time, the police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shootings on Friday and asked for help to identify a man on the video clip.

In the end, Simpson admitted he was in the city, with a gun, and admitted that he was going out Wayde Sims.

"Russian Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton is nearing the world title "after the lagords give their name over Sebastian Vettel."
It became clear from that moment on that Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders would have a big role in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start in the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in what he defended his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the depot and let Hamilton get into traffic at the back of the trail, which should be determined.
The Mercedes ran into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton harbored ahead after a little action side-by-side that caused the Ferrari driver to let the inside be free in order not to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstapp started, on his 21st birthday, in the rear row and low in the 7th place at the end of the first round.
After that, he suffered much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of passing Kimi Raikson as low in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but couldn't speed up the last eight rounds while the Raikgon got fourth.
It's a hard day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both the first and the second, said Hamilton.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting Saturday due to the insinuation that she did not lock the letter from Christine Blasey Ford where she charges Max-nominated Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in Western Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but commented that what goes in the Senate showed that people were "smear and horrible and spoke untrue".
"The one thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and uncomfortable and talk untrue," he said.
‘When you look at publications and leaks and then say ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I did not do it.’
Remember your dive?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lay it?
Do you remember the answer at this time... did you record the document - "Oh, uh, what?"
Oh, no.
I do not display it.’
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't, he added, and he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was played earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
'I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, 'I didn't plant historia,' said Feinstein to the committee, following The Hill.
'She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as requested.'
But the denial is not falling into good soil with the president, who commented on it at Saturday's valentine: "I win dive, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
As he continues to defend the highest-righted, who has been charged with the low sexual behaviour of three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
‘They are determined to take back their power in every way they see necessary.
You see the bad, the bad, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, said the president of the Mediaite.

The beaches from Dundee compensated for the loss on the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return game 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants were given an early two-target lead because of the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillener.

Pilot loses his life to ensure that hundreds of airplanes escape earthquakes
A Indonesian flyer is howled as a hero after losing his life in what he continues to ensure that an airplane with hundreds of passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are slow after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in the wreckage of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post at the control tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even if it turned wildly.
He stayed behind to make sure that the plane that was on the roller coaster, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News Australia.
We send a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a major hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he went away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
He added, "This is a heart-crusting thing."
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of casualties will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis management agency says that access to small towns in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
'The number of dead people increases while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach' said the bureaucologist Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] have destroyed Palu, which is scheduled for a mass funeral on Sunday.
Naudress is coming in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35 - year - old mother, said to Sky News: “Court minute comes an ambulance with more bodies.
It's hard to find clean water.
Small shops have been robbed.’
Jan Gelfand, the teacher of the Red Crosset in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the surviving, but we don’t know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the military in the country: “I ask everyone to work around the clock to do everything they can to help with the evacuation.
"Are they clear?" CNN reported.
Indonesia suffered from earthquakes in Lombok earlier this year, and 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini reports the no man Sakna after lagoon flight crash
The airline that operated on a plane crash in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, reports that a man is slow after saying before that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that from Saturday afternoon they do not know where the manly passenger is.
The airline said they're working with local authorities, hospitals and aftersaw to find the man.
The airline did not provide any more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped to rescue other passengers and crews after the plane threshed as it tried to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven people have been sent to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and they were all stable.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Someone thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was low.
"It was extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers were able to wade through the water, which reached them to life, to the nauds on the plane before it sank.
He said that the flight crew was panicking and screaming, and he suffered a major injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said that nearby seals, which worked on a dock, also saved passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers ashore before the plane sank about 100 feet [30 m].
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in the crash of PNG registered airlines in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Anallytics make the timeline of the night when a woman was born alive.
The prosecution presented all the evidence of Saturday under the appeal of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department analactics Paul Rowlett vitna for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he put together cell phone recordings to find out what happened the night Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant Quinton Tellis (29).
According to the newspaper The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett told him that he used location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was dead when Chambers died, countering what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data revealed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers' mobile phone at the same time that he said he was with the friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford Vitna on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said that he was “laug, because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he'd known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers died, Telli's messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information were deleted from his mobile phone.
Hale said, "He has erased her from his life."
The defense is closing the case on Sunday.
Dommaren said he expects the trial to go to the jury later that day.

Another black person?!
New York childcare services sue couples for fired after "racist" text message
A New York childcare worker sues a couple to fire her on discrimination after she got a wrong text message from her mother who complained that it was "another black person".
The couple have denied that they are racist and compared the lawsuit with ‘extreme’.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was unhappy when she saw that the babysitter she had added, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work for the first time in 2016.
‘NEEEEEEEEI, ENDA EIN ANSWER PERSON,’ wrote Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to the man.
But instead of sending the message to the man, he sent it to the child care worker Maurice, twice.
After realizing the mistake, the unadapted Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, and said that the previous childcare worker, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now he wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for firing her. She wants $350 a day for the job she should have had for six months, even if it was uncontracted, where she should stay with the family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she said to The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they're racists and said that firing Maurice was the only thing they could do after insulting her, by the people they were afraid she might get revenge.
“My wife had sent something to her that she didn’t want to see.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,' husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"Would you let someone you've offended look after your children, even if you didn't want to insult them?
Your new-born baby?
Think of it."
Plasco compared the lawsuit with the blackmail and said that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a “very difficult situation”.
‘Are you really going to go after a person in such a situation?
That's not a nice thing to do," said the investor Plasco.
As the case goes, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers behind the Paddington books were afraid that people wouldn't like a talking bear, revealing a new letter.
The daughter of author Michael Bond, born shortly after the first book was approved, commented: “It is hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very amusing to know now how successful Paddington was."
Jankel said that his father, who works as a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected, and she added that she had mixed feelings under her book's 60th anniversary, because my father died last year.
When it comes to Paddington, described as “one of the most important members of the family, ” she added that her father was proud inside of his success.
"He was a rather quiet man, and he never lied," she said.
‘But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you are proud of them even though you are not really responsible.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was supposed to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
When she was taken to the hospital at Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice in a hurry, where doctors labored in vain to save their lives.
'Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was gonna make it,' said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you, dear.
I'm coming soon to be with you.
I'll be there soon.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her pumping were slowly coming out of her system.
She had already died and now her body was about to shut down.
I just said there, knowing that this happened.
I couldn't howl or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to hold everything in.’
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who now mourned the loss of his daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who did not know what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
And said, “O you people, I have sat with your heads bent and your tears fall.”
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning women hang notes on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been attaching notes to a bridge in Wales that's supposed to inspire and get people who think of taking suicides to change their minds and call the number on the sticky notes.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and killed himself when he was 18.
‘I do not want any parent to feel as I know me every day.’
Davis, who is 45 years old and caged in Lydney, said that the zone was a talented chef with a smile like that.
“ Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms."
But before he died, he quit his job because he was in a real dark place.
In 2014, Tyler’s 11 - year - old brother was the first to find Tyler after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that the younger brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the note notes "for people to know that there are other people out there who care and they can talk to, even if there's a friend.
Don't sit there and talk to anyone.'
Humphreys, who has been the friend of Davis for many years, lost his partner after Mark had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me that he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he began to behave differently.
He was in the boiler emotionally on Christmas Day, when the children opened their riddles, he didn't see them at once."
She told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continue to work through the trauma: “There is a huge void in our family now.
We're fucked up.
But we must all fight to do so."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance while the FBI starts the investigation.
‘I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he was asking about — a limited investigation — we might be able to achieve a bit of ensemble,’ said Flake on Saturday, adding that he is afraid of the Committee ‘fell together’ in the middle of a partisan lock.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The midterms in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans do not do well, this will make it difficult for them to choose Kavanaugh in the U.S. High Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who works at the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley like that, then has been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They're going to blow the Senate, choir 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 weasels in the Senate, with 50 weasels, Mike Pense, the Vice President of the United States, can give him the last weasel and confirm him in the highest court.
Number of defectors in North Korea "decreasing" under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean law.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Department of Unit and said there were 1,127 defectors last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that strings bordering between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling fees are the main reasons why the number has declined.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of defectors from North Korea are given South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most people fly through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China sees defectors as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, and often sends them back by force.
The relations between North and South Korea — which are technically still at war — have improved in recent months.
This month the laymen of the two countries of Pyongyang met to negotiate the disarming of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they became single to work for a nuclear Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean foreign ministers, Ri Yong-ho U.S.A., were responsible for achieving nothing since then.
'Unless to be able to trust the United States we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first,' said Ri in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he can't quell the High Court
The Minority Leiare Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the High Court, and said that he has too much temper for the American High Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
‘I know that if a woman had acted that way, it had been called 'hysterical', Pelosi said of the testimony of Kavanaugh rather than the Senate Court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening speech to Kavanaugh, he was very emotional and cried out at times with a lump in his throat as he spoke about his family and his years went on.
He criticized the Democratic Committee and called the charges against him "grossian and planned assassination of his reputation," organized by liberal police officers who were angry that Hillary Clinton didn't water the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't take the high court because it shows that he's prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think the way he acted disqualifies him and what he said about the Clintons and Democrats," she said.
Pelosi objected when she was asked to try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the High Court, and if the Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.
'I can tell you this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't sit in court, nor in court he gets now,' added Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is the Dommar of Washington, D.C., his federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she's concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh versus law known as Obamacare and the Roe vs. Wade case, because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
In his earrings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions if he would turn certain fences in the high court.
'It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the high court to expect us to say he's great,' said Pelosi.
And women have to swing their swords
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cried when we were angry," Steinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
It goes on, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high corporate position, who said that she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You think I'm sorry because I greed.
I am angry.’
And then it just goes on and on.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears act as a way to get the anger out, but many misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories of a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I burst out of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me by the neck -- she was a cold man that I had always been terrified of -- and dragged me out in the hallway.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
'They don't know you're raging.
They think you are sorry and that they are watered because they made you weep."
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a congresswoman, a Democrat of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught out on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, in frustration, thought she might as well run for president herself.
"I had not really thought it through enough," she said to me while laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates running for elections, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Something called the "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" situation.
Since the campaign had already been going on for some time, she had not collected enough money, so she promised that it would only be quiet if she was able to collect $2 millinar.
It was impossible.
It discovered that the support players paid her $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
'Do they dare to give me a discount?' they asked.
When she declared that she wasn't going to run for office anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so hard to collect money and aim for the rats instead of the delegates, and anger against gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
“You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” said Schroeder about how the press reacted when it branched.
‘You should have thought Kleenex was my master sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
"Handed branch"?
How the Trade War between the United States and China May Be Good for Beijing
Opening habits in the trade war between the United States and China were edgy, and while the battle continues, a tear between the two countries can be an advantage to Beijing in the long run, say experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump was first in line this year to treasure important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on articles worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken hemn and set tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the U.S. for every shot they take off, and the second largest economy in the world is probably not going to end soon.
To get Washington to stop, China must do what the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, the American pressure can have a positive effect on the long - term Chinese economy by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
‘The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to go under is far beyond what people have dared to admit before, ’ said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a thought tank forge.
Syria ready for the return of refugees, victory of the Foreign Minister.
Syria says that they are ready to receive refugees who will return voluntarily and ask for help to rebuild the country that is destroyed after more than seven years in war.
When he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that relations in the country are progressing.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terror," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal areas.
All levels are now in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country in which they had to travel from terrorism and one-sided economic measures beyond the daily life and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have flown from the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Additional six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to take in help to rebuild the broken country.
However, he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help with terms from countries sponsoring the rebellion.
Europe secures herrings in Ryder Cup, Paris
The European made water Ryder Cup 2018 when they beat the American team with a 165 - to 10.5 finish score in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown of the Danish captain’s team, Thomas Bjørn, to the 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, beat up most of the tournament, hit the ball in the water from the tee at Holes 16, Par 3, and so gave the signer to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players that ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current size in 1979.
Jordan Spieth, an American, was knocked out by 5/4 players with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Bear Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 by English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has shared in eight Ryder Cjell, became the most successful European with 25.5 points in his career.
‘Ordinarily, I couldn’t do it, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so, so glad to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia according to the European signer.
He's making the baton out to the countryman John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2/1 in single Sunday.
"I know a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I wake up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four fights in France, and now has a record of 13-21-3 I Ryder Cup up through his career.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, which has won 14 major titles and has only been disabled by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who were impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the U.S. captain, commented on a disappointing display from his team. “ I’m proud of these mutants, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a single-minded captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our Ryder Cup committee and get on with it.
I love these 12 mutants and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We were frigid."
