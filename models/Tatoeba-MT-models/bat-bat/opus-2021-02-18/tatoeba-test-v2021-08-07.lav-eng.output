When an English-speaking person notices that a foreigner with whom he speaks does not understand something he said, he repeats exactly the same thing, but loudly as this person would be a deaf. At no time he does not remember that his choice of words could be complicated, or that his expression could be easily understood by a foreigner, and that he could say it more simply with other words. As a result, a person not only still understands what he says, but also becomes irritated by the fact that he is considered deaf.
