He was almost asleep.

Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the board.
She accepted him with joy.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like him talking.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I've learned a lot of it.
He killed that man.
Don't expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the gate.

Don't leave now, we're going to eat lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old brainless man.
Eat your bread!

I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come here.
Women change the world.
Singapore spying on the floor is a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.

Evil sometimes wins.
Tom has already taken three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?

Please just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I talked to my friends.
All your cats are grey.
And now I remember the times when we made up with you ascending.
When we're going to sleep, we're saying "good night."
Scandal destroyed his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy bread.
I suggest that you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong in that.
If you invite him, he is likely to come.
I know you know I know.
Go home six years ago.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candles lighted the room.

Tom couldn't stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't miss the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
When should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new shop.
Everybody knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where are you living in Turkey?
Tom's gone.
I can't.
Get out of class.
On my mother's take-off, three dogs.

No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I've got ten-five.
Her hat looked funny.
She's too young to understand that.

Look at the book on the table.

What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that green fish.
Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?

I got inside the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I got a white cat.
He immediately wrote our names.
Our son died during the war.
It is an unsatisfactory result.

This idea is very attractive.
They go shopping.
Everything that is genius is simple.

I wrote a long letter to her.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to make mistakes.
Be careful, okay?

These clothes are suitable for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?

Can you go with us?
I don't care about him.
Tom could not find a reason why he needed to go home early.
Get your hand up.
He didn't sell home.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I don't think you'd be busy.
Where's Mary?
The new treaty allows us to demand what we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go open the door.
I told you that I would hire more than every time later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs it more than he needs it.
Have fun!
