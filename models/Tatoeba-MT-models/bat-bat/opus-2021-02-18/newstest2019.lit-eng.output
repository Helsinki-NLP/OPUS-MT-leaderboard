At the 11th meeting of the MG Baltic case court on Monday, all accused persons: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing began with evidence from the accused.
Alexander Doroševas, the new lawyer appointed by the State at the previous hearing, said to the College of Judges, who had not yet been able to get acquainted with the file.
At that time, MG Baltic lawyer Linas Belevičius stated that in order to ensure full protection of a person, the Chamber of Judges should allow the new lawyer to have access to the file and requested the court hearing.
"In order to ensure the protection of the person, he must be familiar with the criminal file.
It is not just a formal sitting," Mr Belevičius said.
The new lawyer, A. Doroševas, noted that he was not able to know either the accused act or all the material of the case.
At the previous hearing, the suspect Mr Gustainis announced that he had refused his lawyer because he would no longer be able to pay him.
The hearing also included sound recordings.
The accused lawyers misled the fact that the sound records submitted to the court were of poor quality.
The legal protection suspects that the policy has supported or initiated decisions favourable to the group in the Seimas and other state institutions by taking brittles from MG Baltic, and has also influenced the awarding of public contracts by ELTA.
Over 150 people were interviewed in the inquiry, more than 50 of which were members of the Seimas, several former ministers, Members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 cheats were carried out.
It is suspected that S. Gustainis received more than EUR 8 thousand, G. Steponavičius - EUR 15 thousand, V. Gapšys - more than EUR 27 thousand E. Masiulis is suspected of taking over EUR 106 000.
The Labour Party is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, Liberals' conscience - bribery, trade and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of the effects of buying and selling these parties.
It is suspected that the politicians had consulted on the bribery with Vice President Kurlianskis of the MG Baltic Group and later proposed or supported initiatives favourable to the group in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics guards: Liberals' Consensus Board on the Right of Action of Vilnius Division
"The decisions taken by the Governing Board are in accordance with the statutes," the BNS announced after the meeting of the commission its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas.
"Our decision wasn't something new.
Explanation as a commission has already been made in July when the question of Pagages and Utena was raised.
Then we said that, according to the statutes, this is a matter of competence for the board.
And if the Management Board decides that some departments may act as they wish - to go with the Committee and the Management Board to agree, then the Division may go, but if the Board decides that there will be a participatory lists everywhere, which the Board has adopted, then it is a decision that all the departments should make part lists.
And if you do not agree with the Board, then there is an opportunity to suspend membership and to go with the committee," he added.
According to Mr Tamošiūn, the party's board will now decide on further action.
On October 17, the Liberals' Union Board of the Party annulled the decision of Vilnius City Department to participate in municipal elections, not with the list of the party, but a new sailing electoral committee.
In the opinion of the Board of the Party, the decision of the liberals of the capital to participate in the elections in the form of a public electoral committee infringed the statutes of the party, the decisions of the board.
Until October 31, Vilnius department had to cancel its intentions to participate in municipal elections with the list of committees.
But the chapter did not.
Former Head of the Division, Aušrinis Armonaitė has already left the Liberals' conscience.
The Mayor of Vilnius, the former President of the Liberals' Union Remigijus Simasius, who promises to pursue another term of office of the head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public electoral committee "On Vilnius, which we are proud of!".
He left the party too.
Elections of municipal councils and mayors will take place next year.
The rural population in Northern India has cut a tiger, which had previously dragged one man, and the officials reported on Monday.
The forest care officer Mahavir Kaujlagi (Mahavir Kaudžlagi) said that the man who worked in the field was dressed late on Sunday, the villages surrounded the beast and, while trying to get out of the female, cut it with a tractor.
The residents say that about 10 days ago this tiger also attacked and insured one young man.
The village is located in the Dudhva tiger discipline in the Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km south-east of the capital of the State of Utar Pradesh Laknau.
Prohibition of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Director of the Disciplinary Ramesha Pandey said that the case would be notified to the police under the Wild Nature Protection Act.
In April, the villages in the state of Utar Pradesh in Nighasan were killed another tiger, which was in serious injuries.
Tiger is a Indian national animal; under the Wild Nature Protection Law, tigers are considered to be a endangered species.
Last year’s government figures show that during the last three years, at least one person died daily during the collisions with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with the tigers are gradually increasing since the 1980s, when India launched a programme for the protection of tigers, under which the disciplinary regimes were established in national parks and the galabia of the big cats started to be a crime.
Despite changes in the calculation methods of tigers, the census would show that the then population of approximately 1 800 tigers increased to 2 226 individuals in 2014.
Compulsory labelling of cats and dogs by microschemes is proposed
The Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Law on Animal Welfare and Protection, proposing the mandatory marking of subcutaneous microschemes for cats and dogs.
"We propose that cats and dogs must be labelled by subcutaneous microschemes and their registration and labelling should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be labelled free of charge with state funds and cats in 2020, so citizens will not be concerned and costs will be covered by specially foreseen public funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the law aim at resolving the systemic need for the labelling of pets.
This is expected to avoid problems caused by non-responsible breeders, illegal reproducers or sellers.
It is provisionally assessed that the expected average cost of the micro-scheme and the provision of the service, which will reach around EUR 5, will be compensated for all owners of animals during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling for all pet animals may be up to EUR 6 million.
It is planned that the need for these funds will be distributed over three years and will amount to €2 million each year.
It is expected that the funds for labelling programmes will be made available through the specific programme to promote the environment of municipalities, the revenue of which will increase significantly this year as a result of increased taxes on natural resources and the re-allocation of resources.
These funds will be used by municipalities not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castrations and other programmes.
According to Ms Mažeika, mandatory labelling practices are widespread in almost all the countries of the European Union, allowing the protection of the animals themselves (because they can easily be returned to owners) and saving the time of the breeders themselves when searches for a fleeing and aggravated pet have a lot of time and money.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel can only be carried with labelled pets.
At the same time, the labelling obliges the animal to care for all his life.
Earlier proposals were against mandatory labelling, as the programmes concerned were proposed to finance the population.
'The model now provided should avoid these criticisms, because animal protection is proposed to finance increased incomes in the environmental support programme and the right to label not only veterinarians but also publicists, i.e. individuals from animal care institutions who have listened to specific courses at the Veterinary Academy', says the authors of the project.
The draft law was registered by a group of Seimas members representing different Seimas groups - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

"Female lying better" star actor B. Arsobyte is persecuting liars
Probably it's just a coincidence, but the fascinating brown actor Brigita Arsobaitė has already received the roles associated with liars for a few times.
Initially, the series "Female lies better", then the performance "Melages" and finally the coma "Melagai".
In this movie, Brigita plays a squared wife of Song Kazlausk's heroes.
"I loved filming in "Melagiai", because I am more actor of the theatre and I appear rarely in the movie.
A wonderful team of colleagues has been gathered from the outset promised an excellent result.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the ground was the dog Sunny!
I thought that if I had a dog, it would be big and serious.
I never admire those little, decorative "fif" quadricycles.
However, during the filming Sunny so binded to me that sympathy became mutual and finally I wanted to buy it from the host, but unsuccessful," the actor smiles.
The comic and intriguing peripets of family members have been swept into the new Lithuanian comedia "Melagai", produced by Lithuanian film hits "Unexpected" and "Without our boys..." producer Paul Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas.
Your beloved has just reported, she's waiting.
It would be a great news, just... your beloved is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
Unable to publish all the "good news", parents suddenly declare - they differ!
After 50 years together...
And all this is happening just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - St. Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprised, because no one was expecting such a nuclear ass.
All the heroes are not as they seemed at first sight...
In the Arsobaitė commemoration "Melagai" the best mood for the viewers is four times the film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Dziedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Dzidvainis.
Comedia "Melagai" - in China from 9 November.
Decide whether to write 100 million euros for emigrants' unpaid taxes
On Tuesday, the Seimas accepted to consider the amendment of the law on declaration of the place of residence prepared by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the state.
56 Members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will then proceed to the reading of the amendments on or after 6 December, following the conclusion of the Government.
According to R. Karbauskis, these contributions are calculated for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliamentarians, over three years, one person does not pay around EUR 1 000, and now there are around 100 000 people.
Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that, in this way, the Seimas would encourage some people to fail to comply with their obligations - to declare the departure and then no taxes would be calculated.
Conservative Antanas Matulas, a member of the Committee on Health, noted that Lithuanians living abroad are using the fact that when they pay a small health insurance fee, they are coming to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as those paying this fee to the population.
The amendments provide that those who have left Lithuania are those who will pay social security contributions to the European Union, to the States of the European Economic Area or to the Swiss Confederation, while Sodra will exempt them from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The Head of Sodra Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that this step will facilitate both the life of those who have emigrated and the activities of Sodra.
An Internet-wide video about the slips reveals a serious problem
The mother’s lady has been filtered with a steep snowy slope, and the little one is still lying down and lying down again.
The video received many reviews and comments.
People were admired by the perseverance of the small bear - he wandered down several times again to his mother.
He does not succeed at the first time, but the young man is not trying to give up and finally reaches his goal.
The image was really focused, but it also reveals human hazards to animals.
Scientists claim that it is also necessary to talk about the fact that people’s desire to know wildlife may sometimes be harmful.
"I'm obvious that the local drone was very scared.
Their movements show that they are panicing.
If they did not fly around the drone, they would probably have chosen a safer road or have managed it slower or more cautiously.
This is an excellent example of how dorons should not be used," Ecologist Mark Ditmer said to the publication The Verge.
Some time ago, Mr Ditmer and his colleagues studied how the drones were working on the arrows.
Animals were fitted with heart work meters.
When the drone approached one of the bears ran away, others did not flee anywhere, but the hearts of all of them began to flee more often.
Scientists recommend that doors be used to film animals responsiblely, not too close, not to raise noise and not to fly where it is prohibited.
The fleeing president came through the newspaper
On Tuesday, the Kiev court invited the President who had left Russia, who had turned out, Viktor Janukovytai, to attend the hearing of the case on the issue of his suspect state in an unusual manner - the convocation was announced in the Official Journal of the State.
The convenience of the court, published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovoj Kurjer", invites the former leader to attend the criminal proceedings meeting on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document states that Mr Janukovičius has the right to take part in the video session.
On 30 October, Kiev's court announced that the debate in the case of V. Janukovičius has been completed.
Alexander Gorošinski, a lawyer of V. Janukovyčius in Russia, was given the opportunity to register in the register of foreign lawyers until November 19, so that he could participate in a meeting where V. Janukovyčius, as expected, will speak his last word in video.
Mr Janukovyčius, supported by the Kremlin, was turned down and ran to Russia during the Maidan rebellion in February 2014, provoked by the President's refusal to sign the association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been removed to Russia through a special operation organised by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia has annulled the Russian Peninsula, which belongs to Ukraine, and as far as the eastern war between separatists supported by Kiev and Russia has arisen later.
Since then, about 10,000 people have been killed by the fighting, despite many attempts by the international community to secure long - term ceasefire.

Restrictions on cogeneration power stations appealed against to the Constitutional Court
The opposition of the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) to the ruling of the governors to adopt a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition group of the Seimas Fatherland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) reported that the group of members of the Seimas appealed to the KT, asking the Governors to investigate the conformity of amendments to the Waste Management Law with the Constitution.
"Parliamentaryists stress that the provisions of the law aim to call on existing projects of waste incineration plants by entrusting the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the territory of residence) until the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste incineration plants started in Vilnius and Kaunas", states the report.
"Parliamentary authorities note that, given the nature of the ban on the construction of objects of public importance for waste management (i.e. the distance and the definition of the concept of "residence", this prohibition is disproportionately limited or even denied the nature of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for the production of energy, since the criteria laid down are formulated in such a way as to make the construction of such objects impossible in the whole territory of the country after assessing the density and distribution of the Lithuanian population in the country," they add.
The request states that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
"The CT has repeatedly indicated that the legislation does not apply to the legal facts and consequences of the entry into force of the new act.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law backwards in accordance with an undefined criterion.
When such regulation is established, it infringes the principles of constitutional legal certainty, legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law", the referral refers to.
It also notes that projects of cogeneration plants in Vilnius and Kaunas have already made significant financial investments.
If I stop the ongoing projects, the state would suffer not only hundreds of financial losses, the population of Lithuania would suffer huge losses, and the increase in heating prices, and the increasing amount of waste in landfill would increase environmental pollution.
Members of the Seimas TS-LKD, Liberals' Union, Social Democratic Groups, and Algirdas Butkevičius, Deputy Senior of the Governing Social Democrats Working Group, signed a call to the KT.
A few weeks ago, the Seimas was able to gather 71 votes to reject the amendments to the Waste Management Law adopted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė vet, which provide for the Government's right to stop the construction of cogeneration plants already started, as well as established a zone of 20 km from residential areas for the construction of such plants.
The amendments to the law adopted by the Seimas will enter into force from 1 January 2019. The Court, the rulers are already proposing to waive the 20 km limit.
This proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, the government's right to stop the projects already launched is not planned.
The CT will deal with this case in order - not earlier than one year later.

The beginning of LeBron James' career in Los Angeles' Lakers' Club is not what he himself, organization and basketball fans believed.
The Lakers season started with four victories and six loses, and such a weak start helped the shepherds to emerge as a result of the possible forgiveness of the coach Luke Walton.
However, such speeches were welcomed by the President of basketball operations, Magic Johnson, who said that the coach would not be fired, but that it was better to play.
The largest command star, Mr James, should turn to himself.
Although the attacker statistics are usually impressive - 26.8 point, 7.6 retro-reflected ball and 7.7 resultive transmission.
But she does not tell all the truth.

At the western conference, Lakers is only in 13 places, but several victories can turn everything around the top.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of the Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania very much appreciates Spanish cooperation with NATO and its significant contribution to the security of our country and region," Minister Linkevičius said.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out NATO Air Police and Air Police Strengthening missions in the Baltic States five times, of which three in Lithuania.

V. Ačienė about R. Ačo's detention: I believe in man's innocence and law enforcement
"I was the most unbelievable thing I could never think about.
On the other hand, the services are probably carrying out the work they have to do.
Everyone is doing our job.
I believe in law enforcement, I believe in my husband that everything is fair and fair, that no unfair action should be taken," Mr Ačienė said the BNS.
R. Ača, the Special Investigation Service (STT) held on Monday - the law enforcement officer suspects that he, even as the director of the Raseiniai Municipal Administration, took a large-value bowl, and in exchange was able to create exceptional conditions for a private company which signed a contract with the Raseiniai bus park managed by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected to have bought R. Ača directly or participated in the masking of buckets through various financial operations.
Raseiniai district municipal council R. Ačs was dismissed from the office of the head of administration on the third test this April.
The former "tvarkman" this year's struggle became a member of the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by the newly established Gediminas Kirkilas, and he suspended membership of this party on Monday.
Mr Ačas was unsuccessful in the Mayor elections as a representative of your Raseiniai election committee.
V. Ačienė says that the man did not intend to raise his nominations in the next year's elections of the Mayor of Raseiniai, but had not yet decided whether or not he would participate in the elections of municipal councils.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas with the list of Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union and is a member of the Seimas Anti-corruption Commission.
The politicians say that they are waiting for further law enforcement action, which will depend on whether it will be removed from the labour commission.
"I really do not make firm decisions today, this week, I think I will decide.
I will see if there is a need for any accusations that I will, of course, take a different or different decision.
It is probably necessary that I remain in the wake of all the things that are being investigated in the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again - the time to put everything into my places," she said.
Representation of Opposition Conservatives in Seimas Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulenienė invited the President of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the head of the "nationals" Ramūnas Karbauskis to separate from the statements made by the group colleague Vida Ačiene and to withdraw it from the Seimas Anti-corruption Commission by transferring to another Seimas Committee or Commission.
She claims that the further work of V. Ačien at the Seimas Anti-corruption Commission would "provide a public-based distrust and discredit the work of an important parliamentary supervisory commission".

The President urges China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a more favourable investment environment for investment in European Union (EU) countries and to facilitate foreign import conditions.
At the exhibition of Chinese imports in Shanghai, by opening the trade and investment forum, Mrs Grybauskaitė stressed that the overall objective of Europe and China should be to "combinate efforts to halt the spread of protectionism in the world" by applying the main causes of tension caused by trade wars, "producing surpluses and unfair competition".
'The European Union is a very important commitment of China to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment, which is important when negotiating a trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign businesses feel welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," said Mrs Grybauskaitė.
According to it, the opening up of China is important not only for Europe but also for this country, as well as for global economic growth.
The President stressed that the transparency of investments should be "preferably than the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, rule of law, strict observance of international treaties - this must be an essential issue for the environment of new investment relations", Mrs Grybauskaitė stressed.
'The corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries,' she added.
China's import exhibition is trying to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening its market and professes only its own companies.
The exhibition includes several heads of state, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistical Department, China currently holds 25th place among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50%, amounting to EUR 180 million.
At the same time, the volume of imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania can have unwanted political influence, and Beijing's special attention to Eastern Europe divides the EU's unity.

Disaster caused by Lion Air: False False False
Data on the black box of the collapse of the Indonesian Lion Air carrier show that in at least four last flights there has been a malfunction in the performance of the speed gauge, reported by researchers on Monday.
The President of the National Committee on Transport Security (UNSC) Soerjanto Tjahjonas said that a similar incident occurred during the last four flights of the aeroplane, including the determinant, when on 29 October the boat fell into the Java Sea immediately after the rise from Jakarta.
All 189 people on the plane died during this disaster.
Many media reported intrusions during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the capital of Indonesia.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact the technical problem was the speed of the air, in other words the speed of the plane," Mr Tjahjon said during the press conference.
"The data on the black box showed that during two flights before the flight Denpassar-Jokarta was the same problem," he added.
"Social networks are smoothed by a lot of rumors.
Now we want to explain that in the black box (continued data) about the four flights during which there were problems with the speed of the air meter," indicated the head of the NTSK.
During the meeting with the members of the dead families, Mr Tjahjonas said that the flight data recorder information corresponds to reports that the flight speed and height of the last flight have changed irregularly.
Search teams have not yet found second black boxes to record interviews in the pilot cab.
Lion Air indicated that it had been corrected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations during the flight from Bali to Jakarta.
Rusdi Kirana, one of the founders of the company, was not invited to speak to the Minister of Transport, Buddi Karya Sumadi, a meeting of the members of the families of the modelling teams, with officials to supervise the search for aeroplanes and victims' residue and disaster investigations.
However, he stood up and set his head down when the wrathful and distressing family members demanded that Mr Kirana, together with his brother Kusnan, set up Lion Air in 1999.
"Lion Air was wrong," said one man who presented himself as a father of the passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as prosecutor on the island to which the plane flies.
"I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to draw attention," he stressed.
- Lion Air never contacted me since the start of the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air did not show us any compassion."
After this meeting, Mr Kirana has promptly left, avoiding journalists' questions.
Many families look forward to the results of the long-lasting identification process.
Police medical experts have been transferred to nearly 140 lavon bags loaded with parts of people's remains.
Until now, only 14 victims have been identified.
The Birds questioned why a sailplane was allowed to fly two months ago, even though the flight from Bali to Jakarta took place in October 28, which resulted in a malfunction, including the fear of passengers of a sudden downturn of the aeroplane immediately after the take-off.
Lion Air said that this failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem was solved?
- If not, the machinery concerned must be held liable.
The law is very clear, not they said that the plane was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians have to answer under the law, so that aircraft disasters in Indonesia are no longer repeated.
Mr Tjahjonas said that a large number of small cuts and the fact that the cuts spread in a relatively small area suggests that the boater is likely to blow into the water at very high speeds.
"The plane was homogeneous when it fell into the sea.
He did not explode in the air, and the aeroplane engines, when he touched the water, acted with large screws - this is an indication of all the turbine turbine nuts," the official explained.
Lion Air's collapse is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died from the collapse of Garuda's aircraft near Medan.
After the crash, the rescuers were led: the victim and the minor
On Monday evening on the road Weddings - Plunge, at Tilvikai hit cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
Cars have been hit by a cactamus, and three people are reported to be victims.
It is reported that the BMW driver, born in 1999, traveled to the opposite side of traffic, and the cactamush flies to the car "Mercedes-Benz", in which Dad was born in 1967, and the daughter, born in 2005.
The BMW driver was saved by fires - rescuers.
The girl from Mercedes-Benz's got her teeth out of the crash.
All the victims are going to hospital.
Presidency: no artificial facilitation for the referendum
Following the adoption by the Seimas of a proposal by the governors to reduce the referendum cartels to which the first section of the Constitution currently has greater protection, the President will veto amendments, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
'The Constitution was voted by more than half of the population, which is a requirement.
This is also the case, especially for the articles contained in its first section, which should certainly be at least a smaller majority.
It is hard to predict that the President would really veto," an advisor to the internal policy of Dalia Grybauskaitė said to the Knowledge Radio on Tuesday.
He emphasised that, in the first section of the Constitution, the basic elements of the state are defined: language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, and that, therefore, the reduction in the number of votes required to replace these articles, according to Mrs Linges, would lead to the creation of a 'negative precedent' and 'reverting the unmanageable risk'.
"The auditor believes that there is no artificial relief, more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more dialogue with people," he believed.
The Seimas plans to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of the amendment to the Referendum Law.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Sections 1 and 4 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of the citizens entitled to vote so agree during the referendum.
At present, more than half of all citizens entitled to vote may replace the articles of Sections 1 and 4 of the Constitution by referendum.
The right to vote in Lithuania has about 2.5 million citizens: half would be 1.25 million voters, two fifths - million voters.
This proposal was born after the adoption by the Seimas of the President's veto in September on amendments previously adopted in Parliament which mitigated the requirements for the number of votes for the amendment of Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution defining citizenship.
The card is proposed to the referendum in preparation for a referendum on double citizenship, and it should take place on the 12th of May and 26th of May of the following year when the first and second rounds of presidential elections are planned.
The migrants cannot currently have double citizenship on the 11th of March 1990, with the exception of some exceptions.
Double citizenship is sought by the Lithuanian community of the world, but it is afraid that, under the current circumstances, the referendum would not happen - there would be a sufficient number of people not to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports "grey" so they need to be updated
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure begins to friction, and therefore it needs to be updated, says the Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, renovation of Vilnius Airport is a minimum task that the State must perform.
"Air transport infrastructure has already been struck because it has been planned for smaller passenger flows.
We must update Vilnius Airport - this is not even part of the distant planning, that is the minimum we have to do," Mr Masiulis said on Tuesday at the Transport Conference held by the Democracy Development Fund and the State magazine.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of Klaipėda's external port, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, or perhaps the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important: we need to complete road, rail integration, construction of the external airport in Klaipėda, airport handling, and perhaps to decide on the construction of the new airport.
We must not sleep, we already start projects that will exploit our potential after 10, 20 or 30 years," the Minister of Transport said.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that there has been insufficient funds for car maintenance in recent years.
"The situation of roads is not improving at present because the funds are not allocated enough.
We are able to build new roads, but even for critical care, for example on roads, there is a lack of funds.
We must set the amount to be allocated to road maintenance if we want to improve their condition," Mr Masiulis said.
He emphasised that Lithuania's transport sector's exports increased by 18.6% this year, while the largest export market became Germany, around Russia.
Mr Masiulis once again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers will be obliged to return to the country of registration periodically.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel like at home.
In my opinion, the proposal for a trainer's permanent return to home is absurd, because, in Europe, empty trucks would burn fuels and increase emissions.
Rail will be most successful, as the costs will increase so that part of transport will pass to the railways.
We are looking for ways to protect our positions," Mr Masiulis said.
According to the Ministry of Communications, 12.2% are created in the transport sector.
Lithuania's gross domestic product (GDP).
It employs more than 118.000 employees and has more than 7.500 companies.
Disputes with heritage guards
Last week, Masiulis announced in the Committee on Economics of the Seimas that it had started negotiations on a change in the cultural purpose of the Vilnius airport building, which would allow the old terminal to be destroyed and built a new one.
However, the Interim Head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (CPD) Algimantas Degutis referred to the deliberations of Mr Masiulis as political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the 1990s is a value recorded in the register in 1993 and not politicians, but specialists have to decide on its removal.
Mr Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving the image of Lithuania.
"The removal of this old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step to destroy it and build a new modern arrival terminal to feel in a modern country and not in such an interesting, truly unrepresentative country," Mr Masiulis said last week in the Seimas.
Mr Masiulis then also announced that it was planned to build a completely new passenger terminal in Kaunas and connect the airport to the Rail Baltica road by building a ground station.
This transport unit should operate in 2026 after the construction of Rail Baltica.
Last year, Vilnius Airport served about 3.7 million people, this year expected 4.8 million passengers, and next year 5 million passengers.
Kaunas Airport served 1,2 million passengers last year.

Next year, direct flights to Madagascar will start from Vilnius
In the spring of the following year, the largest scheduled passenger aeroplane Boeing 767, which will fly travellers from Lithuania directly to the island of Bee, which belongs to Madagascar, will land at Vilnius Airport on the basis of the information of the tour operator, "Itaka Lietuva", writes the portal "madeinvilnius.lt".
It is announced that the passengers of Blue Panorama will be able to choose from 259 economic and 8 business classes.
The new direction of holiday will be reached directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominikas Milowskis, Director-General of "Itaka Lietuva", claims that tourists from Lithuania are trying to offer more and more new holiday courses.
Madagascar is a island in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Other travel organisers have also developed new holiday travel routes for the summer season 2019.
For example, "Novaturas" and "Itaka" will start flying directly from Vilnius to Tiran, Albania.
Minister of Finance on a potential crisis: It is important not to talk about the disease
"We must always prepare for more difficult times.
I would like to welcome the fact that, for the third year in a row, we have reserves for the first time in Lithuania's history.
But it is also very important that we do not talk about the disease," Mrs Šapoka said on Monday in Brussels.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Minister for Finance and Deputy Minister Miglė Tuskienė attend the meetings of the Eurogroup and the EU Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN).
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues relating to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoiding fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on the taxation of revenues from the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States until agreement is reached at global level.
The Euro Group will review the draft budgets of the euro area countries presented to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the Italian draft budget as non-compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC makes use of this option.
Further information was requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the deepening of Economic and Monetary Union: the feasibility of implementing the European Deposit Insurance System and the reform of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the functions of the ESM must be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of the functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.
Balys Burachis.
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
The last 120 years have elapsed since the birth of a famous Lithuanian photographer and artist of culture, ethnography and landscaper Balis Buračas (1897-1972) in Sidarai, Šiaulenai, then in Šiauliai Guberny.
Reminding the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian State, we have a great opportunity to remember how the living national rebirth has called many Lithuanian people, including brothers Buračus - Bali, Jonas, Brony - from the depth of the village itself, we can take part in the promotion, understanding and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balis Buračas traveling after his home country with a camera in his hands over 50 years has provided a wide and realistic picture of our country’s customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He tried to preserve the rapidly endangered national cultures and had a rare ability to understand the remaining value of his work.
In Bali Burach photography, Lithuanian landscape, castle hills, everyday and holiday environments, our people decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines in national costumes.
This publication contains a significant part of Bali Burach’s legacy for the description of national labour customs and associated traditions and, above all, their attractive iconography.
The advertised material shows not only the specificity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the last century, despite two world wars and heavy occupations.
The book’s manuscript contains a lot of descriptions of the works of the interwar Žemaitia, especially the cuppices, the north, the tentians, and the people of Highitatia and Dzucia, their celebrations and other traditions and customs written by Bali Burach.
Some 10000 negative photos stored in museums and archives have been selected for this publication, more than 400 rare photos, mostly not published so far, grouped according to selected texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, typical of cuprics, dwellers, other regions of High and Žemaitia.

Tragic couple’s fate: just a few hours after marriage
In the southwest of the US state of Texas, a couple of young married men died in the helicopter disaster just a few hours ago.
The 24-year-old William Troy Bey Beyler and his wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after the midnight helicopter rose into the sword 16 km northwest of Yuwald and 129 km west of San Antonio, said the local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the disaster took place in about 24 miles [24 km], just as many youths had been years old.
Helicopter pilot 76 years old Gerald Douglas Lawrence also died.
The young men studied at the State University of Sam Houston, located in Huntville, Texas State.
They were married on Saturday evening in the Bailers’ family rance near Juwaldi, and after the marriage celebration, they fled a family-owned helicopter.
The accident occurred when the helicopter flew about 24 miles [24 km] away.
The young people fled to the International Airport of San Antonio, where they were going to sit on the plane and fly in the honey month, said Mr Kennedy, without specifying the purpose of the final couple's journey.
"It's a very clever, unequal landmark area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," said Mr. Kennedy.
Mr Lawrence has been piloting aircraft in that family for many years.
According to Mr Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After the autopsy, the physical condition of the pilot should be explained and whether it could not be the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter broke about 5-10 minutes after the lift.
His breaks were seen in a wide radius on the rocky hillside, and the body remained "hazardously stolen", on Monday during the press conference, said air safety investigator Craigas Hatchas from the National Transport Security Board (HIM).
Researchers are going to take the cuts and then thoroughly see them, but the tractor and the truck will not be easy to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been identified and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published after two weeks.
The Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran 'historical day'
"Today is a historical day," Mr Netanyahu said to the members of his party's "Likud" parliament, reported his office.
"Today is the day when, under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump (Donald Tramp), the United States introduces extremely severe sanctions against Iran, the most severe sanctions against Iran throughout the time when efforts to curb his aggression began," said the Head of the Government of Israel.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman (Avigdor Lyberman) stated that the new sanctions would bring a "critical" impact on Israel's action in the region.
The measures which Washington calls the 'strongest sanctions for all the time' have begun to apply after the decision taken in May and controversially to withdraw from the world's power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear programme.
Sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen about a million barrels per day since May, and to separate Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says that its scope and time limits are too limited.
The Jewish State also says that the abolition of sanctions has enabled Iran to finance the fighting groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighbouring Syria and has promised not to allow it to enter into force there from a military point of view.
The other parties to the agreement with Iran - Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - disagree with the US decision and say that the agreement, as has been envisaged, has prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons so far.
The Court releases the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
In the death of a young motorbike in Vilnius, the Nordic town, the court will listen to witnesses in the accident case.
The Vilnius Regional Court decided on Tuesday that, in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one witness will be interviewed at the next meeting on 26 November.
The judgment in this case has already been issued, but does not agree with it by the prosecutor's office.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court, due to the death of the motorcyclist, judged the driver of the car, who declared Eduard Osipov 79 years old that the motorcyclist was driving at high speed and committed a serious violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Prosecutor's Office asks the regional court to abolish the judgment of the district court and claims that the biggest fault due to the accident lies with E. Osipov and that the conclusions of the district court are unfounded.
The lawyer of the dead motorcycler’s family is also asked for the annulment of the judgment.
The accident took place on the 11th of August 2015, about 15:00, when the car "Škoda Fabia" driven by E. Osipovo entered the street of Žirmūnai and met with the main motorcycle driving on the road.
The prosecutor's husband was accused that the driver of the car violated the road traffic rules that were intended to give up the road and caused a road accident - a man who died on the main road of Piaggo.
The primary police reports indicate that the driver of the motoroler died, but later after the investigations, it was found that the vehicle was assimilated to the motorcycle by its power.
Judge Roland Bužinsk BNS of Vilnius City District Court has said that experts have found that the motorcycle driver was driven at a speed of 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the permissible speed is 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver of the car could not predict that the motorcycle would be driven at such high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the car driver of a glorious age claimed that he was just 5-6 miles [5-6 km] per hour.
The driver, who saw the barrier, tried to stop and dropped from the vehicle before faced with "Škoda Fabia".
The prosecutor believes that from the sideway to the main road, Mr Osipov had to give the way to the motorcycler.
"Novaja Gazeta": six Vagner's staff in Syria died
Among the dead - five Syrian military troops and six persons belonging to the Vagner military company.
The source of New Gazette in Syria is announced.
According to the source, one of the parts of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps was deployed in that territory, to which a large number of Syrian volunteers and "military recruits" have joined.
New Gazeta sent an enquiry to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia with a request for information about Russian fate.
Former Belgian King will have to perform a paternity test
This decision is a partial victory for artist Delphine Boel.
Since 2013, it seeks to be recognised as a child of the former monarch.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a short love romance decades ago.
The 84-year-old king denies his fatherhood.
According to the RTBF Station, he may apply to the Supreme Court in opposition to DNA investigation.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques, the former man of the Dephine mother, is neither in biological nor legal terms a father of the artist.
Delphine appealed for recognition of the daughter of "real" father Albert.
The CSR will allocate money to the parties, but the social workers will not give anything
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) intends to allocate to the largest political parties a budget grant of almost 3 million euro this week.
This spring, the Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), under the leadership of Vice-President Gediminas Kirkilas, has been set up, until now no budget allocation is foreseen.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the GOC in the event of a change in the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to parties.
Laura Matošaityte, President of the CVC, informed the CV, that "the Commission's meeting is scheduled this Thursday, which intends to take a decision on the allocation of a half-yearly budget grant to parties".
According to the Commission, the decision on this issue must be taken by the GOC by 15 November.
Provision is made for seven parties, six of which are Parliamentary, to be allocated to EUR 2.751 million.
The opposition Parental Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million euro, the Governing State-Green Union - approximately 0.55 million euro, the Opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million euro, the Opposition Liberal Union - almost 0.4 million euro, the Seimas without its group - about 0.23 million euro, the recently acceding Government-Societal and Justice Party - almost 0.22 million euro, represented in Parliament, but not the Polish Electoral Sharement-Christian Family Union - about 0.18 million euro.
In accordance with the law currently in force, which will also lead the GOC to allocating budget money, grants shall be allocated to parties which meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in recent elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow only the LSDDP established this spring to expect money from the budget.
For this party has not yet participated in any of the elections.
It is true that the governing coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers receive at least a couple of hundreds of thousands of euros in the coming three elections - self-government, the President and the European Parliament.
The amendments adopted by the Seimas to the laws of political parties and this year's budget were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the Governors, Mr Kirkilas and leader Ramūnas Karbauskis, believe that the parliamentarians will seek to reject the opposition of the President.
However, it will not be possible to do so before this Thursday, so, according to Mr Matošaityte, "the grants will be divided according to the legal order that existed until now".
True, the head of the GOC did not reject that if the Seimas rejected the President's veto and the new amendment to the budget allocation to the parties entered into force this or the next week, the Commission could consider a decision on the allocation of an additional grant to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
"When we take the decision into account the entire existing legal environment, because we are an executive authority with the implementation of the laws," she said.
If the Seimas would be able to reject the veto and the new laws would enter into force, they would distribute additional money to the parties by the Government after additional borrowing.
The grant already allocated to seven parties would not be affected by such a decision.

Porošenka: activist Handziuk killing sponsors must be punished
"I would like to state that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each will be checked very carefully in accordance with the investigation procedures.
I, as President, do not have the opportunity and do not have to obtain information that could harm the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only this will make it possible to learn the truth and punish evil," Mr Porošenka said at the meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in clarifying the murder of Mrs Handziuk and the murderers, the organisers of the crime and the sponsors of the crime "take the necessary responsibility".
"When this case has been requalified to murder, they are quite rightly and reasonably threatened with imprisonment until a live head sentence," the President of Ukraine said.
He rightly referred to the public's request for an open and impartial examination of this case.
Mr Porošenka stressed that the speeches by the representatives of law enforcement authorities in Parliament should show that 'the government is determined to take off criminals and murderers into account what they would be.'
He also said that political speculation on this subject will not help to clarify the situation, but will confuse things even more.
"I urge all the forces that support power and opposition, not to ignore unjustified arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations," the President said.
- On the contrary, we now have to unite and ensure that the survey is effective, fair and transparent and fast - so as to raise public confidence.
We just don't have another way."
'Nobody will be allowed to take advantage of this situation in the country for destabilisation,' he assured.
In July, K. Handziuk was attacked and circulated with acid in the city of Cherson before corruption.
She was advisor to the Mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized but died at the hospital on Sunday.
Unexplained to the police and prosecutors of this attack, on Tuesday, the prosecutor General of Ukraine, Juris Lucenka, issued a declaration of resignation.
After her death, the public activists were accused that they could not properly carry out the investigation.
The activists also required the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Home Affairs.
'I am presenting my declaration of resignation today,' said Mr Lucenka to the Members of Parliament, reading his study report.
Parliament must also accept the resignation of the prosecutor.
Mr Lucenka accused activists of putting pressure on the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify K. Handziuk's murderers.
Billas Gatesas presented a toilet without water
By presenting a futurist toilet, Bill Gatesas compared the transition from traditional equipment to waterless equipment to the Revolution of the computers of the 1970s.
The founder of Microsoft Billas Gatesas presented a high-tech toilet in Beijing, which does not need water pipes, reported Reuters.
The toilet without water works in accordance with the principle of solid and liquid waste separation.
Both types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technology you see here is the greatest achievements in sanitation over the past 200 years", said Bloomberg, Bill Gates.
The technological toilet was created by the charity fund established by Billas Gatesas and his wife, Melinda.
Within seven years, the fund spent $200 million on a facility that could convert human waste into fertiliser or water.
A total of 20 toilet models were created, according to Billo Gates.
Now the device is finished and can be sold.
However, in order to make such toilets massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend 200 million more.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500 thousand children under five years of age die each year because of poor sanitary conditions in the world.
The fight against problems caused by poor sanitation, such as cholera and others, increases the amount of money spent on health protection, which is already worth 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Billas Gatesas is in the toilet presentation of glass with feces.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in a small example "can be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria causing infectious diseases, 100 thousand worm parasite eggs".

Anxiety in France: human deaths are worrying
On Monday, the French health officers announced a permanent ban on widespread use of pesticides in the face of concern for several decades of recent poisoning in the western of the country.
The Health Agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all pesticide-metam products was taken following a new safety check launched earlier this year, at least three intoxication waves in the Department of Art and Luara, which started in September.
As a result of these cases, the government has already suspended the use of the pesticide.
This soil disinfection chemical should not contact plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large quantities.
In France, about 700 tonnes were used each year.
At least 70 people, including a large number of farm workers, in the region of Anja, where there are many salad juices, have complained about eye and throat rhinitis, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision but did not accelerate it," said the Deputy Director of ANSES Francoise Weber (Fransuaza Veber) on Monday.
The US Environment Agency (US EPA) considers the metame, one of the most commonly used pesticides in the US and Europe, as a 'possibly human carcinogen'.
This pesticide sold under names such as Vapam and Stagon is authorised in Europe for up to 2022 when a new security check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice, but to remove it from the market, regardless of whether there are alternatives," Mr Weber said to the newspaper.
"We are surrounded by the difficulties faced by producers of salad juice, farmers in general, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed their dissatisfaction with the government's decision to suspend the use of metam in a region which is highly dependent on intensive agriculture.
In this region, more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of salad juice consumed annually in Europe are grown near Nanto.
The next season will be "more fewer salad juices, ridicules and pairs", in the last month, after the government stopped the use of metam, the AFP said to the news agency of Nanto producer federation leader Philippe retiere (Filip Retjeras).
70 million euro invested in Tallinn in the shopping centre with a review circle
A new shopping centre "T1" is opened in the capital of Estonia on the coming weekend, to which the local capital real estate (NT) development company "Pro Capital Groupp" invested 70 million euros.
130.000 sq. m total or 55.000 sq. m rented area in the shopping centre will be 150 shop services or entertainment places, more than 30 cafes and restaurants, as stated by the developer's report.

T1 - the first shopping centre with the viewing circle installed on the roof, says the developer.
It will start working at the beginning of the next year.
In addition, international transport gateways will also be integrated into the territory: alongside trams and shortly cross-urban buses.
The main Rail Baltica terminal is also running nearby, and it is projected to serve 1 million passengers per year in about 2026.
Paola Michelozzi, the Director-General of Pro Capital Groupp, says that the global business of the shopping centres is undergoing major changes and T1 has succeeded in developing them.
"We have created a new generation of shopping center, which gives emotions and experiences that are not available on the Internet.
It is a place of attraction of people in the city center itself, travelers' gates, an impressive and worthy object to visit and at the same time high quality spent time with friends or family," Mr Michelozzi is quoted in the press report.
Great attention to entertainment
According to the shopping centre manager, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
A total of 12.000 sq.m, or a fifth of the total rented area.
Exclusive accent - a circle of reviews installed on the roof.
It will raise guests to 120 m above sea level - Tallinn's higher TV tower only.
After the review circle, on the fourth floor, a bat park "Super Skypark", which will open the largest European bat centre and the first Estonian basketball and netting square on the bat, says the company.
In the interactive centre of studies and discoveries, SkyLAB promises children to take at least 5-6 hours.
In the entertainment complex there will be 360 degree panoramic 4D kin.
In addition to the usual cinema displayed in six halls, visitors will also be able to feel in the cinema of virtual reality with interactive 7D cinema.
Beyond visual effects and moving under the movie rhythm of chairs, the feeling of reality here will be strengthened by the sensation of wind, rain or snow effects, as well as the chosen smells, smoke or smoke in the film hall.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonian revenue from tourism by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300.000 visitors.
Pro Capital Groupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic stock exchange, as well as on the Frankfurt stock exchange.
Last year, the group received 1.8 million EUR sales income and suffered 350.000 EUR losses in Lithuania, according to the Pro Capital Groupp financial report.
In 2016, sales revenues of almost 9 million euro were made on the Lithuanian market and net profits of 2.4 million euro were earned.
The shopping centre T1 was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
President Paul Biya sworn in Cameroon after the controversial elections for the seventh term
During the 85-year ceremony under the supervision of Parliament's President Cavaye Yeguie Djibrill, Mr Biya promised to protect the 'unity and unity of the Western African State'.
The oldest President of Africa, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was announced as winner in the elections held on 7 October with 71% of the votes cast.
However, the elections were obscured by the low number of voters, violence and suspicion of fraud.
At the eve of the Biya inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including directors, were kidnapped in one presbiterian school in the North West region, where the English-speaking separatists are carrying out a armed campaign for independence.
The majority of the 22 million people in Cameroon are French and fifth are English.
In 2016, autonomy began to be required in the North West and the neighbouring Southwest province, in the event of a dissatisfaction due to alleged discrimination in the fields of education, judiciary and economy.
In 2017, when Mr Biya refused to give up radicals announced the independent state, the Republic of America, and raised weapons.
According to the data of non-governmental organisations, at least 400 civilian and more than 175 security force officials died this year during separatist attacks and government response operations.
More than 300 000 people have escaped from violence: some are crossing the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in half-badly forests.
During the elections in the North Western region in October, only 5% of the voters voted and 15% of the electorate in the Southwest Province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya collected two thirds of the votes.
Pre-election of conservers: errors due to inexperience
"When there was a lack of space, understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed their premises to be used, but there were no voting cabs everywhere, because we cannot buy them themselves.
Thank you to those who lent it," said the politics.
According to him, complaints were received, but their content is not substantially altered and the infringements themselves are not malignant.
"These were.
Not all the people who participated in the elections were experienced - they were also aware of the news.
Thus, not all of our actions were in line with that experience.
Therefore, the CRC had to warn against compliance with the principles described by us.
These complaints do not, however, give rise to doubts about the results," Mr Anušauskas said.
According to the President of the CRC, there have been cases where the ballot papers were not stamped - when the ballot papers were found in the ballot boxes were cancelled without the stamp.
In some towns there has been a lack of space, but according to Mr Anušausko, complaints and violations concern several dozens of ballot papers.
'Well, since the difference is several thousand, this does not really mean a fundamental difference in the results of the elections,' explains Mr Anušauskas.
It is claimed that the number of members in elections was 55%, while the number of non-partial voters was 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in commissions.
The results published on Sunday are also unchanged - 79 % of the voters (16418 votes) voted in favour of the winning Ingrid, while 21 % was in favour of Vyguaud Ušack (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council will formally support the candidate I.Simonytė in the presidential elections to be held in May next year.
Short says you don't probably meet Putin in Paris
The White House's National Security Advisor John Bolton said earlier that Mr Trump will meet with Mr Putin in Paris, where the 100th anniversary of the 100th anniversary of the end of the World War will take place this week.
However, while leaving the last myths before the US Congress middle-election, Mr Trumpas said that he was not sure of whether this would be the right opportunity to meet the Russian President.
"I'm not sure we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not," noted the US President.
However, the head of the White House has added, they will see at the G-20 Summit and will be "the most likely many times" afterwards.
D. Trumpas is still trying to "reload" relations with Moscow, despite the suspicions that Russia will get involved in the 2016 US presidential elections.
Kęstutis Strupas asks for the annulment of the NEC Decision
Kęstutis Strupas, the former Director-General of the Clinics of Santara University of Vilnius, asks for the annulment of the decision of the Central Official Ethics Commission (VTEK) - it recognises that transactions which have not been declared in good time and thus violated the law.
K. Strupo’s complaint was examined by Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant requested the annulment of the decision of VTEK on 23 May, the BNS notified the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltadounė.
K. Strupas believes that the gifts given to loved ones should not be declared; he claims that he has so understood the exception to the law.
In May, VTEK announced that then the director-general of Santara’s clinics, K. Strupas, and the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of Vilnius University Hospital, Silvija Strupienė, violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
During the investigation it was found that four transactions were declared in breach of the deadlines: a loan from the bank with the spouse in 2010, a purchase of securities from the bank in 2017, a gift provided to the daughter in 2017 - a apartment and a loan granted and unrecovered to the spouse in 1996.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by terminology.
Persons who have violated the Law on the Harmonisation of Public and Private Interests in the Public Service may not be encouraged for the year.
The law obliges you to declare not only your own data but also the data of your spouse.
The study was carried out by VTEK on the basis of the information from the Info TV TV.
It was explained whether S. Strupienė and his spouse, head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Division of Vilnius University Hospital of the Republic of Vilnius, declared their transactions properly and in a timely manner.
As announced by Info TV, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter a real estate worth EUR 125 000.
However, the former head of the clinicals of Santara and his wife had not indicated their interest in their declarations.
Legislative protection, along with at least ten more people, has expressed suspicions in the corruption investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public computers, the purchase of software in clinics demanded illegal financial remuneration from companies, it was blocked as support.
In this way, K. Strupas was suspected to have spoken at least five times in Santara's clinics in the field of information technology procurement.
Mr Strup himself denies his fault.
In September, professor K. Strupas, suspected of corruption, was exempted from the duties of Santara Clinic Head.
The decision of the Ministry of Health of Santara and Vilnius University of clinical participants to terminate working relations with K. Strupai at his own request.

Schools already want to teach differently: promise less tests, more practice
Such changes in the content of education are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which was presented on Monday at the forum "The change in the content of education: foreign experience in Lithuania".
Ms Jurgita Petrauskienė, Minister of Education and Science, spoke in the debate, said that over 30 million euros have been invested in the renovation of the educational content over the last ten years, but no results can be seen.
"In line with the results of the international study of pupils' achievements, pupils' achievements are below the OECD average," said Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The report of the Ministry of Education and Science quoted by the OECD expert Phil Lambert said that Lithuania was too focused on providing knowledge, not on practical adaptation of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programmes focus on learning literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, but it is also necessary to develop child creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and empathy.
Vice-President of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius, presenting changes in the content of general education, said that the scope of the renovation programmes launched in this academic year will be reduced and more specific, and disciplines are more closely interlinked.
According to the Deputy Minister, pupils' education will be more individualised, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed to prepare between 10% and 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of assessment of pupils will change to the cumulative score, higher weights and non-formal competences of the pupil.
Lower standardised tests.
Acknowledging that the general education programmes will be digital, convenient to use, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
Upgrading the educational content aims at improving pupils' achievements in the international PISA study by at least 10%, reducing the gap between pupils' achievements by a third, obtaining modern competences in school and literacy in various areas.
Lithuania plans to allocate €8.8 million of funds from the European Union and the state budget to renew the content of the education in May 2018.
The project will be tested in part of schools in 2019-2020, and will be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry had criticised the project of almost EUR 8 million of the Fire Development Centre for the renewal of the framework programmes for primary, primary and secondary education.
For the four years, EUR 7.8 million was earmarked for this, and the first purchase of EUR 1.3 million was launched at the beginning of October to look for education programme developers.
After the experts criticised this purchase, he was suspended, Ms Petrauskienė, Minister of Education and Science, dismissed Giedrių Vaidelis, Director of the Centre for Development.
Lithuania - exercises on how to react to extreme flooding
In Lithuania, on Monday, ten-day exercises are started to improve the response of institutions to the extreme flood.
As the Fire Protection and Rescue Department (PAGD) has informed, the exercise will verify how public authorities are prepared to work in the country following the state-level emergency, such as the flooding: eliminating its consequences, coordinating the search for people, rescue and rapid displacement from the affected areas, organising their supply of drinking water, food, ensuring the necessary energy supply and other measures to protect the population.
More than 100 representatives from all ministries of the country, other institutions, as well as members of 12 municipal emergency operations centres will participate in the exercises.
On 5-13 November, the preparatory phase will take place, during which the municipalities will take decisions on emergency management, after receiving information from the Hydromeorology Service from the PAGD on the ongoing falls and on the beginning of the flood.
The active phase of exercise is planned on 14-15 November.
During it the department will operate the Centre for State Emergency Operations and the Centres for Institutional Emergency Operations in the State and Municipal Institutions.
Following the announcement by the Government of a state-level emergency due to the consequences of the flood, the Head of Operations appointed by the Prime Minister will direct the emergency response, the elimination of its consequences, and the protection and rescue of the population and property.
The Deputy Director of the PAGD Mindaugas Kanapickas says that it is most important in the exercise to verify the preparation of the institutions for carrying out the statutory functions, to assess the possibilities for exchanging information, to check how warning and information about the dangers of the disaster has been prepared, to state and municipal institutions, bodies and enterprises, and to "improve the skills of emergency management of state institutions".
The exercise will also demonstrate the overall capacity of the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian fire-savers to overhaul a huge amount of water from the areas covered.
The WhiteFloodCombat module was set up for this purpose in 2009.
Resigning to Ukraine's Prosecutor General Jurijus Lucenka
The Ukrainian Prosecutor General Jurijus Lucenka, speaking on Tuesday in the national parliament, announced resignations due to the resonance caused by the death of the fighter with acidity in the fighter against corruption Katerina Gandziuk, announces the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to the law of Ukraine, the prosecutor General must submit a request for resignation to the President of the country, and this is to submit to the Supreme Rada by a majority of votes for approval.
On Tuesday, prosecutor General Lucenko presented the course and results of the law enforcement investigation on K. Gandziuk's murder order in the Supreme Rada.
In his speech, he described the study as effective to the parliamentarians, but expressed the appallingness that Mr Gandziuk's death was exploited by politics for public relations.
K. Gandziuk was an activist of Ukraine, fighting against corruption, who publicly spoke about police corruption in its native southern Ukrainian city in Cherson.
On July 31, an unknown attacker at her home, K. Gandziuk, specked the acid into her face.
On 4 November, she died in a hospital because of her injuries.
The opponents to the Ministry of the Interior of Ukraine demand the answer who killed K. Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix nuotr.
According to Mr Lucenko, in law enforcement investigations, 12 persons are likely to be involved in ordering to kill Mr Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the study was convicted by the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, the suspects have received essential knowledge about the leakage of information.
Mr Lucenko added to his personal knowledge of Mr Gandziuk and was appalling that some politicians use her blood for public relations.
"When nobody has any reason to say that someone intervenes in the power, I want to state that I make a declaration of resignation.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today, and you will have to discuss this in Parliament," Mr Lucenko's speech in Rada quoted the Obozrevatel publication.
It is written that Mr Lucenko added that 'can't allow the country's double-government when the law enforcement system is disrupted without any evidence, even for the crimes discovered'.
Mr Lucenko is considered to be a close associate of the President of the country, Peter Porošenka.
He was appointed prosecutor-general on 12 May 2016, following the prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor from this post, Victor Šokin, suspected of corruption by senior officials and politicians.
Minister for Energy J. Vaičiūnas meets representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Energy Minister's adviser Aurelija Vernickaitė informed Elta, the meeting will address the achievement of renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that is currently not in line with the trajectory of national renewable energy action plans at EU level - the share of renewable energy in 2015 was 6%.
In the EC's assessment, progress towards a binding 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and uncertain regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly sourced from biofuels (88%) and electricity plays a lower role at this stage.
The Seimas took a proposal to complement corruption investigation issues with conservative referrals to the CT
The Seimas agreed on Tuesday after the submission of the proposal registered for an investigation of the illegal influence on political processes by "national" Agnė Širinskienė.
There were 58 members of the Seimas, nine parliamentarians abstained before - 27.
The draft will continue to be discussed by the Seimas Committees appointed by A. Širinskienė, headed by the Committee on Legal Affairs.
Following its conclusion, the amendment to the resolution will be put to the vote.
At present, the Interim Investigation Commission of the Seimas, which is conducting a new political corruption investigation, has been instructed to explain possible illegal effects in 2008-2016.
Mr Širinskienė proposed that this deadline be extended by stating that "in the public space there has been significant information about possible illegal effects and impacts on political processes and public authorities".
A. Širinskienė named the project "the possible representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by referring to the Constitutional Court or attempting to influence the decision-making processes of such important independent institutions as the Central Commission for Official Ethics".
Oppositive conservatives initiated a referral to the Constitutional Court on Pensions.
Governing 'nationals' have found that conservatives have based largely on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their referral.
The leaders of "nationals" are accused of the former associate Povil Urbsch, the Central Commission for Official Ethics (VTEK).
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seimas State Administration and Municipality Committee was able to assign to the members of the VTEK the former Head of the Commission's Prevention Division Mindaugas Siauris from office.
At the end of September, the Seimas constituted a commission explaining the alleged illegal influence of interested persons or groups thereof, the influence on the election process, the formation of coalitions, the appointment of parliamentary groups, the work of individual politicians, activities of parties and public movements and financing, legislative processes, the election of members of state-owned companies, heads of public bodies, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also proposed to consider the information provided by law enforcement and intelligence authorities to the competent authorities on how it was responded.
Researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
The presidential election campaign, the European Parliament, will take place at that time.
Of the 12 members of the Commission, seven are representatives of the "nationals".
Its members are also appointed two social workers, one "management", a liberal and a representative of Lithuanian Polish election campaigns-Christian Family Union.
Conservatives and social democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new study was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, Chairman of the Union of Governing Lithuanian Peasants and Greens.
According to him, the investigation carried out in the previous session by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) has shown, in principle, that the investigation should be continued on the same grounds.
German Domestic Intelligence Manager lost office
The 55-year controversy of Ms Maassen has also been provoked by a statement that his problems are caused by the "raditional left forces" in the Merkel Coallicia.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post, as promised earlier, but forced to leave the reserve.
Among other things, last weekend showed that Mr Maassen criticised Ms Merkel's immigration policy in Warsaw a few weeks ago.
For a long time, the German Minister for the Interior Horst Seehofer, who defended the Head of Intelligence, stated at the press conference on Monday that Mr Maassen's recent comments were inadmissible and 'personally disappointed'.
Seehofer, who himself had the pressure of both this dispute and the poor appearance of his party in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release Mr Maassen into the reserve.
Virtual shark attacks were intimidated by the whole island - a third person has already been tanned
The Queensland Emergency Service report states that the victim has experienced "serious legs and wrist wounds" in the area of Sid Harbor, near the Queensland State.
The man was transported by a helicopter to the hospital.
The Pentecost Island is the largest of the archipelago objects of the same name, attracting a lot of sailing and sailboats from all over the world.
Rice attacks in this region have so far been relatively rare.
In September 19, one woman was attacked in Sid Harbor and the 12th-year-old tourist was attacked in the same Bay on the next day.

Cloud girls destroy stereotypes about wedding dresses
A stubborn girl with a white blowing bride dress - mission (no) possible?
Can a white gulb floating towards the altar be larger than S or M size and still look attractive?
Plus the size of the reality show "Size (r) evolution" participants will already prove today that the beauty and elegance of the bride does not really depend on the woman's kilograms.
But it's not everything else - one of the project girls this evening will touch the tears of happiness - her boyfriend will appear on the filming site.
"There are those who think that bigger girls don't get the attention or look at the guys.
It's just a myth - my boy himself is a sportsman, but I like him what I am, he doesn't require a figure that meets any standards," Aurica will speak with a wedding dress before the show.
Wedding dress is not easy, with all meanings, clothes - it is a complex structure, there are many materials, dress hard, uncomfortable for movement.
Some women also think that the bigger girl in the white dress will look even bigger and therefore less trust in herself.
I can calm down that a well-selected dress model really solves this 'problem'," explained Robert Kalinkin, a fashion designer of the show commission.
Girls' destiny in the project R. Kalinkinas decides together with the entire commission - Erika Vitulskiene, the photographer and the social network star Nagliu Bierancu and the TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"When we decide which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there are many cruelties among the members of the commission - because we all represent different spheres and we imagine differently the winner of the show.
The task of demonstration of wedding dresses has been made more difficult, and that is - I can now reveal - that two new ones, which were certainly not worse than the old ones, appeared.
It was all the meanings of a special evening," says Mr Kalinkin.
In one summer reality show, Ieva and the mother Dovile of the 31-year-old exclusive beauty of two children, who were scandalously conducted in 23 years, participated in the selection of "Size (r) evolution" and came to the best twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photography of girls on the streets of Vilnius City, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls returned to the show by LNK viewers, for their favorite voice on the television portal.
After the international recognition of the realm of the cubic beautys in Lithuania, the second week is taking place - here the size of girls competes for the first country plus the size of the star's name.
So far only eight left, and they all understand that the winner will be only one.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Size (r) evolution" week begins this Monday evening at 20.30 a.m. during the LNK.
Actor I. Elba is chosen as the most sexual man in the world
The U.S. magazine People published the world's most sexual husband this year.
It became a 46-year-old British actor, Idris Elba.
Though the man says that this message was unexpected, he did not become foolish when he told about the new title.
I thought, "You can't be!
Seriously?"
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I look sexy, - when I laughed in sharing the actor.
By speaking openly, Idriss stated that this title was a very pleasant feeling that lost his ego.
The British star believes that it has often been a treacherous word and experience, which has made his childhood hard, because, as it is called, he was "very high and inexpensive".
The young actor did not believe and became an object of reliance and because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
"I just grew up the mosquito, and I became the most powerful guy in my city district," Idriss smile.
When a man loses his pride on the Osse screens, Mr Elba is working as a dinner in dinner in Spain, and especially in the surprising Ibiza.
A man enjoys a box of Thai in his leisure time and has a pot of fashion that is realised by creating his own line of clothes.
The British actor believes that his family is the most important thing in the world, so he is planning a wedding with the fascinating Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba has become the most sexual man in the world chosen by the 33th magazine People.
In 2017, the title was married to Blake Shelton.
In the area of Širvints, a man dying
On Monday evening in the region of Širvintai, a man was mortally confused in the drinking houses.
According to the police of Vilnius county, at 21.16 a.m. a report was received that during the drinkers the man killed the neighbor.
After the arrival, the doctor found the death of a man born in 1943.
Detained in 1994 a suspect with an established drunkenness of 2,53 away.
The police explain the circumstances of the event.
Managing authorities no longer require a distance of 20 km when building waste incineration plants
The cogeneration plant of Vilnius is built, near the Gariūnai market.
The rulers no longer seek to keep 20 miles [20 km] away from settlements in the construction of waste incineration plants.
The head of the Committee on Environmental Protection "National" Kęstutis Mažeika on Monday registered in the Seimas an amendment to the Waste Management Law which refuses such a requirement.
According to Mr Mazeika, the 'national' group, who has previously supported the provision for a distance of 20 km, promises to support the correction of its refusal.
The minoreic amendment provides that, as of January 2019, waste incineration plants can be constructed with the statutory environmental and public health requirements.
He admits that the amendments have led to the President's doubts about such a ban.
"Once taking into account the definition of the territory of residence, it is obvious that the location in which the above-mentioned objects could be built would be almost impossible to discover," the president of the Committee states.
The majority of Presidents opposed the President's veto's amendments in October to strengthen the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to the ban on the construction of waste incineration plants close to 20 km from settlements, the amendments provided for an authorisation to the Government to take decisions on the future of the two plants already built, taking into account the public health interests.
The last provision, Mr Mazeika, does not propose any adjustment.
The power plant is built in Vilnius by waste and biofuel generation by the Energy Group "Lithuanian Energy", and in Kaunas together with the Finnish Energy Group "Fortum" company "Fortum Heat Lietuva".
The latter already burns waste in Klaipeda.
Talking about a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on Monday on the complex issue of Northern Ireland, striking the Brexit negotiations, reported by Dublin.
When speaking on the phone, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a review of the so-called insurance mechanism, which would leave an open border between the United Kingdom's province of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland belonging to the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Waradkar promised to consider this proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from this agreement, as stated in the report published by the Irish Government.
In the interview Th. May, "the possibility of reviewing the mechanism of insurance measures has been made", refers to it.
"Waradwar has made it possible to understand the openness of the revision of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review is not linked to a unilateral decision to discontinue insurance measures", says the Government report.
The Brexit negotiations do not find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the land border between the United Kingdom and Ireland when Britain will leave the single market and customs union next year.
Both parties agree on "insurance measures" to maintain the open border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, pending the signing of a broader trade agreement, which must ensure that additional customs checks at the border are not carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants to apply them provisionally to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph announced on Monday that the Secretary of Brexit Dominic Raab seeks that Britain can withdraw from the insurance agreement unilaterally after three months.
However, Mr Varadkar told journalists in Dublin that his government could not support this.
"The three-month or limited-term insurance measures are not worth paper on which they will be written," he stated.
Previously, London and Brussels did not confirm the information on the breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations after the weekend report in Britain that the agreement was reached by hand.
'I would say that we are continuing to make progress in the negotiations, but there is still work,' said the representative of Th. May in London.
The European Commission representative Margaritis Schinas also said to journalists: 'We are not there'.
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
The group of leading thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, issued a declaration on Monday, calling for the right to receive reliable information in the Internet era.
Among the 25 signatories of the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are the economists Amartya Senas and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglic), the Iranian lawyer who earned the Nobel Peace Prize and the human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, as well as the winner of the Nobel Literature Prize Mario Vargas Llosa (Marijus Vargasas Liosa).
'We are creating the leaders of goodwill in all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debate, through which citizens can make decisions on the basis of facts,' says the Group's report.
They argue that the 'Global Information and Communications Space' is a common good that 'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and views'.
"People have fundamental rights to receive information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated on the basis of the truth of the commitment, principles of pluralism of views and rational methods of fact-finding", the authors of the declaration added.
The document seeks help from world leaders, including US President Donald Trump (Donald Tramp), who often criticizes 'unfair news', but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
The world leaders should express their position on this issue when they will meet on 11-13 November in Paris, called on the signatories to attend the Taikos Forum.
This declaration was drawn up within two months under the leadership of Mrs Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christof Deluar), the Head of Media Freedom and Journalists' Rights Protection Organisation (RSF) in Paris.
Among other signatories are former Senegal President Abdu Diufas, Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and politicallogist Francis Fukuyama.
The Seimas adopted higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas accepted amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provide that penalties for breaches of product safety should be increased.
The amendments were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Mr Vinkus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health, said, in relation to the new project, it is welcomed that the objectives put forward relate to better protection of the consumer of products.
Its provisions are also aligned with the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed draft law, is better and more specificly distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As the practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, because entities who have paid fines continue to commit repeated infringements," Mr Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Economy, after the approval of the Government, the Seimas Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments to the law aim at increasing penalties for infringements, strengthening consumer protection, giving more powers to market surveillance authorities and creating a clear system for monitoring compliance with product safety requirements.
According to the Ministry of Economy, producers are not currently subject to an appropriate labelling obligation in order to ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, the market surveillance authorities have not granted access to the territory of producers and suppliers, buildings, premises and inspections, which makes the work of the authorities difficult.
According to the Ministry's assessment, the six-month deadline for the imposition of fines and warnings is too short to detect, investigate and impose a fine.
Also, according to the Ministry, the fines imposed are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - 14 companies did so only in 2017.
The Ministry of Economy proposed that manufacturers should be obliged to properly label the product, so as to ensure its traceability so that market surveillance authorities can make it easier to clarify the suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right of access to the territory, buildings, premises and inspections of operators that produce, place products on the market, in the framework of public product safety controls.
It is intended to increase the amount of fines for infringements of the law.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who has placed dangerous products on the market and the distributor who has made the services available on the market would be fined from EUR 150 to EUR 2 500 (now from 144 to 1 448).
A fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (now between 868 and 4 344) would be imposed on the State Consumer Rights Protection Authority (PES) or the other market surveillance authority if it decided to prohibit the placing on the market and the provision of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services.
Failure to comply with the requirement to remove, recover and destroy dangerous products from the market would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6500 (now between 1 448 and 5 792).
If dangerous products have damaged the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (now between 1 448 and 11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (now between 5 792 and 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, a fine of up to EUR 25 000 is imposed for the breach of product safety legislation (the minimum amount is not fixed), in Belgium - from EUR 26 to EUR 600 000, in Romania - from EUR 155 to EUR 6 666, in Bulgaria - from EUR 125 to EUR 7 500.

Norwegian Armed Battalion participated in NATO exercises in the outermost and most remote areas
The troops from Norway participated in a series of complex exercises in mountains north of the capital of the country Oslo.
This is part of NATO exercises "Trišakė jungtis 2018" - the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
The majority of troops from the second Norwegian troops battalion spent a lot of time away from home, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in warm countries - after the 11th of September terrorist attacks.
But the most skilled are to fight in the Arctic conditions, and these skills are particularly useful now that NATO changes its focus direction.
In recent days, east of Tinsett in the mountains, often in the outermost and thriving areas, soldiers have participated in incensed fights against the real British troops.
The warriors have the skills to survive in this cold in wild nature, but in the warm climate they have to stretch a much higher weight on the shoulders - one hull weighs about 50 kg.
The leaders say that they share their skills in living and fighting under such conditions with other NATO troops.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like any other, are especially reminded of real warships, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

The Kaunas people, who noticed workers in Kaunas Castle, felt that the renovation of the remaining tower was finally carried out.
The director of Kaunas City Museum Gabrielius Sužiedėlis believed that there were works for changing the cover of the south-western tower with a fragment of the defence wall.
According to the conflict, roofs will be barrels.
"The deteriorated cord cover of an emergency was a threat to the surroundings - people were able to fall into and injure - so it was necessary to change it.
The roofs were no longer resistant to humidity, so it was damaged to heritage," explained the director of the museum.
Will these roofs be like those who were some centuries ago?
'All works are in line with heritage and other institutions,' Mr Injured added to the aim of making the result as authentic as possible, but at the same time important and practical: roof values must be protected from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen when working with heritage.
Before this, the elements of Kaunas castle were covered in the Soviet year, so they no longer had historical values," said the director of Kaunas City Museum.
The contract was signed on 2 October.
The work is expected to not be longer than three months after the signing of the contract.
"To be completed by the end of November," said the director of the museum.
According to him, the value of the works carried out is almost EUR 24 000.
This amount was set out in the budget for this year, according to the contest.
Works in Kaunas Castle are carried out by "Statija".

The RESC partners with which joint initiatives are being implemented are the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
