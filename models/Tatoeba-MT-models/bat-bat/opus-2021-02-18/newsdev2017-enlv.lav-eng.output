New questions on the California water supply project
The Critics and the legislator of the State says that they want to know more about who pays for the 16 billion US dollar project supported by Governor Jerry Brauna, after the California Water Administration's leading representative said that the Brauna administration offers government funding to complete the construction of two huge water tunnels.
The Critics claim that the government funding described by the Los Angeles metropolitan water supply administration may be contrary to the long-term claims made by the State that the various local water supply administrations, not California itself, would pay for Brauna's vision to extract two equal 35-mile tunnels to transport water south of the Sacramento river, mainly for Central and South California.
The initial cost of tunnelling of USD 248 million, which is still to be authorised by the supervisory authority, has already been launched by the Federal Audit Research Centre.
On Wednesday, the legislators of the State also commissioned a state audit on tunnel construction costs.
On Thursday, Nancy Vogela said that, despite the Los Angeles metropolitan water management account, the funds from the general budget of the State will not be used to complete the current programming phase of twin tunnels.
However, the Tunnel Opponents and a group of taxpayers were critical on Thursday, and the Assembly's representative Susan Ega, one of the legislators of the state-of-the-state audit ordered this week, asked for clarifications to the State on Thursday.
"It's a game with collectors," said David Volf, the legal director of Hovard Jervis's taxpayers' association.
In my opinion, it calls on yesterday's audit (requirement): there are more questions than answers.
The Tunnel project has been approved by Brauns and some politically influential water management and water consumers in Central and South California.
The supporters claim that tunnels will benefit the environment and provide a more secure supply of water to the California.
The opponents claim that they are concerned that the State will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and the San Francisco Gulf, harming North California and putting local species even more at risk.
Metropoles and other water administrations to receive water from tunnels still have to commit themselves to pay for them because of their insecurity about whether the investment of huge funds will actually give enough water to repay.
The same water administrations also announced this year that they would not pay for the completion of the current preparatory work, unless the project was first authorised by the monitoring authority.
On Thursday, the monthly report published by the Los Angeles Water Administration on the tunnel project states that "the State has indicated that additional funding for the completion of the planning phase will be provided from the state or federal budget."
After all that local water administrations have spent on the project, including $63 million from his water administration, "it is expected" that the state will use state money to complete the planning," said Bob Muirs, the Los Angeles Water Administration speaker.
Then he referred questions to Vogel, a sparker of the state.
Vogela said that the state intends to allocate funds to complete the tunnel planning from the fee for the current half-year old water network, the Station Water Project.
However, the opponents of tunnel construction point to the regulatory framework adopted in 2009, which, according to them, prevents the State from spending money on tunnel construction while the water supply authorities which will benefit from it will not assume a payment obligation for them.
"Project contracting entities have promised to pay for this project, and they have used financial tricks to circumvent these commitments," said Patricija Šiferle, environmental consultant and an ancient opponent of the planned tunnels.
This raises questions about where this money was suddenly found.
Entrepreneurship in the context of the Chinese Cybersecurity Act
The Coalition of International Business Groups has appealed to China with a request to amend the proposed cybersecurity rules to warn that they will harm trade and isolate the country.
The letter to the Chinese Prime Minister Li Kesjan has signed 46 groups from the USA, Europe, Asia and Latin America, showing global concern that the rules could restrict or suspend access to the Chinese information security product market.
Signatories include the US Chamber of Commerce, the European Service Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.
The proposed rules require suppliers to demonstrate to the Chinese authorities how safety products work and how information about Chinese citizens will be stored in the country.
The last letter dated Wednesday states that this could make theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.
Chemical explosion in Tianjina: year has passed since the tragedy
Zhang Mengfan claims that the public deserves to know what happened in Tianjina.
The Chinese leaders are planning quiet memories to mention a large-scale chemical explosion in which 173 people died, the first anniversary, but not everyone agrees.
John Sadvort reports from Tianjin.
Almost everywhere in the world, the anniversary of such a scale would be a moment that people remember and remember.
However, not in China.
Although the city of Taijin holds a memorial service for the memory of some dead firefighters, elsewhere such memorial activities are excluded.
The media controlled by the Communist Party have been told what they can and cannot say, and some survivors, as well as the family members of the dead, have been warned not to talk to the foreign press.
However, Zhang Mengfan, 23 years old, does not want to silence.
"This year, society should find out something about what happened," he says to me.
I don't want silence.
On August 12, last year, Zhang was a radio operator in the military firemen's team, which was only a kilometre from the explosion epicentre.
"The call was received tonight at 22.53, and we started sending my team members," he says.
They could come to the event within 10 minutes.
Commands from other locations of the city also urgently took place in the storage of large fires.
None of them took note of the fact that a large amount of volatile and toxic substances was illegally stored, well above the permitted levels and without proper monitoring.
The fire began when nitrocellulose - chemicals used in nail lakes - was allowed to dry, and then the party burns in summer.
Then it spread into a huge area - 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
In the explosives, the windows and fire depots were exploded, where Zhang Mengfan was waiting for radio messages from the event site, invaded the roof.
This information was also not received.
"When I saw the cloud of the mushroom, I fell into despair," he tells me.
I knew what this would mean to my friends.
Of the 26 firefighters of his unit that were sent to the explosion site tonight, eight were never returning.
Many others suffered serious burns and other injuries.
The largest of the two large explosions was likened to the earthquake, and the wave of explosion was felt at a distance of many kilometres.
The total loss is estimated at more than $1 billion, including more than €300 ruined buildings.
Overall, 173 people lost their lives, 104 of whom were firemen.
Eight humans have not found any mortal residues.
The investigative authorities of the official government are unambiguously guilty of corruption, political relations and of formal secret agreement, which allowed circumvention and ignorance of security systems.
First of all, such a warehouse had never to be built near homes.
A type of disciplinary or criminal investigation has been initiated against more than 100 officials and company managers.
Thus, while the government can point to the progress made - the thousands of houses and the compensations for the citizens in order, these sensitive issues are still topical.
The tragedy has revealed a gap in the system where rapid economic growth is a priority and lack of independent monitoring is a fact.
That evening’s courage and responsibilities are not questionable, but without a fireman’s image as a hero, it is not a very pleasant picture.
It contains a firefighter as a victim who has been sent unprecedented in the fight against a man-made disaster that could be prevented.
Zhang Mengfan no longer works in the fire service, but will visit the memorial service in Tianjina.
He will give a message in his heart about his deceased fellow believers.
I would like to say to them most: I have visited your parents and are good for them.
Leave your parents to me.
I am now a member of your family.
I will perform your duties as a son.
Cold spring could affect the shooting season of skewed rifles
The Scottish Rubber Shooting Season will start later, because the cold time has led to a fall in birds this year.
In several property, shooting has been delayed because many of the new rifles have not survived in cold spring conditions.
Marking the beginning of the season, the Scottish Player Association (SGA) says that rifle shooting provides more work than the Edinburgh festivals.
However, the Animal Protection Charity Fund OneKind calls for the end of the 'brutal killing of birds'.
Harry Huton, Director of the Organization, said: "The work that is invested in providing a large number of shooting game birds is huge and undoubtedly involves any quite controversial activities."
It is not surprising that society avoids this so-called sport and calls on the government to ban the cruel, unnecessarily work that only a very small proportion of Scotland's population enjoys.
The land owners both insist that they are committed to maintaining the number of birds and that the shooting of rubber is important for the development of the rural economy.
Alex Hogs, President of the SGA, said that the sector provides 8 800 full-time jobs per year in the outermost regions and that it has been a "rich work street" in unsafe times.
He said: "In comparison with many European countries, Scotland has not so rooted in the "medical" culture, and some people do not know how the shooting season affects the country in economic terms."
According to Hog, the number of jobs provided during shooting exceeds the number of jobs created at the Edinburgh International Festival, the French Festival, the tattoo festival and the Old Year's evening celebrations together.
He added: "The employment situation in Scotland is now very worrying, especially in the oil and gas sectors, so the players and their families want to see the prosperity of the sector.
We want to work with the Scottish Government to ensure that hard workers can also rely on these jobs in the future.
The RSPB Scotland believes that at least eight golden eagles have been killed in the vicinity of the rubens.
Many players admit that rifle shooting is not generally popular, but the SGA claims that the industry "has taken important steps forward in terms of best practice."
The opening day of the Rubber shooting season is traditionally known as "The Holy Twelve."
However, there are still many discussions on these sports, and the management of rubber shooting sites is linked to the persecution of certain natural defence authorities.
On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said that in less than five years, eight ringed golden eagles were missing in Mountains of Monadlia, southeast of Invernesa.
The charity fund of nature believes that they have been illegally killed in the vicinity of rifle shooting places and their satellite processes have been destroyed.
Scottish Minister for the Environment Rosanna Kaningema said that these reports are 'very worrying and disgusting'.
Mrs Kaningemas asked officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 survivors and missing eagles with transmitters to determine whether there is a trend in criminal activity.
The Scottish Cleaning Group blame the RSPB for trying to make the feelings of oppression before the beginning of the Rubber season, and said that there was no clear evidence that the birds would even have died in the Mountains of Monadlit.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Briony Peidgee United Kingdom wins silver in tramplin attack
United Kingdom Representative Peidgee wins silver in tramplin attack
Briony Peidgee became the first British woman who was at the medal in the Olympic Games of tram attack, Rio fighting silver.
Peidgees (25) to gold lacked 0.425 points because Canadian representative Rosanna Maclenana won the second Olympic title in a row with a result 56.465.
The World Championship, the Chinese representative of Lī Dana was at the bronze, while the second British finalist Ketrin Driskola finished in the sixth.
I can't believe I have won the Olympic medal.
I am so happy," said the emotional Peidgee.
I had no idea that it was a medal, but the ability to show the best performance, so I was so happy that all the exercises and hard work had been rewarded.
I am so glad that I could start the final with Keta, the participation of already one representative in the final would be historical, but we were there two.
Before the Olympic Silver won the Peidge's highest achievement in the international competition was the fifth place in the 2015 World Championship in Denmark.
Tramplin attacks were included in the Olympic Games in 2000, and this is the first time that British women have managed to finish.
Medal reaction.
The British team's representative, Natan Beily, the only representative of men's competition in tram attack on Saturday, was in extassion.
Hanna Velana, who participates in the second Olympic Games, quickly began to praise the achievement of Peidgee.
Peidgee has gained the Bachelor's biology with excellence at Shefyled University.
Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate golden medals in regbia-7
12-year-old boy to see the game, dilute half a mile both for sugar cane fields to the nearest television
Fiji begins with an unprecedented-scale celebration after the first Olympic Gold medal was won in its history
Banks closed, stores hard and celebrations took over the streets of Suva, dancing, singing and joking

Sounding the end of the game for the whistling, the excited celebrations went on the streets, joking and dancing.
"Some people, even in people's full streets of Suva, stopped their vehicles and joined the festivals with Fiji flags, not addressing the small congestion they caused," reports Fiji Times.
The celebrations will certainly continue on the weekend and next week.
Irish Prime Minister: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City
Aaron Makenef took two first half-time sentences for the guest team in Finnpark.
Derry City has risen to the second one in Prime Minister, gaining a convincing victory with the result of 5-0 in the fight against Finn Harps.
Aaron Makenefs brought the "confessional dispute" under the direction of successfully implementing the two first half of the penalty, which was awarded for violations against Lukas Schubert.
Nathan Boil took the gate at the beginning of the second half of the period, and Shūbert surrounded the opponent in the fourth quarter before Kitha Varda late bowl, closing the opponent's defeat in Finnpark.
Derry is on one point ahead of Cork City, and both teams will meet in a decisive game on Monday evening in Brendivele.
This was the first victory of Derry over its north-west competitors in this season, and they were disrupted to me on the side of HARPS.
Makenef saved the game opening crash 17 minutes after Cyrus Cole went out against Schubert, although the infringement turned out outside the courtyard.
There was no doubt about the second penal crash, the former "Karamel Dispute" cousin Barry Moloy making Shubert fall down and Makenef achieved the result 2-0 in the third minute after the break.
The Boil put the exact point after Dyna Jervis's bucket with the inside of the foot in the eighth minute after the game was resumed.
Derry City gate guard Jerard Dohertius had a calm evening, but he managed to perfectly protect the gate by overcoming David Scaley in the best opening of the game.
The Shubert took the ball past Cole 83 minutes ago and soon followed the Ward’s wise retreat over Harps’ centre guard Richard Brash.
It was the Derry's largest victory in the series of competitions and a great preparations for the closing game with Cork.
Examination following mass inconsistencies in the course of the University of Higher and Isles of the College of Invernesa (UHI)
All 20 students' courses could have gone out in the UHI Higher Media Course test of the Invernesa College.
Most of them were 17 and 18 years old students who were hoping to use the label they received to join the university.
UHI, the College of Invernesa, claims that quality assurance processes are applied, adding that the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) is investigating this case.
The SQA press secretary said that the highest media evaluation available throughout the country for 2016 was "notification as intended".
Twenty students signed the course offered and evaluated by UHI at the Invernesa College.
Many of the students were young people living in rural areas with online training, but often they had to go to Invernes College from their homes, such as Locheiber.
One student’s father said that after his daughter’s publications in the social media, at least 10 of her work had not been evaluated, she also made a statement that she had not received any assessment of her course work.
He said to BBC News Scotland directly, that some five more people who learned this course last year in the College of Invernes, and who managed to communicate with, said that the same has happened to them.
The situation means that his daughter cannot provide a place at the University of Glassgov, but she will be able to accept another university's offer thanks to the qualifications acquired in the school.
However, her father said that there were others who visited the media course organized by college, who did not succeed and who were now "forgot" and uncertain about whether their course work would be reviewed and evaluated with a mark so that they could join universities.
UHI of Invernesa College is part of the University of Highers and Islands.
Diana Rovlinsone, the head and executive director of the UHI College of Invernesa said: "We have the results of exams and the success of students is very important."
This is also confirmed by the excellent review of His Majesty Education Inspectorate (HMIE) received this year, as well as the improved levels of achievements both in further education and in higher education compared to the previous years.
As we have done every year, we carry out a review of all published results compared to each student's projected results.
In the case of this specific course, standard quality assurance measures were taken and the assessment body recently reported "significant improvements in the performance and management of this assessment" and confirmed that "the assessments were in line with national standards".
SQA is currently investigating this case at our request.
The SQA press secretary said: "We are glad that the highest media evaluation in 2016 has taken place as planned and that candidates had the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject."
Many candidates have shown good performance and there was a slight increase in the A-C performance indicator compared to the same qualification last year.
It was developed in accordance with previous and model documents and in accordance with our course and assessment specifications.
Brothers placed in prison for the samjure sword "blood alcohols" in Kilmarnok
Jason Braiden was attacked by the sword of the samurai, the knife, and the nunches.
Two brothers in prison for the killing of a man with a samurai sword after the drug-related stolen in Airshire, which turned out to be a blood-spirit.
The victim Jason Braiden (38) was repeatedly struck in his home in Kilmarnock on July 5, 2015.
James Clark (36) will be sentenced to the High Court at least 22 years after the death sentence.
His brother John (38) was sentenced to 10 years in prison after having been sentenced to a less serious accusation of killing without prior intention.
By imprisoning both men in prison, judge Bill Danlop told his brothers that they had committed a "greedy, cruel and wildly attack."
He rejected any assumption that Mr Braiden was sleeping and waiting for them, armed with the sword of the samurai.
Judge Danlop added: "You plan to enter together illegally with at least one knife and nunchaki."
Jason Braiden may have been a drug dealer, but he was a son, father, and friend.
You lucked him.
After both men were imprisoned in prison, the criminal police officer who led the investigation said: "John and James Clark's violent and terrible actions have caused Jason Braiden's death."
Come on, under such terrible conditions, in their 38 - year - old, there is a heartfelt situation that the family needs to survive.
The Court heard in advance that the brothers from Kilmarnock decided to abduct Mr. Braiden the golden robber that they had given him in exchange for drugs.
Both of them went to their homes, masked their faces with scarves, and armed with a knife and a eastern fight against nunckeys.
It is believed that the sword used in murder belonged to the deceased.
The neighbors said that they saw Clark attacked Brian when he sat on the sofa at the window and heard him crying.
Prosecutor Richard Godard said at the hearing: "The attack on this man was endured, chaotic."
Then the place of murder was described as a "blood alcohol".
In addition to the injuries of the knife's stunts, Braiden suffered a strong injuries with a tricky object during the attack.
Three days later, he died in Kilmarnock’s Hospital.
Both brothers did not accept murder.
To provide evidence, James Clark, who has previously been judged 38 times, including about the attempt to kill, said: "I didn't want it, it was an accident."
John Clark, who has already been judged 23 times, said that he was just involved in helping a brother who, according to him, was attacked by Braiden."
The husband was sentenced to prison for shaking and killing his baby's son
David Sinkler recognized his fault in the murder of a child in his home in 2012 in Ītkilbraid.
A man who shot and killed his baby's child's anger in an outbreak because he did not want to eat will be sentenced to seven years and three months in prison.
David Sinkler shot four months old Joshua, when "on a moment he lost control" at their home in Ītkilbraid, South Lancashier, December 6, 2012.
The cause of death was established only after judicial medical examination.
Sinkler (34) was initially accused of killing but was found guilty of killing without prior intention.
At the High Court of the Gulf, judge Breissil Sinkler said: "You are attacking your baby's son shot him, creating the injuries from which he died."
When you shake him, you had to know it, but you didn't reveal it.
Only after thorough medical examinations you are aware of what you are doing.
Your wife believed you.
Now she feels handed over and can no longer support you.
Lord Breissydl described the consequences of Joshua's death as 'catastrophic' for all, and added: 'No more will go back Joshua'.'
The court had previously found that on the day when the child died, Sinkler and his wife, Kärstiy, had went with Joshua to swim and buy in the Trutkilbraid.
17:30 Cassia Sinkler went to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later, Sinkler called her, who sounded "thinked".
He said to her, "The Jehouah doesn't breathe like he's coming, come home right away."
Then he finished the conversation and called to 999.
The infant was immediately taken to the Hermaira Hospital, where he died.
At first, the cause of Joshua’s death was not clear, but it was examined by a team of judicial medical experts who found the consequences of injuries in the eyes and in the brain shortly prior to death, and such injuries were not accidental.
One of the experts, Dr. Peter Richard, counseling child neurosurgeon at the John Redcliff Hospital in Oxford, said: "It has happened because the child has been shaken and thus injured, as well as more forced than every day."
The defence representative Jan Djūgid told the court that Sinkler "repented" of what he did.
Rio Olympic Games 2016: Hloja Tatone threatens the position of Jūlija Jefimova
British representative Tatonei runs out of hand in the bronza 200 m swimming
The British representative Hloja Taton criticizes the participation of Jūlija Jefimova, a controversially evaluated swimming member, in the Rio games after the Russian representative surprised him in the 200 meters swimming.
Jefimova, which was authorised to participate in the games following the complaint submitted on the prohibition of participation due to doping, won silver, leaving Tatoni in the fourth place.
"I would have wanted them to be completely clean games," then said the 20-year-old Walesian swimmer.
I didn't know who's going there.
I'm not satisfied with it, but that's what it is.
Jephimova, who won the second place, only three days ago learned about her participation in the games.
I don't want to see how people get out of sport, but I don't think it's really right.
She did not have to participate in the competition, and the 20 - year - old British representative had to win a medal.
Rie Kaneto won Japan the seventh golden medal in the 2016 games Rio, overcoming Jefimova, which was at the silver medal.
China's representative, Genlinga This was at the bronza, just for six seconds in hundreds of surprises to the fourth one left in Tatoni.
Her British teammate, 20-year-old Molly Renschova, finished in the sixth.
"Hearing in the fourth place is a little disappointment, whatever you have in front of," said Taton.
It's a great experience, and I'm a little disappointed about the fourth place.
I'm so close to the medal, and it would have been a dream.
However, the final meeting itself is a great experience that I will take with myself for the years to come.
It was a slight disappointment, but in the long term it will make me strong, and it makes me ever more seeking a medal, so I hope I'll get closer to it next time.
The tattoo was only 0.01 second behind the British record for women in the 200 m bathing finish.
"Everyone must give another chance," Jephimova.
Jephimova, who said that he had already been tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended his right to start Rio.
In 2013, she was subject to a 16-month ban after her body found anabolic steroid foot.
The Sports Arbitration Court (CAS) has established that athletes cannot be denied participation in the Rio game because they have already been sanctioned in advance.
CAS examined my complaint, and I won.
If someone does not like it and someone has a different viewpoint, they can turn to CAS," she explained.
I do not support doping, and I have never used it.
In the second case, it was certainly not my fault.
Everyone has to give another chance.
When you're going and you're extracting a queue, nobody's putting you in prison.
Ben Prauds wins 50 free-style swimming
Earlier, a British record was installed to win a place in the 50m free-style bathing finish.
The Union champion, Prauds (21), was distanced in 21.54 seconds, so that as the fifth most qualified Friday final (BST 02:44 Saturday).
Your delegation is shameless and gross
The Indian Sports Minister, Viajs Goels Rio, has been a very degrading personality in the Olympic Games, often in tribunals, encouraging Indian athletes and taking selfies after their beginnings.
However, he and his wide company obviously have caused anger by the Olympic Games organizers due to their inconsistent behaviour, repeatedly trying to break up to the competition areas without adequate accreditation and in a massive response, being tested, tells the Indian news agency Press Trust of India.
Viaj Goel, photographed in July, justifies his behaviour.
On Wednesday, the organisers of the Olympic Games threatened to cancel Goel's accreditation if his behaviour did not improve by sending a warning letter after he and his company tried to enter restricted access zones at the place of the exercise competition and in the arena where the flowering and bouquet is taking place.
"We have received several reports that your sports minister has tried to enter accredited competition zones with persons without accreditation," says Sara Peterson, Continental Manager of Rio 2016 organizing committee.
When the staff tried to explain that it was not allowed, people together with the minister became aggressive and rumorous, and sometimes lost our staff.
"If our protocol team becomes aware of any further cases of such behaviour, your sports minister's accreditation will be cancelled and his privileges in the Olympic Games will be cancelled," mentioned in the letter.
The leader of the Indian delegation called this case "a elephant exploded from the moss", and Goels himself said that he did nothing bad by writing it all as "a misunderstanding".
In the Twitter he wrote: "However I know we have complied with all the rules.
We are living in the spirit of the Olympic Games and supporting our Indian athletes.
Otherwise, this Olympic game is quite rude for India, yet there is no medal.
The fans in social media who lost their hope pointed out that Michael Felps has won so many medals - 26 - like India in its history.
Several prominent candidates have already been excluded, including the shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won a golden medal in Beijing in 2008.
This time he remained the fourth.
The money and opportunity has been launched in the wind," the author of the sardonic twisted article and the author of the columns Šoba De.
However, some of the hopes still remain, because there will still be competitions in boxes, golf, tennis, lightness and, yes, badminton.
The only Indian exerciser Dipa Karmakar will compete in the final jump on Sunday, showing his terrible double turn "Death jump", Produnova jump, which has been tried by only a few other exercisers.
In a country with 1.25 billion people, the low number of medals that have been fighted by India has always been a cause of sorrow.
Analytics say that there are countless reasons for this.
National passion is a kriket, which is not an Olympic sport.
India has not made a thorough investment in infrastructure and Olympic training - the first exercise tool in Karmakar was made from the reserve parts of the old skutter.
Parents have always emphasised the superiority of academic knowledge over sport.
And the authorities responsible for sport have been taken over by corruption.
The International Olympic Committee has deferred the Indian Olympic Association for infringements of its statutes in 2012, as it elected the leaders against whom criminal matters have been proposed.
In fines, three participants in the Indian winter Olympic Games were even denied to represent their country, wear their flag or wear anything with their symbols.
They competed as independent athletes.
When people are injured, the turbulence shot JetBlue plane on the route Boston-Sakramento is forced to land in South Dakota.
The JetBlue aircraft was forced to take an emergency landing on Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento.
Flight 429 from Boston to Sacrament died in Rapidsitia, South Dakota, shortly before 19:30 evening after local time.
The airline says that the injured were sent to the hospital for inspection.
JetBlue claims that it has sent staff to help the injured, has departed to Rapidsitia from a spare aircraft to deliver other passengers to Sacramento.
The drug control agency (DEA) misses the opportunity for medical marijuana
The answer, unfortunately, is that it is unlikely.
This is a loss of chance, which may result in further delays in the provision of treatment to a number of people.
Until today there is only one source of medical marijuana for scientific purposes approved at federal level in Mississippi University.
It seems to be a little positive today that the DEA also announced that it would now allow other locations to apply for the same authorisation.
It is hoped that the volumes and diversity of marijuana available for scientific purposes could expand.
Although it will attract attention as a emphasis on the study, it will largely be symbolic, because, regardless of how many marijuana are available if access to it remains difficult, it does not matter.
Imagine a product that is very demanded, but is stored behind closed doors.
In response to the demand for a product, someone takes a difficult and comprehensible decision to produce it more, but to be and never disconnect the door.
This product is marijuana and its location in list 1 is these locked doors.
In such an unpleasant situation, there is a medical marijuana.
Since marijuana is a substance included in list 1 (i.e. it is defined as 'no medical use currently approved and there is a high potential for its use for unforeseen purposes'), there are significant barriers to dismantling the door.
Potential researchers usually turn to the DEA first because they are authorised to launch scientific research.
Even if the investigation of substances included in list 1 is authorised, the authorities must comply with very strict safety rules and establish high-level safety systems, which may be costly.
There is also the most subjective consideration of the authorisation from its academic body to carry out research primarily on substances included in list 1.
Even if individual faculty representatives want to carry out this study, the university's management may not want problems or any potential side effects due to negative press reports.
This was the case at the University of Arizona, when Dr. Sju Sisley was released from office after efforts to advance the tests of medical marijuana.
After all, Sisley had to seek private funding for its project, and only in April, seven years after the original project was proposed, her project became the first DEA-approved medical marijuana test to prevent post-traumatic stresses for veterans.
The National Institute for Drug Addiction has then been at the last key of a year's fight against bureaucratic barriers.
At present, it is the largest federal public funder of marijuana research and is the only supplier of marijuana itself.
Even if studies have a higher amount of medical medicine in free circulation, the Institute will still have to approve all studies it finances.
However, the problem is the 'abuse' in its name.
Dr. Donalds Eibrams, representative of the University of San Francisco, interviewed to his documentary "Marihuana", says that the main task of the Institute is to study substances in the context of their potential dependence, not as medicines.
The European Union draws attention to an important fact.
Even if the study overcomes all the obstacles listed above, the doors can still be closed if the intention is to study the benefits of medical marijuana rather than the damage caused by it.
Note that 1 434 work on medical marijuana was found in the United States National Medical Library in the fast search (and not known as non-scientific) over the last five years.
In the same search, only 57 works benefited from medical marijuana.
Most of the studies were on the damage caused by marijuana, such as "Blog travel due to the anticholinergic effects of marijuana", "Marijuana-induced pancreatitis" and "The use of Marijuana and the risk of lung cancer."
Such disproportionality creates a completely distorted picture.
The path to the use of medical marijuana is tried by surprises and hypocrisy wherever the view is open.
While DEA is present in list 1, without looking at medical effects, the U.S. Department of Health and Social Affairs at the same time retains a cannabis patent for large-scale medical purposes.
DEA continues to set marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as a drug with high dependency potential, although DEA’s main judge of administrative law Frensiss Jangs opposed it.
In strict medical terms, marijuana is safer than many widely consumed foods.
For example, apparel of 10 fresh potatoes can cause toxic reactions.
In comparison, it is physically impossible to eat so many marijuana to come to death.
Marihuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutic substances known to humans.
In a rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used in the treatment by appropriate monitoring.
Again, this was proposed by the judge of the DEA itself.
And however, almost 30 years later, little has changed.
Whether we are aware of it or not, we all accept some hypocrisy in our daily life.
Maybe we do not always have energy to express it loudly, or we are such a mom or stupid that no one seems to have noticed it.
As regards hypocrisy in the context of federal medical marijuana policy, there must be endurance to present the facts worryingly.
Patients' lives, such as Charlotte Fiji, whose attacks are reduced by medical marijuana, and many others' lives depend on it.
It is worth talking at a higher level about the fact that plants can bring so much benefits and remain behind closed doors.
Bloody Beetroots: Donalds Tramps "Blond Berluskoni"
Bloody Beetroots is known in the context of electronic dance music
Music says Tramp is dominated in media like Berlusconi
You know, we have accustomed to Berlusconi in Italy, and I have Tramps looked like a blond Berluskoni," the founder of the electronic music pancakes association "The Bloody Beetroots" said CNN.
The candidate for President of the Republican Republicans and the Italian media magic became politicians, both of whom are known to be their exaggerated personality, the ability to attract the press attention and the transformed stories in the media.
"Bloody Beetroots" in Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with various artists, starting with legendary Ser Pol Makartnia and ending with the electropop singer Greta Svabo Beču in 2013 in the song "Chronicles of a Fallen Love".
Rifo was born in the Italian city of Basano del Grapa, near Venice in 1977, which roughly coincides with the time of the emergence of pancrocco, and the figures "1977" were placed on the chest by a musician.
"The English language is not my native language, so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said, hiding behind the black fee with which he is known.
I try to explore, and I have tried to improve my understanding of your culture.
Rifo invited Americans to look at the "Videocracy", a documentary film that explores Berluskoni monopoly over Italian media.
The documentary is about how "Berluskoni made Italy a crazy," said Rifo, adding that Tramp has had similar effects on America.
"You see how a person can turn the system completely and locate everything... through his own," he said.
I think Tramp is not good for this country.
Two Turkish seafarers in prison for more than 500 million pounds
Two Turkish men were sentenced to the smuggling of cocaine worth more than 500 million pounds on the North Sea, each in prison for at least 20 years.
Mamin Sahin and Emin Ozman were found guilty of the case before the High Court in Glasgow after three tonnes of class A drugs were found about 100 miles from the Aberdeen coasts on the SME Hamal deck.
In 2015, the detention is the largest cargo of one-off detained cocaine that has ever been detained at sea in Europe.
Mamin Sahin and Emmin Ozmen were sentenced to prison for their role in a large-scale drug deal
The significant load of drugs found on board is one of the largest in British history
Narcotics were found in a hidden hid in a specially built ski on a tug registered in Tanzania that sailed from Istanbul to Tenerifi and then to the North Sea.
It was suspended by the British fleet fregate "HMS Somerset" and border boat "HMC Valiant".
Sahins (47) was sentenced to 22 years, and Ozmens (51) is sentenced to the Supreme Court of Glasgow for 20 years.
Judge Lord Kinkleiven said to men that the amount of drugs was "not only significant but ambitious", and drug trafficking has a "destructive effect" on people and the surrounding society.
He said: "You were involved in a commercially vigorous operation, including the transport of cocaine by a ship, an operation that crossed internationally and truly intercontinentally."
He said that Captain Sahin was not at the end of the drug tree, but he played a key role in the crime, while the second captain, Ozman, had a role to be "almost smaller".
The inspectors climbed on the Hamal deck following the conductive information from the French customs office DNRED, and when they joined Aberden, they drilled through the steel plate, accessing a secret compartment where 128 cocaine-weighted cocaine was found to be 3,2 tonnes, with an estimated value of GBP 512 million in the black market.
The SME Hamal was tested last year by the Royal Fleet.
There were three tons of cocaine on board.
Inspecting the vessel, it was found that its ballast tanks were rooted in tonnes of class A drug
The ship was on the way from the Bosphorus Sea Square to South America before it was stopped in the North Sea.
Access to this site was discovered under the cabinet in one of the crew's team rooms, and the gap was seized.
Sahins and Ozman were found guilty of the transport and hiding of cocaine on board the ship from 20 February to 23 April last year and of the delivery of cocaine between 21 April and 23 April.
Both unsolicited men who have been working in the shipping sector since the end of the school continue to claim that they are not guilty, but accept the sworn judgment.
There is no evidence of complaints against four more men.
Sahin's lawyer Johnathan Kraw, said that the married father of two children is a "glorified moon".
He said, "What was involved in the transport of drugs."
Someone who was able to drive the ship.
Looking at the drug hierarchy, Sahin is certainly not at the end of the drug tree, but at some point below.
The huge amount of cocaine on board means that it has to be lifted by road
For days, the police passed through the whole ship before the drug was divided into these boxes
Sahina asked questions about his captain's work to Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.
Mr Krova said that it was "shocked" about passing through important daughters (9) and son (13) and "simply wanting to go back to Turkey".
Both men have not seen their families since their arrest in April 2015, because their families are still struggling to obtain visa endorsement.
Ozmen's lawyer Di Mur said he's "missile" wants to see his family, but he knows that in a transparent future it's "will not be possible".
After today's judgements, Scottish Prosecutor David Harvey said: "International drug trafficking has no borders, and we, whose task is to destroy it, are working more and more together to ensure that we are one step ahead.
"Scottish success in persecuting criminals is indeed global, and in this case we have caused significant economic damage to the representatives of organised crime."
Narcotics were gathered in all wings on the ship, including under the floors.
Inspectors of this smuggling parcel found a hidden ship laundry room
Mr Harvey added: 'Hamal' was identified according to Intelligence guidance from the French authorities, and following rapid cooperation with the Prosecutor General of Tanzania where the ship was registered, who also allowed the boarding of the ship.
"Our investigations then came from Giona, which provided access to essential data on consignments, to Spain, which provided us with very valuable information about the stopping places of the ship in the Canary Islands.
We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to combine specific elements of evidence.
Despite the insight into the fact that Hamal is carrying a large amount of drugs, representatives of the British authorities in international waters could not climb on it without the permission of the Tanzania Government - something that they had never previously granted.
Sjū Peitena, Head of International Justice and Organised Crime of the Royal Criminal Prosecutor (CPS), said: "As soon and accurately acted, the CPS Criminal Law Advisor managed to obtain the Tanzania authorities permission to climb on board within 24 hours of receiving intelligence information.
In accordance with international maritime law, British officials shall not be entitled to climb in international waters on board a vessel under the flag of another State unless that State grants a special legal permission to do so.
Without the rapid action of our advisor on criminal law, there would be a high risk that the ship could escape and that we could never call these people into charge.
Photographer Braiens Romeidžns emphasizes the fallen "Eastern Express" train
Photographer Braiens Romeidžns from Rotterdam has taken pictures of this abandoned train in Belgium
Figures show the humidating inside of the train, the crash seats, the dust windows and the narrow driver's cab
It has already been named the Eastern Express Wagon, but it belonged to the Belgian national railway company.
The city scientist has taken these remarkable photos that show that the residues of a passenger train that once was one of the best ways of movement have been lost.
Its flowers have long passed, and the train wagon and locomotive have been abandoned to blow the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular object of visiting photographers and adventure seekers.
Photographer Braiens Romeidžns, 40, has taken these terrible photos, showing the inner of the staircase of the train, crash seats, dust windows and compressed driver's cab
The train wagon and locomotive are left to blow the train depot in Belgium, where they have become a popular object of viewing photographers and adventure seekers.
These trains were a symbol of luxury when they acted with legendary names between 1883 and 2009.
The locomotives were used by the Belgian national railway company approximately 50 years ago.
After 126 years, the last train operating under the Eastern Express name went from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, concluding the famous stage of history.
The Eastern Express was famous for the route Paris - Istanbul.
When it was started in 1883 (operator - La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Liths) it was known as "Express d'Orient" in French.
It became an Eastern expression in 1891, and by 1930 it already had regular routes across Europe.
It should not be mixed with the private "Venice Simplon-Orient-Express".
There's very little left in Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits luxury wagons.
In this photograph, measuring instruments and open wires are still installed in the narrow driver's cab in which the equipment is rubbed.
Romeidžn said that the driver's cab was "softly klaustrophobic, and locomotive noise was probably inconsistent."
The lost locomotive and wagon have become a popular object of viewing photographers and adventure seekers.
After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeindžs MailOnlineTravel said: "I really could feel how it was used in its flower times."
For the rich, the lords join the beautiful dresses in high hats.
Grima Artmy Ketrins Gelovejs turns the series "Arrested Development" to Baster Blute
Thanks to her impressive grinding skills, reviews and transformations, the teksasiete and YouTube censone Ketlin Geloveja have met the fan army.
However, her last transformation of Baster Blut from Arrested Development is quite incredible for any standard.
In a three-minute video uploaded on her Kiki G YouTube channel, Gelovay slowly and continuously turns itself into a failed image with a hook in the hand.
Even at the end of the clip, she uses some audio recording from the show in terrible but at the same time in great execution.
The talented grind artist starts her video in her blond woman's image.
Then, with the slow photos, she slowly turns into a brutal "memme's son", which is already getting back from hair, and who is Tony Heil Baster Blut.
Geloveja is doing this with colorful contact lenses, hunting and pulling contours around the nose and eyes, and drawing the face of Baster on her head.
Wise methods: By using wisely slowed photography, she turns slowly into Tony Heil Baster Blutt.
Throughout her videos she also takes the character of the television image and the manieres, with the appropriate drawing of the chin.
YouTube has seen more than 45,000 clips, and very quickly the commendative comments of the artwork artist appeared:
"You are extremely talented," one person wrote the video inserted under Gelovy.
During her video she also takes a cult of TV image personality and manieres
"I like you doing everything in the picture," someone else added.
Videoblogere Ketlin Geloveja had been successfully transformed into "Parks and Recreation" image Ron Svenson.
She said to her followers of YouTube that she hoped to make a grown change every week in the future.

Lashanshire father is expelled from a child school on T-shirt with lama names
Two children's father has been expelled from the children's school on arrival on their sports day in T-shirt with an injurious inscription.
Kreigas Makbets (36) from Lashanshire, says he's "unintentional" wearing a shirt with the inscription "Low and Dr.A."
However, despite the fact that when he noticed his missile and wrapped T-shirt vice versa, on the next day he found that he was banned from entering the school territory.
A lonely father who has worked for four years as the primary school leader of Park in Colne, the child, could not come after children because of the ban, and the staff even called social services and the police.
Craig Macbet (36) of the Children says he was not in the school territory after the child's sports day had arrived in the inflatable T-shirt.
Mr. Babyley accuses directors of the school Sarah Midjill too sharply respond.
He says he's unjustifiedly punished for the fact that, before going to watch his two children's race, the mistakes after a hurry have pulled the T-shirt.
The father, who no longer works as a school leader, said, "It was a mistake and an obsession on my part."
I don't think about the day of sport, and I hurried when I wore it.
We had a father race near the end of the event, and the director noticed my T-shirt and said that it was not appropriate.
I'm sorry and cut it off to the other side, and this also ended up.
However, a 36 - year - old man said that he had received a letter from the school leaders to meet the Director on the next day, but he did not see the need to do so because he had already apologized.
"Then the director of the school called me and said that I was banned from entering the school territory," Mr. Bērnley added.
I learned that after the day of sport some parents on Facebook had raised their anxiety and that many people were interested in it.
Any person who thinks that it is overly exaggerated.
Mr Makbeta, who is editor of the online magazine Love Mini, said that he believed he could not even come after children on the last day of the semester because of the ban.
However, it was a reason for calling from school and social services.
On the T-shirt was Kreiga Charles image Listers of the BBC Cult commedium "Red Wolf" with one of his iconic expressions "Time and Dr.A."
He commented: "I told them that I wasn't there because I'm banned to enter school.
Then I was called from the social services and asked why I wasn’t after my daughter.
The school also called the police because I hadn't come after the daughter for some 40 minutes."
Mr Makbeta claims that he was told that he could no longer enter school premises and that the ban would be valid until further notifications were made.
He also said that he was warned that he would be able to apply a fine of GBP 500 if we were caught in breach of this rule.
Sarah Midgley, Director of the Park Primary School, said that this case has now been closed.
Sarah Midgley, Director of the Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr Makbeta has resigned from office and is no longer the leader of our school."
This thing is now closed, and I hope to return to the usual school life in September."
Junior City Advisor Joe Couny said that the school had clear policies and guidelines.
"We all have to bear in mind that when you take up posts such as a consultant or a manager, you are subject to higher standards, and unfortunately this time he did not comply with these standards," he said.
The counselor Johnathan Nikson added that he did not think that the school had to apply the ban and that a bruise was exaggerated from the moss.
Mr. Nicson added: "This T-shirt was foolish, and he also apologized for it."
The Lashanshire police confirmed that they were calling from school, but they did not arrive.
In recent years, there have been renovation of the former factory's VEF premises in the street of Freedom - there are several IT companies, the industry has already started to call this territory the local valley of Silicon.
The rest of the VEF territory, including Berzaunes, will also be developed.
The project development and construction of the 2nd stage of the LU Academic Centre in Torniskalns will cost EUR 21 million.
The procurement of the Academic Centre in Torniskalns, Riga, the development, construction and author's supervision of the technical design of the 2nd stage of the project is closed by the University of Latvia, as shown in the notice on the Procurement Supervisory Office's website.
Procurement shall be organised in the form of a negotiated procedure without prior publication of a contract notice.
The contract will be concluded with the full company LNK Industries group, which committed to doing these works by EUR 21 186 560.
As explained by LU, the University continues designing, monitoring and construction of the next stage of the Academic Complex – the Science Centre building – by launching the planning and implementation of the projects of the European Union funds for the 2014-2021 programming period, according to the Skiču project and the revised construction meta.
The building of the Research Centre is similar, according to the nature of the main activity it carries out, to the building of the Natural Sciences Academic Centre designed and constructed in the first stage and to the activities to be carried out there, which are similar in terms of the most important technical and technological parameters, as well as in terms of the scientific and academic staff and the number of students in the building.
The competition regulation was accompanied by the Sixth-style project developed by SIA, which provided information on the development vision of the University of Latvia Academic Centre in Torņkalns, including the list of objects planned by the University of Latvia Academic Centre, indicating the name of each individual object, the intended area of the object, the planned year of the release of the object into service and other information.
At the end of 2015, the Sixth style of the building complex area of the previously developed Academic Centre of Latvia in Torniskalns, which led to the clarification of the location and interconnection of buildings of the Academic Centre, as well as the organisation of transport in the area of the meta and its surroundings.
Announces the competition for the lawn mowing in the lanes of the road compartment.
The VAS Latvian road manager has announced procurement for mechanised lawn mowing in the road sections in the regions of Latvia and Pieriga, informs LAU.
The object of the procurement is divided into 9 lots: Alūksnes, Daugavpils, Jēkabpils, Jelgava, Rēzeknes, Valmiera, Talsi and Riga road areas.
Tenderers may submit a tender for one or more lots.
The weaning of medicines in road sections is necessary in order to improve the transparency of roads for drivers and their neighbouring areas, to promote water output from the road, as well as to limit the sowing of the medicine and the formation of the moist.
The most important lawn mowing works for farmers are designed in the Talsi Road Region for a total of 28 roads of 637 kilometres, Valmiera Road Region for 20 roads of 432 kilometres and Alūksne for 17 roads of 384 kilometres.
It has already been reported that the company completed the lawn mowing works on the main and most important regional asphalt roads of the country in June, but on smaller regional roads and on local roads, the VAS Latvian road manager planned to entrust part of the mowing work to farmers.
"We are able to make more efficient use of the funding allocated to road maintenance works, while allowing farmers to fully load and earn the technology", says Vladimir Kononov, Chairman of the Board of the VAS Latvian Roads.
The time limit for the submission of tenders shall be 22 August.
Ombudsman: Demagogy on the model of compulsory health insurance with an additional financial burden for citizens does not hold any criticism.
In any demagogia on compulsory health insurance, which would impose a direct and high burden of payment on the population, no criticism is held by law enforcement officer Juris Jansons.
Mr Janson met today with the Minister for Health And Chaksh to discuss the situation in the health sector.
After the meeting, Janson told journalists that the model of funding for the sector, proposed by the Minister of Health, was a sustainable and developed health system, making it more accessible to patients.
He noted that there was a need to talk about additional funding for health care in this case, as it is currently insufficient.
Mr Janson also stressed that any demagogy on compulsory health insurance that would impose a direct and increased payment burden on the population does not endure any criticism, especially when the Dutch model is called upon.
Mr Janson said that the Netherlands has 11% of gross domestic product for health, while Latvia has only 3%.
Thus, the government and Parliament must be sufficiently responsible to understand that this point of freezing should be raised, expressed by the law enforcement officer and added that otherwise the model proposed by the Ministry of Health (VM) would not work.
Chaksh thanked the law enforcement officer for his support and pointed out that the main concern is that the patient should be approached by a doctor, which in turn means that the healthcare system needs additional funding.
The Minister pointed out that with the planned additional EUR 35 million next year, only the most acute cases for oncological patients and the remuneration of maternity professionals will be possible.
Consequently, VM has developed a plan and requested an additional EUR 41 million for healthcare in order to reduce the number of specialists and investigations.
"The question of priorities, whether or not it will be available," said Čaksh.
This does not include an increase in the remuneration of doctors.
Commenting on the fact that medical practitioners are not delighted that all three options of the health financing model, including what provides for additional payments to patients, were guided by VM for government examination, Čaksh said that the government was given the opportunity to choose when using all three models.
Janson also added that by driving all three models, it is possible to show clearly that Latvia is not ready to impose an additional burden on the population.
It has already been reported that VM will defend the option of the health financing model which does not provide for a total increase in the tax burden, but requires a part of the social tax to be channelled to health, says the conceptual report summary "On the change in the financing model of the Latvian health system".
At the same time, the Ministry pointed out that the best option of the health financing model would be chosen as a result of the discussions by the end of September.
Local archives are ready.
Rolands Dambis, the owner of Arai, the municipality of Grobiņa Medze, is recognized by Arbūzi this year.
Arbūzas are already purchased on the Liepaja market.
A number of early breeds have started to produce, but more late balls have gone well, reports the regional newspaper Course Time.
"This year the arbūza grows better than last year," says the giant berries grower in the region of Rucava Artis Kūsis.
In terms of weather conditions, it is also a much more favourable summer than in the past when it was cold and windy.
The visits of Liepaja Theatre are started in Riga.
On August 12 and 13, the Theatre of Liepaja will be visited in Riga, offering both the performances given for the award of the "Amber Night" and the bright intrigue - Herbert Laukšte, Director of the Theatre of Liepaja, the representatives of the theatre inform the portal "Delfi".
On the evening of August 12, the viewers will be displayed in a human drama "Ziloņmans", inspired by director Laura Groza-Kibere.
This is a story of a real historical person - John Merick - who lived in the Victoriian era in London and in his crop, because of the deformed body of the inherited disease, was called the Ziloan man.
In the study, the title is reproduced by actor Egon Dombrovskis, who received the "Game Actor" nomination of "Merika's Night".
As his performance was described by the critic Normund Akott, Maryk is a role "through the heart released" in which the born image cannot be reproduced".
On August 13, the "Portreti" will be offered to the viewers.
The exhibition received six nominations of "Monning Night", including "Major Form Exhibition of the Year".
The director created the installation as a unique portrait gallery, giving equal importance to every play image, so each of them has both a centre and a background.
The exhibition consists of a number of minimal shows that end up in a single whole.
It is an observation of the nature of a man, where the main conflict is between true emotions and cold-assisted calculations, exposing a brightly how a person changes in different situations - each of the heroes is sometimes a wolf, who, due to his inheritance and his own goodness, saples the surroundings, sometimes a sheep, which is broken by someone else.
On both of these dates, in the Small Hall, the exhibition of the Liepaja Theatre Director Herbert Laukšteina "The Man who will wander from the lift" will be played at the Director of the Liepaja Theatre, in the name of Galina Poliščuka.
It is not a sad story, but a humourful story about how a single friend of one person becomes a lift.
Despite the stylistism of the grave, which prevails in the visual image of the performance, the dominant intonation of the inspiration is, however, light and even optimistic.
"The man who goes away from the lift" is not about loneliness and age, but about the worth of love for life.
Even if it seems that there is no one about what, the critic Līga Ulberte wrote about the show.
Tickets to all institutions can be purchased at "Bill Paradise" tickets and on the Internet.
Detection Olga: My work is not serial, but real life.
Olga Zelika, the owner and investigator of the Riga Detection Agency, is already on my halfway.
She laughs loudly and leaves a very positive human impression.
Beautiful in white bikes and white jacket - a very elegant woman who turns around all my impressions about what a woman-detector must be.
She's waiting for me with a champagne, from which I'm kindly refusing.
I told her that I was talking to her because I thought it was interesting that a woman was dealing with such an unusual thing.
This has always been done by men.
Olga has higher legal education - Master's degree.
He worked in criminal police.
Understanded that he wants something and founded his own company.
Knowing it is a little bit.
"In politics I really didn't want to come back," Olga says.
It's a rutin.
There, in the criminal police, we investigated things, gathered information.
We're working with suspects.
"This year we celebrate the ten-year anniversary of Riga Detection Agency".
She invites to the anniversary celebrations: "There will be no drinking."
All are solous people.
Asking about her business, Olga says: "Business is very specific."
I had a team for the first five years.
Then I realized that working in the team is sometimes dangerous.
It's a business, where if someone does not work professionally, he can get into a very bad situation.
If journalists have the fifth power, then we are the second.
Sphere is, of course, not simple.
Many are trying to squeeze us because we are dealing with the fraud of our spouses.
Let people think so!
Many come and require whether can impose hearing equipment, attract dogs.
Many have seen films.
Detective business is serious.
"It's a collection of information," Olga says.
If a crime occurs under law, I must warn against it.
We cook green tea and laugh to have at least a cup to hold and talk.
I have had a client whose husband was continually siting.
She was looking for protection, of course.
We also have protection.
Her husband was a mania.
At the beginning, everything is always beautiful and good, but then starts.
"It's the most horrible," Olga says.
Psych is broken, and it happens that you can be treated as an animal.
This can end badly.
Don't give God with suicide.
This is very dangerous.
People become victims at a moment.
"Much women are trying to leave their families and then return," she says.
I refused my last order.
"It happened for the first time in my life," reveals Olga.
There was such a strange situation.
She was married, she had a son.
"He husband hit her son and made her disabled," Olga remembers.
I believe that a woman has a mother's instinct and, firstly, it is necessary to protect her children.
When it happened, she came to me with a request to get out of that man.
There are people who are sat with reproach.
The most horrible thing is that the mother took the eye on it.
I can't understand that.
Her child is now a disabled man.
We once couldn’t find a body, and the dog helped greatly.
In the drug section, no dogs can happen at all.
"I understand that there are adequate people and those who do not have a healthy psyche," she says.
Of course, the facts of fraud are topical.
Or family divorce is taking place and information needs to be collected.
It shall be ascertained which party is to blame.
The last thing I have had on the subject when the girls have embarrassed other girls.
It's interesting, because men ever woke up, now women.
Even the best friends fight!
Women put 100 and more thousand euros into their friends.
Women should be careful when travelling abroad because they can be sold in slavery.
"Latvian women are intelligent and too trusted," Olga believes.
There have been cases where couples go abroad to marry a second time.
This is not lawful.
Olga says she had a husband like Jesus Christ.
Long height, long hair.
When I was 22, there was a tragedy.
He had severe head injury.
He returned as a completely different man.
"I pulled her out," Olga remembers.
It can be compared with hell, it was terrible.
Asking what the most unusual thing we have had to face, Olga says: "All are special, but it's the most exciting thing that uses trust."
When the girl's throwing the girlfriend.
Be borrowed and don't give money.
If you have a lawyer's education and experience in the police, you can work as detective.
"One thing is to feel like a detective, the other is to be," Olga says.
The situations in which we are dealing with untrust are very crazy, because women are often not ready to solve the situation.
They are not ready to accept the result.
This is an unpredictable situation because a person is not ready to lose his family.
Not every woman is ready to accept the reality.
Often young girls who feel the taste of money use rich married men.
One man who traced her wife said that she could not have the favorite because all her wives were fraudulent.
"He was married three times," Olga remembers.
At that time, there is a man’s problem when all the wives cheat him.
Olga tells us about the case of a woman with all the children who left her husband, and she asked him whether he had ever raised his hand against him.
In general, I'm constantly hit him, he answered.
In such cases, I refuse to work.
It seems interesting to me how things are resolved - whether photos are taken and shown to the spouse if there is evidence of fraud.
How is this happening?
"Paralel for detective work exists for the protection of personal data," Olga says.
This is a provocative question.
One law allows you to do everything, the other - let nothing.
For personal interests, we can take such photos and videos, but not for public viewing.
If a material which does not comply with the law is submitted to the court, there may be major problems.
In order to become detective, lack of education and experience, it is also necessary to be mentally healthy and to meet the criteria.
We don't take fingerprints, we're dealing with it with the police.
I say to customers - turn off the serials, here's real life!
In fact, when I worked in the (police) system, I also had to use dogs, they helped greatly.
"Narcotics in the section of no dogs at all can't happen," Olga says.
Some customers turn to me in connection with the investigation of murder, but I don't like to take such things.
These are very difficult things.
Now there are more and more clients of men, because women are often jealous about men.
It was once different.
Now women entertain, but men sit at home with children.
"Of course, the most decent people suffer," Olga.
I like Deal Carnegie.
He says, stop worries and start real life.
We all know that if you sit in one cheek, you have to turn the other, but you can't!
You have to say that you're unpleasant.
It must not be done.
No fear of losing what hampers life!
You must not become a little-hit, and we have what we are allowing to do with ourselves.
Yes, my first thing was directly related to a man’s distrust when a woman was not prepared to accept the fact that the husband cheated him.
She called all the time and asked her what to do.
"I'm now asking all the customers whether they are ready to accept the situation when they learn that a man really cheats him," Olga says.
It's not entertainment, it's life.
If you come and pay the detective, you have to take responsibility.
It's not a theater, a show, but a real life.
I also need a specialist.
It is a heart case and associated with Japanese medicine - treatment with hands.
This is a very interesting thing.
Why have I started to do that?
It is associated with a large amount of adrenalin, and you need to calm down yourself.
Require not only calm, but restores energy, light.
"People get out of my office positive and satisfied," Olga says.
She has signs of need at the wall office, and Olga tells her that they are written not by ot, but by fingers.
I didn't just get it until that time, the book of the need for me literally fell into my hands.
I felt it as a sign.
However, it is very personal.
Learn more about what you need here.
Olga is also singing.
It's her pleasure.
We're all creativity.
From 11 years on, I played a guitar.
I've written songs and clips.
I'm positive and smile, but I have to rest to recover.
Others are saved by alcohol, me, you need it.
Alcohol digestes.
In the police, it is much used because the work is full of stress.
"It causes aggression, and moves may be unpredictable", she says.
I'm interested in sport and needs.
For 15 years, I was working with tennis.
I also liked a ride with horses.
I shut down in nature, articles, I would like to write a book.
Detective work has a fine limit when the job enters your life.
"It's a job that shouldn't be put into life," she says.
The question is how you can combine your work with your private life, Olga says: "My beloved person is located in Italy."
We have very strong feelings.
That is the most true love in my life.
I'm enough to think about him, and I'm already feeling better.
Detectives usually do not trust, but he has accepted my work.
In fact, I separate work from private life.
I've not been in this business like that.
I've been directed once.
When I was a child, I saw more than others.
Thanks to the needs, the intuition opens.
There are a lot of detectives, but actually working - little.
In any case, it is work with the brain, and it is difficult to turn off.
You also need a rest.
"Other way you can't restart," Olga admits.
The most serious case I have worked with is the story of the Constanci.
I worked for a year with that thing.
The man literally laughed about that woman.
I did so that the child and Mom, however, went to England - farther away from the dangers.
There was no other option.
We must not regret ourselves.
We're looking for compassion.
It must not be done.
We have to rejoice for every day we have.
Thank God.
Every day three good things have to be told to someone else.
A good job or a day for yourself must be done.
We can't do that with men.
It's a big mistake.
We must know that we have a man, not a child, and we need him to take care of us.
If it's not good, you have to turn and go away.
You can go to church, I have it very much helped.
You don't have to be a fanate, but do what likes and helps.
Nothing will change if no change is made, there is a need to go away and change your life.
In no case should you put yourself and your children at risk.
You don't have to sit down and wait for something.
People are created to do good and to support each other.
If God has created us, we are already in need and we are not in vain in this world.
Never sit on the ground!
How best to prepare for a family photo session.
The summer continues to run in full spa, as well as the current school year, which families often take in photos.
For everyone to look happily and beautiful in the pictures, it is worth considering how to prepare for the photo session beforehand.
The tips "Ihappymama" provide a multichild mom Alexander Nesterenko and a professional photographer Marina Levickaja.
It should be photographed in nature, because it is much more natural and harmonious.
The study makes it much harder for children to feel and relax.
It is recommended to choose a uniform dressing style for the whole family, preferably in one color gamma.
For example, Alexander says that she chooses clothing for all six family members so that the clothes are not more than three colors in shades and as little as possible on clothes.
Don't forget for a good mood.
Imagine, joke, play, but in no case cry and not psych if children are not as obedient as they would like.
And here, the future tips are already sounded from a professional photographer crowd of charge!
You need to understand what exactly you want to embark on during the photo session and tell the photographer about it.
For some, they will be beautiful children and a perfect family picture, for others: "Life is the same as it is", that is, in the desire to see true, true emotions, or, as loved by the photographer himself, "refugeing back", "closed eyes", "influencing the nose".
Of course, someone also wants to "two in one", but this happens rarely.
In any case, when you go to the photosession, you have to understand that they are just a couple of hours from your life, and the less you will be stuck, the better.
You're yourself, there's no strong mother who works, prepares to eat, grows, and it's still, and no Daddy, who keeps talking on the phone.
And not the man who lives behind some unknown shell in you.
Be a family, remember how great it is to hang each other, smile yourselves, and laugh.
And then already the task of the photographer will just capture the real moments of the emotions that prevail between you.
If you have chosen a photographer, trust him.
It stops asking for 250 times to show who has come up, listen to his advice in the selection of clothes, the place for better frames.
Tap and glue all the clothes you need before, so that the day of the photosession no longer operates.
Plan the route and consider how much time you will need to get to the place of the photo session (especially when photographing takes place in the studio and time is limited).
If you have little children, then choose a photo session of the time that corresponds to the day of the week so that it doesn't happen at the time when the baby usually sleeps on the day.
And, of course, do not forget to take your children food, biscuits, water and favorite toys (methods and sweets are only used in extreme situations).
Prepare Dad that he may need to wear socks, but it is not usually written in such advice, and only photographers know what it is, Marina admits.
Do not drink a lot of water before the photosession and fall well before.
And it would still be advisable to organize a lot of entertainment together after a photo session.
Go to the park of attractions, eat some ice cream, wander with balls - which are more pleasing to the family.
At the same time, you will have great pictures and pleasant memories about the day you spend together.
Krasnopjorov and Fadejeva: raising the minimum wage - a miracle or a brake for the economy?
The issue of raising minimum wages in the public debate has almost or almost the status of the saint cow: either the promotion should be supported or some unexpressive, general phrases should be mentioned.
In view of the significant increase in the risk of economic stagnation (when we had avoided technical recession), we believe it is important to stress that raising minimum wages is not a miracle that will reduce income inequalities with one house, bring Latvia's salaries closer to Western European level and fill the state budget.
On the contrary, if the minimum wage is too high, it is more detrimental than the benefit, because it reduces the competitiveness and employment of businesses, especially in low-income sectors and regions.
In the first moment, despite a number of increases in wages during the post-crisis period, it seems that the minimum wage in Latvia is not so high as to significantly weaken the competitiveness of businesses in the usual few tens of euros per year - only EUR 370, while in some European Union (EU) countries the minimum wage is around half a thousand.
However, a different picture can be seen when compared with the average wage in the country (%) - the minimum wage in Latvia (44%) exceeds the EU average.
Since the proportion of minimum wage recipients in Latvia is significantly higher than in neighbouring countries (Latvia - 17%, Lithuania - 11%, Estonia - 6%[1]), a similar increase in minimum wage is binding for most companies.
According to the results of the survey of Latvijas Bankas companies, each fifth Latvian company responded that, as the minimum wage increased at the beginning of 2014, it was important or very important to increase product prices.
This means that, firstly, the increase in minimum wages was partly financed by consumers (i.e. the Latvian population); secondly, the increase in prices for several companies meant a loss of competitiveness in both the domestic and foreign markets (i.e. increased imports and limited exports).
Due to weaker competitiveness and weak production, it was important for almost every fifteen Latvian company to dismiss employees (which means greater unemployment and emigration).
In addition, almost every eleven company replied that, as a result of the increase in minimum wages, it was important for him to limit the recruitment of new workers.
It is worth remembering that in 2011-2013 the minimum wage in Latvia did not change.
Therefore, even if, in assessing the 2014 increase in minimum wages, each fifth company noted as important improvements in productivity, this does not mean that a similar result could also be expected in 2017 (the fourth increase in minimum wage could be exhausted by the capacity to raise productivity).
Another important result is that, because of the increase in minimum wages, it was also important for several companies to increase the remuneration of employees who earn more than the minimum wage.
Thus, the impact of the minimum wage was significant even for those companies where none of the employees received the minimum wage.
In recent years, the increase in minimum wages in all three Baltic countries exceeded the increase in nominal productivity (real productivity + inflation).
Thus, the further increase in labour productivity will have a negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses, notwithstanding the overall relatively low level of wages.
The analysis of the average economic indicators is not enough to assess the merits of raising minimum wages.
It should also be examined whether raising the minimum wage is "tolerable" in sectors and regions where the minimum wage is most commonly used.
The results of the Latvian Bank survey show that the highest concentration of employees with minimum wages is in small enterprises (the number of employees ranges from 10 to 19 employees; 25%).
At the end of 2013, the share of employees in industry and services with minimum wages was higher (16% and 19% respectively) than in trade (15%), construction (11%) and financial and insurance (2%).
On the other hand, Latgale, with a minimum wage of 64 % of the average wage (and more than two thirds of the average wage in the private sector), can rather be detrimental to its further increase by reducing labour demand (i.e. maintaining already high unemployment) and promoting the sustainability of the shadow economy.
Some signs suggest that the increase in minimum wages implemented in 2014-2015 (in total 27%) has slowed Latgale's development.
For example, Latgale is the only region in Latvia, where unemployment was higher in 2015 than in 2013.
It should be noted that Estonia and Lithuania do not have any region that would be so lagging behind in terms of average wages from the rest of the country.
For example, in Estonia, the average wage in all regions is at least twice the national minimum wage.
In Lithuania, the lowest wages are in the Tauragie region, but there was also a minimum wage of 54% of the average wage in 2015 (after two rapid increases in the minimum wage could reach 58% in 2016).
In the public debate, the call to raise the minimum wage to 68% of the average wage in the country (see, for example, here) has been repeatedly put forward, and this cannot be implemented in the short and long term.
Firstly, there is no such high figure from the average wage or even so close to it in any EU country.
Secondly, this would mean raising the minimum wage above the average wage in several sectors of the economy (which would mean bankruptcy and mass redundancies of companies in these sectors), such as the production of clothing, leather products, processing of fish, catering services and veterinary services; moreover, it is more than the current average wage in the private sector in Latgale.
The increase of minimum salary from January 2017 to EUR 400-410 per month, as currently proposed by the Ministry of Welfare, would make the minimum salary in Latvia (% of the average salary) one of the highest in the EU.
If nominal productivity increases by 4%, but minimum wages are at least twice faster, it has a clear negative impact on the competitiveness and employment of businesses.
Such negative effects will be most common in sectors and regions where the current minimum wage level has already been frequently used, for example in Latgale.
The fact that a significant increase in minimum wages cannot be afforded at the moment means that other mechanisms should be used to support low wage recipients.
Immediate effect can be achieved by traveling with a minimum non-taxable income tax (in budgetary limits).
Insufficient education, inadequate education and poor quality of education, as well as unsatisfactory health status (which often arises from the cost of medical services and long lines) is referred to among the real causes of income inequalities.
During the survey, 521 Latvian company responses were obtained to the increase in minimum wages that took place in January 2014.
The survey took place in the framework of the Wage Dynamics Network (WDN) project of the European System of Central Banks.
These figures represent companies with a number of employees of at least 10.
This also explains the low proportion of employees with minimum wages in construction.
11 fires were registered in Latvia on the day of the day, as evidenced by the operational information of the State Fire and Rescue Service (VUGD).
The biggest fires of the Latvians were in Ogres municipality in Ogresgala, where the 80 square meters in the area burned a single floor unmanaged residential house and the railways on the street of Jēkabpils, where an open flame burned a cleave filled with plywood of 30 square meters.
On Thursday, firefighters also went to calls where wastes, tyres, two light cars, walls and ceilings of the building, chips, house roof and fire food were left without surveillance.
During the day, the service also participated in 21 rescue work.
Death, victims or saved people are not reported.
Overall, during the day spent, VUGD responded to 38 calls, six of which were misleading.

Legendary Editor Hafington leaves The Huffington Post.
Arianna Hafingtone, the founder of the influential US media holding "The Huffington Post" and the main editor, has announced the departure from the company after 11 years of work.
The The Huffington Post, created in 2005 and awarded with the Pulicer Prize, which offers both a serious policy and economic journalism every day and provides for the reflection of the sensations of the Internet in entertainment, is considered to be a mass media development break at the time of the rapid development of digital technology solutions.
Medius, already starting in 2005, offered innovative and interactive content solutions for his time in conditions where he did not exist, but feisbuks gained popularity only among students in national colleges.
Shortly after the re-election of a representative of the Republican Party, George Bush, the President of the United States, Hafington, did not conceal the fact that media journalists represented liberal values, and with such a world view, the news materials were also prepared.
Now Hafington has discovered on the twitter that after the departure she is going to start a new business - she plans to create a startup "Thrive Global" to address the health and congestion of workers.
It is not yet known who could take her place under the Huffington Post.
During her life, the portal refused the anonymous comments, stressing tone that freedom of expression is given to people who stand for what they say and who do not hide behind the anonymousness.
She also decided in summer 2015 to publish information about the US Presidential candidate Donald Trampu in the entertainment news section.
It is true that, at the end of 2015, the information on the oodose candidate was again published in the policy section, pointing out that Trampa’s rhetoric is dangerous to the US society.
It is reported that in 2011, the US Internet Media Group AOL decided to purchase the fast-growing news site The Huffington Post, which was visited by almost 25 million readers every month at the time of the transaction.
The transaction amounted to $315 million.
In 2015, the Telecommunications Giant Verizon purchased AOL for USD 4.4 billion.
Verizon also bought Yahoo's business parts in 2016.
With these transactions "The Huffington Post", influential and independent media, became a small particle of the giant corporation.
The media content of the famous brand is currently available in nine international versions, with a unique monthly number of visits of 81 million.

In the south of Thailand, two explosions took place in the province of Surathon on Friday, about eight hours after the local time.
One explosive exploded in a flower pod in front of a marine police building, killing a municipal employee and injuring a man, announced by the Governor of the Province of Surathoni Vongsiri Promchana.
"I think it is related to explosions in Huahine," the Governor said.
A second explosion took place before the province police station.

Police officers save the baby from overheating in the car; parents are threatened with judicial work.
In Riga yesterday, municipal police officers rescued infants from a hot car, while the parents of the child threatened with judicial work on the existed car glass, the LETA informed the agency in the Riga Municipal Police (RPP).
Yesterday, there was a disturbed man on the patrol, who said that the shopping center Spice had noticed a car in the park, where a half an hour was a baby.
When you arrived at the event, you were looking for a car that was parked in the sun by the eyewitness.
The front passenger seat was a child seat in which the baby was located.
The child shined directly on the sunlight.
The infant was loud, intensely breathed, and his face was red and shed.
In view of the fact that the owner of the vehicle did not appear on the spot, the decision was taken immediately to disembark the rear glass of the car in order not to endanger the health and life of the infant.
The child with the whole seat is extinguished from the corrosion vehicle, and the guests are called.
The child breathed in a sequential, skin was red and hot, so until medical arrival, the order guards put a cool compress on the pier.
At the event, doctors and parents arrived almost at the same time.
The child’s father stayed aggressive while seeing the window of his vehicle.
Parents’ discussions and explanation that children under the age of seven are banned from leaving one without supervision.
In addition, the child was left under health and life - threatening conditions.
After the discussion, the doctors examined the victim and found that hospitalisation was not necessary.
On the other hand, the parents categorically refused to provide any explanations about what had happened and threatened with judicial work on the harnessed glass of the car.
During the negotiations with parents, there was nothing to show that they would be drinking or otherwise harming the child, so the infant of four months old was given both care.
Cases were sent to the Children’s Vulnerability Prevention Department, whose staff will assess the responsibility of parents.
RPP recalls that even if there is no very heat out there, a sunset car is heated very quickly.
If a child or pet is left in such a car, it may endanger their lives.
The members of the LPF could be required to suspend the Pon.
The members of the Latvian Fleet Federation (LPF) could in the near future ask from the position of the Chairman of the Federation to cancel its current leader Kasparu Poni, the former vice-president of the Federation Jānis Dzenis told the agency LETA.
He said that, in the light of the criticisms expressed in recent days on Pone and his activities in the Federation, several members of the LPF have signed a letter requesting the convening of the LPF general meeting, which is the highest federation institution, and have the power to decide on any issue raised at the LPF general meeting.
The members of the Federation are not satisfied with the master's management style, and his visit to the Olympic Games of Rio de Jajaneiro, which in turn did not have the opportunity to go to the Latvian record in Olympics by the swimming coach of Alan Ribakov, German Jakubovskis, is regarded as an unethical and unworthy act of the President.
He said that the members of the LPF, as well as the Secretary-General of the Federation, Aivars Platonovs, have done a great deal of work for the development of the federation and sports, but Mr. Involvement to the Federation is not very welcome.
The Dzine who worked in the Federation for a long time explained that there was an attempt in the Federation to concentrate power in the hands of one person.
Consequently, members of the Federation could also be required to amend the statutes governing the operation of the LPF, which would exclude this possibility in the future.
He explained that the dissatisfaction with Mr. work in the Federation existed for a long time, but the events of the last days have served as members of the "latest castle" federation to decide that action should be taken.
The former Vice-President of the Federation said that during the period of Mr. Mr., the work of the Coach and the Board of Judges was very reduced.
He explained that, in order to ensure a faster process and decision-making in the Federation, the members of the LPF had decided at a general meeting to authorise the board, composed of Mr and two vice-presidents, to lead the Federation.
However, as Dzenis acknowledged, Mr. deceived members of the Federation.
The members of the Federation trusted Mr, considering that it would be possible for the Federation to take decisions more quickly.
"He deceived the trust of the members because in practice he took power in his hands by making an ethical step," said Dzenis.
"This attitude cannot be from a person who should serve as an example for other sports representatives", acknowledged Dzenis.
In his view, Mr. President tried to meet his ambitions, which in turn did not honor him as the President of the LPF.
The long-term Secretary-General of the LPF Vladimir Maslovskis told the LETA that the letter could be submitted to the Federation next week, so the LPF general meeting should meet within a month.
In his view, the general meeting has to "consult all the troubled questions" and decide on further action.
Mr. Friday, it was not yet known that the members of the LPF were planning to convene a meeting in which they could decide to dismiss him.
I don't know anything about convening such a meeting yet, so I don't have any comments.
As regards the dissatisfaction of the members with my work, there has been only one case so far, with the coach named Jacukovski, when some dissatisfaction has been expressed.
Before the London Olympic Games, when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Federation of Water Sports (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any sportsman.
"After this case Jakubovskis lost the position of the senior senior coach, because his actions did not match the interests of the LPF," said Mr.
He also emphasised that the LPF members' general meetings, which accounted for their progress, had not received any reproach until now.
"On the contrary, we have received recognition that the quality of the federation's work has improved," said the President of the LPF.
Mr President also explained that the Olympics of Rio de Janeiro did not go to entertainment but work.
More people in Latvia are unclear and they do not understand the roles of federal presidents.
People do not understand that we are volunteers in these posts, and, for example, unlike the leaders of the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK), we do not receive salaries.
At the same time, we must make sure that the sports federation has sufficient funding, because only 10% of the amount required is received from the country's LPF.
During the Olympic Games, I have had formal and informal meetings with representatives of the international federation and various international programmes, including international sponsors.
"And the negotiations have been introduced and I worked for one of the World Cup stages to be held in Riga in 2018," Mr.
According to data from the Firmas.lv portal, in 2015 the revenues of the LPF totalled EUR 249 444, which is about EUR 36 000 more than in 2014.
Approximately 40% of this amount was made up of the target grants received last year, the amount of which increased by around EUR 10 000 compared to 2014.
In the form of members, accession and other annual contributions, the LPF also received around 43% of its revenues, or 109 442 euros.
In the form of Flowers and donations, the Federation received another EUR 35 532 last year.
Last year, the federation’s expenditure increased by around EUR 70 000 compared to 2014, with a total of EUR 263 876 spent in 2015.
The biggest expenditure was not related to payments of money to persons or to material expenses or salaries - EUR 215 733 in the report is mentioned as "other expenses".
In cash payments to persons, EUR 20 549 was spent and EUR 14 684 was paid in salaries.
If the 2014 Federation had concluded with a positive balance sheet, then the year 2015 LPF closed with a negative balance sheet.
As reported, the Ministry of Education and Science (IZM) requested an explanation to the Latvian Olympic Committee (LOK) about the participation of the President of the LPF in the Olympic Games of Rio de Jananeiro, which in turn did not go from Ribakov Coach Jakubovskis.
Latvian nationals have not suffered the explosions that occurred in Thailand, as shown by the entry on the social website Twitter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (JAV).
According to the information available to the Latvian Honorary Consul in Thailand, Latvian nationals have not suffered explosion.
LETA has already stated that it calls on travellers to regularly follow up information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to make sure the security of the place of stay, indicating that there is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Latvia invites people to avoid gathering places, to be particularly careful and cautious when staying in public places, and to follow the instructions of local authorities.
The Ministry invites travellers located in the resorts of Thailand or intending to go there to contact tour operators or airlines, specifying whether the journey will be carried out in accordance with the planned course.
The Ministry also invites travellers to regularly follow up information on the development of the political and security situation in the country, as well as to verify the security of the place of stay.
There is a high threat of terrorism in the country.
Given the unstable security situation in the country, it is not recommended that the AU go to the border between Thailand and Cambodia, as well as to the provinces at the border between Thailand and Malaysia - Pathan, Jala, Narathivate and Sonkhla.
In the event of an emergency, the Ministry invites you to contact the consular poster immediately by phone +371 26 33 77 11 or by e-mail palidziba@mfa.gov.lv.
The EAA also strongly recommends that any traveling abroad acquire a life and health insurance policy before travelling, which also provides for repatriation in the event of illness or death, as well as for registration in the consular register.
The Messi will not leave Argentina's football selection.
The football superstar Lionel Mesi, after a short time of reflection, has decided to return to the Argentina National Unit, Friday announced the player himself.
In July, the selection of Argentina in the second year in a row failed the Copa America tournament final, recognising Chile’s superiority in a decisive macho.
Immediately after the loss, the Messi announced that he had completed his career in a national unit, but then he was reported to be able to return to the sample.
"I took serious consideration of the possibility of leaving the sample, but my love for Argentina and the sample is too great", announced the 29-year-old Messi.
The Spanish grand Barselon attacker in the Mesi national unit rows in total 112 has won 55 gates, which is the best indicator for all the time.
With the adult selection, the Messi has not been a major success, although Argentina has become a world vice-champion in 2014.
Mesi five times named the world's best footballist.
Chinese Dzenis and Gels double over the Rio 20 km stepping distance.
Chinese bidders Van Zene and Cai Gelin won a double victory in the 20 - kilometre of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on Friday.
The Olympic champion was crooned by Zene, who conducted the distance in 19 minutes and in four seconds, finishing for 12 seconds to hurry the Gel.
In turn, the bronze was won by the Australian promiser Dein Burd-Smith, who lost the Son for 23 seconds.
Cay Bonfim, a favorite of the householders, corrected Brazilian record, but he was short of five seconds to get to the honorary pjedestic.
A song in London four years ago won a bronze prize.
He likewise in the same distance two silver medals in the world championships.
Judo coach Baskin: Nikiforenko is not the real heavy weight.
Latvian Junist Coach Oleg Baskin honestly acknowledged that Arture in Nikiforenko Rio Olympics had little chance of overcoming the most severe Azerbaidian athlete Ušangi Kukauri.
In practice, there was no chance, only minimal if he had been caught on a method or a partery.
We had already predicted that this would be the case.
He prepared him correctly, also fighting correctly, but the opponent was stronger.
The opponent was well known because Nikiforenko had already fought against him twice and both Arthur lost.
He's harder, though.
Arthur is artificially thrown into the heaviest weight category to enter the Olympic team.
Since the weight category up to 100 kilograms had already been occupied, Arthur used the European quota for the heavy weight category.
Arthur, of a weight of 100 kilograms, fought against a jute of 140 kilograms, who has already won a couple of times in serious tournaments.
In the heavy weight category there is a very few accidental moments in general.
If there are various changes in light weight categories in years, then in the heavy - very rare.
To the question whether Nikiforenko would be better fighting one step in the lighter weight category in the future, Baskins responded in a confirmatory manner.
I think yes - Arthur would be better to fight in the category up to 100 kilograms.
It's his real weight category.
He's not the real heavy weight.
65% of the Hungarians want to stop Maduro, the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
Two of the three Hungarians want to postpone President Nicolas Maduro, but the question is whether they are ready to fight for it.
The day after the National Electoral Board announced that there was no time for the withdrawal of the vote this year, with which Chavismo will be at the power of the beautys until 2019, people on the streets of Karakasa continued their usual day as if nothing had happened.
"I didn't hear the news because I watched the Olympic Games and how Michael Felps got two more medals," said Rafael Deian, a 36-year-old office worker who rested on Wednesday in Altamira.
In early 2014, the Altamir area located in the east of Karakasa was an epidemic of sharp turmoil in which he protested against the Maduro regime.
However, now that the opposition has to put more pressure than ever to achieve the referendum this year, people are no longer showing such energy throughout the country.
"I want a referendum, but for security reasons I will not participate in the protests," said Dean.
Others, more informed, want to mobilise in the future, but they admit that the Venezuelaans are not so motivated.
Tibisey Lusen, Chairman of the Electoral Board, commented on the claim that the government is hindering the withdrawal process.
I will protest when the opposition calls for the protest, but I know that some of my friends are afraid," Roberto Reyes, (60), said Fox News Latino.
So, in addition to all the barriers raised by the government to delay the referendum, the opposition is now facing a new challenge: motivating people to go to the streets and protest.
Recently, the referendum initiative had broad support: people arrived in an unprecedented number of cups during the signature collection phase.
However, when it comes to protesting against government moves to block efforts, the number of people who arrived on myths is significantly lower.
"Some people focus on the development of food lines, while others are fearful after 2014 for arrests and deaths," said Cipriano Eredia, the opposing legislator.
After Lusena announced that until the next step of the referendum process - even more signatures across the country - will have to wait until October, those who are against the Socialist Government claim that President Maduro and his followers simply try to deprive the Hungarians of the courage to believe that this year the vote is practically impossible.
According to the Constitution, if the referendum were held in 2017, Maduro could be deferred from office, but he would be allowed to call the next President.
If he had been suspended today, he has a duty to proclaim general elections.
The U.S. Department of State addressed this issue in the Thursday afternoon notice, calling on the Venezuela authorities to guarantee compliance with the constitutional rights of the Venezuela.
"The remaining steps to implement the presidential annullation referendum must be made clear, specifically and immediately, thus contributing to a rapid and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties of the country," it was written.
Luis Salamanka, a political analyst, who was a member of the electoral board between 2006 and 2009, that changes are not expected so soon.
"I think this year there will be no referendum unless the social unrest and protests become even stronger," he said FNL.
He said that Lusena and the government violate the law, but they will achieve their goal if people do not understand loudly.
The opposition called for a broad manifestation in September. First of all, in Karakasa, to ask for speeding up the process so that withdrawal can take place this year.
We want people from all over the country to mobilise this day in the capital.
The government will feel pressure," said Eredia.
Salamanka, on the other hand, believes that this situation cannot be expected for so long.
"They should respond to the Lusen statement faster and stronger, as it practically kills the referendum," said FNL expert.
Congressman Eredia acknowledged that some opposition parties want to make manifestation happen faster, while other groups want more time to organise.
The opposition must now be cautious.
If people feel unsafe in this situation, there is a risk that the activity of the second signature collection campaign will be low," Salamanka said.
The referral process to activate it should receive support from twenty percent of the national voters, which are almost 4 million people.
Salamanka and other analysts are convinced that, even if the withdrawal takes place in 2017, Chavismo will be disgraced.
However, some people are not so optimistic.
Our party wants political changes today.
"If the government concludes the road to elections, we will have to explore other legal options," Eredia said FNL.
A.Puķīti, Director of LNSC, shall be suspended from office.
At the extraordinary meeting of the Grand Duchy Council on 12 August, the majority of Members supported the deletion of Ainara Puķīša, Director of the Grand Dukes Centre for Sports (LNSC), for the duration of the service inspection.
In the near future, it is intended to find out the conditions which a visitor of the sports hall has written to the municipality in his application.
In particular, during the visit to the trainees, the LNSC client was injured by the head.
The guilty is the Sports Centre of the Lielvārdes district.
In view of the seriousness of the situation and possible appeal of the client to the court, the Commission was set up by the order of Vice-President Vita Volonte of the Grand Speech Council.
Its task is to carry out a service inspection at the Sports Centre and to deliver an opinion by 16 August of this year.
The next Tuesday is planned to reconvene an extraordinary council meeting to decide on the follow-up.
It should be noted that during a particular accident, A.Puķītis was on leave.
The Director of the Sports Centre is a deputy director in the training work of Oksana Grimaļuka-Nazarova from Friday to the time of the service inspection.
Ogres senior sports is a celebration.
Today the Sports Festival of the Ogres Pensionary Society took place at the Sports Centre Stadium.
The Seniorius at the Stadium were welcomed by Sanita Tauriņa, organizer of sports development work at the Ogres District Sports Centre, which had prepared a special programme for sports festival participants.
This time the individual results will not be evaluated, but the participants will be divided into four teams.
"The sum of the contributions of each member will be as a result of the team", explains S.Tauriņa.
Participants will have to perform four tasks: basketball fasteners, construction of the Eifelis tower with memory game, florbola performance stafete, summer skiing.
In order to succeed in all four holiday program disciplines, participants had to carry out warming tasks - "Country circle", "Country dance", "Extension", as well as three stafetes - to be carried out with the horse, to fulfil the elements of frissia and badminton.
All the tasks were prepared in an attractive form, and the participants of the sports festival performed them with joy, smile and fun comments, with each other's support.
A special excitement was caused by summer skiing, which took place in the dresses prepared by the organizers.
Racing was followed with the volunteers of the Ogres District Sport Centre who led the tasks, recorded the results and did not prevent the advice.
There was also the Ogres symbol of Ciekurs, who inspired the participants of the Sports Festival.
Ogres seniors proved to be quite active, attractive and good sports.
Peter Zeps, representative of the Green Team, put the ball into the basketball basket eight times in a minute, but only one performance junction was left behind by his team member Jānis Staudžs.
Ogrē pensioners are active.
Excursions are always full of buses, and about 300 people arrive on the balls.
"Twice a week we meet at the Family Support Centre's premises where we can play the novus, table tennis, use the trainers", says Jānis Staudžs, Chairman of the Ogres Pensionary Society.
At the end of the sports festival, all participants received thanks for their participation in the Ogres District Sport Centre, but the greatest benefit is to move out in fresh air, good mood and spend time together.
Prime Minister No.19 West Bromwich Albion 2016/2017
Guardian journalists predict 14th position (Warning out: it is not only the Alana Smita forecast, but our journalists' advice in general)
Last season heading 14
Opportunities to win in the league (with Oddschecker) 1000-1
Until last week it looked like a new season, such as the old Bromwich Albion: 2016/2017 season will again fight for satisfaction or stagnation, depending on how "empty is glass" under the pragmatic direction of Tony Pulis.
However, Jeremy Pise sold 88% of his club's shares to Guochhuan Lai and Pulis, in archaetically safe hands, immediately made the bukmeikers a favorite in the unpleasant role of the first dismissed manager.
The situation has undeniably changed in Balack Country - and not only Hawthorns, but also some miles north-western Volverhampton, where the new Chinese owners, without spending time, refused Kenya Jaket services.
Puliss, however, confirmed that his work was not immediately endangered, and the businessman has also expressed his desire not to change the club culture.
"I don't want to change the club's beliefs or start unsustainable fun," he said, taking over the responsibilities.
I would like to be a good owner and invest in this club in the long term.
First of all, our aim is to ensure that we remain in Prime Minister and then be even further, I would like to see the club reinforced at the top of the division.
I think it is the best league in the world, and I want to take this club as far as possible.
These are the achievements of Pulis, and the first aspect should not be a challenge.
The next goal is to break up to the top of the table, but the new owner and the increasingly fragmented fan base will be important to hope for a fast breaking table up to realize that it is a very difficult task, taking into account the incredible work that has recently been invested in the middle of the next table.
To go beyond the 14th place of the last season to get up, it will certainly have to work more.
Only Aston Villa, located in the lower end of the table, took less gate, and it is worth reminding that in Christmas Albion on average made less than one crash on the gate in 90 minutes, the worst indicator of almost or divide.
They failed to get gates 13 out of 38 games, and put more than one gate in only nine games.
Of their 10 wins, no game could get more than one gate, and seven games ended with 1-0.
As was expected, a dozen of 34 gates in total were obtained from standard positions.
It is not surprising that Hawthorn's team had dissatisfaction, probably the most noticeable after shocking 0-0 undifferentiated with Vilnius at the end of January when the guest team looked better.
On the other hand, only six best teams had better indicators of protection - although no club has managed to include four semi-protections in the list.
These guards are often not sufficiently appreciated, especially Johnny Evans, to whom Arsenal wants to be, given their recent crisis in terms of the injured players.
The international team in Northern Ireland experienced a great start in the European Championship, and Albion will have to spend thoroughly to sell.
Ben Foster's gates are reliable, and they are well completed in the middle line.
Daren Flecher, largely like Evans, showed to a large extent that he was still able to play at a high level at the age of 32, and Klaudio Jakob is underestimated.
All sides are disturbed by the fact that the long and incredible story of the future of Saido Berahino is still unclear.
As a owner, the rates from Stoke and Crystal Palace were refused, but they still maintain peace and Mark Huggage is ready to wait.
After the last season, being close to liquidation, it is worth all the parties involved to act.
The attacker is undoubtedly talented, but, as Pull has already mentioned on several occasions, it has been seen for a long time that such a relationship does not work.
Albion insists that it is necessary to sign the change documents before allowing the former UK U-21 sample member to go, but their 15 million pounds of move with Diaphras Saho were broken down a few days before taking over, claiming that he left the medical check and agreed on everything, but he had a back injury that would mean he would have to spend the beginning of the season.
It puts great pressure on the Venezuela Salomon Rondon, who looked very hopeful in the last season, but he needs to improve his performance of nine gates, especially if Ricky Lambert continues to be so ineffective.
The decision to release Victor Anichebi and Stefan Sesegnon retrospectively also look strange.
The Pull is unfortunately famous throughout his career with his slow new players moving up and three webs - Johnathan Leko, Sam Fiedd and Tailer Roberts' appearance in the last game of the previous season with undissolved 1-1 with Liverpool, hardly will become a norm.
He will return to those who have already tried and tested, but Leko is worth keeping sight of it.
The 17-year-old attacking cousin participated in five games in the previous season, becoming the first player in Premierlli, who is also highly appreciated in the English youth football system.
Met Philips, with a 5,5 million contract with Queens Park Rangers, will be fast, but he is the only new player who took part in the first weekend of the competition.
It would not be unsafe to say if the end would be rather urgent.
"All," the Pull last month said Express and Star about what would be improved.
Each position you see.
We need to strengthen back-up players, middle-square players and players in front positions.
The objectives are, we know what we want.
They appear to be much more difficult than expected, mainly because of the uncertainty about the takeover processes.
The season could be determined by how they have started, with seven largely winning games before the complex competition with Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.
During that time, the pressure on Pulis will be reduced or inconsistent.
And who knows maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.
Tata Steel UK closer to the rescue transaction after the authorised change in pension support
The pension authorities behind Tata Steel UK said that the scheme could be restructured without the involvement of the pension protection fund (PPF), increasing the company’s prospects of concluding a rescue transaction.
The British steel pension scheme has a commitment of GBP 15 billion and, according to estimates, a deficit of at least GBP 700 million, creating serious obstacles to the conclusion of the rescue transaction between Tata Steel UK and Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales.
Tata Steel is increasingly convinced of ensuring the future of the British business, which employs 11 000 people, following negotiations with the Minister of Economy and the pension regulator.
The company plans to combine its European activities, including British business with ThyssenKrupp, German conglomerate.
However, the conclusion of the transaction depends on whether the British steel pension scheme will be restructured and the government will provide financial support.
Alan Johnson, an authorised pension president, said that this scheme could avoid the PPF if the benefits received by employees were modified.
Although this is well-financed in comparison with other schemes, with a deficit of up to GBP 300 million for individual measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp wants to control their commitments.
Johnston said that the authorised persons recognise that it "is not realistic" to the Joint Undertaking or to any buyer of Tata Steel Uk to assume responsibility for financing the current and future deficit.
The modification of the benefits deriving from the scheme was a more binding option than joining the PPF, he added where employees would have to accept more disadvantaged conditions.
The Tata Steel sources warn that it could still sell Port Talbot.
The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of steel castings since its negotiations on the future of its British business have been launched in March, and this has been applied as a shortlist in negotiations with the British Government.
Kušiks Čaterjē, Executive Director of Tata Steel Europe, said that the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "sustainable".
With regard to the culinary Tata Steel annual meeting in India, Čaterjē said that negotiations on the restructuring of pension schemes are moving forward, but he insisted that the scheme was well funded.
"We are talking to various stakeholders, including the British Government and other stakeholders, such as the Wales Government, etc.," said the Times of India.
It is believed that pensions have a certain impact on goods such as steel business, so we need to find a structural solution that does not hinder business progress.
The willingness of pensioners to cooperate in negotiations on the restructuring of the scheme will be supported by Tata Steel.
Potential changes to the scheme include shifting the annual inflation-based increase in benefits from the retail price index to the lowest index of consumer prices, as well as limiting future pension payments to the statutory minimum.
Johnston added: "The resident and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the Government and the pension regulator with evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits for an indefinite period of time and with a low level of risk outside the Pension Protection Fund.
Our investment strategy has meant that the funding position of the scheme has not been affected by the recent fall in the securities market in the same way as in other British pension schemes, and we are still convinced that the scheme is able to provide benefits at a self-sufficient level.
CBS commentor mixs Michael Felps and Raiens Lohti throughout the race
The Canadian broadcaster CBC commented on the Olympic Games on Thursday evening caused anger by mixing Michael Felps with his competitor Raiens Lohti.
Elliot Friedman both enjoyed the entire 200 meters of individual swimming, in which Felps won his 22th Olympic Gold medal.
When Felps crossed the line, Friedman held him to Lohti, Felps and the ancient competitors on the top of the world swimming pool.
Friedman said, "When he'll do it!"
Ryan Lohte will exaggerate Michael Felps in this game!
Felps could not even get to the honor of the pjedegal.
However, Felps won, but Lohte finished the fourth.
Immediately after Felps was at gold, silence took place in the CBS broadcast.
In a miraculous way, the Friedman immediately recognized his mistake.
I'm sorry, I'm mixing the tracks.
Felps with gold," he said.
The Canadian commentary, whose professionalism was widely appreciated after the mistake, once again recognised his mistake within hours of the event and apologized to the viewers on the twitter.
I'm sorry to everyone.
I'm surprised.
"No excuse," he wrote.
In the meantime, Felps exceeded the record of 2 168 years of age as the winner of the ever greater number of Olympic victories.
The previous record belonged to Leonide from Rhodes, who had won more Olympic titles in the ancient Olympic Games than anyone else.
Russian hackers attacked the computer of the former NATO Force Commander.
The Hakers have published the lists of General Philip Bridlov and data on the work of one of the Soros funds.
The same hackers who could have had an attack on the e-mails of the U.S. Democratic Party and had published their lists may also be accused of the new series of attacks, reports the Bloomberg agency.
According to its information, these cyber attackers have attacked the correspondence between the former NATO European Force Commander, Philip Bridlov, and the "Open Society" Institute, which is part of projects supported by the millionaire George Soros.
The attackers published the information obtained in the link DCLeaks.com.
The Bridlova correspondence and data on the activities of the "Open Society" Institute are inserted there.
It is reported that hackers had access to fund computers for about a year.
The news agency claims that it is about the same hackers who were attacking the computers of the U.S. Democratic Party and led by the Russian speculation.
The U.S. intelligence service has already warned the high officials of the Congress about a possible hacker attack on the Democratic Party a year ago.
The news agency "Reuters" states that it has information that the secretaries have told a number of politicians - the cyber attacks are coordinated by two Russian intelligence services or their controlled organisations.
But they could not pass this information on to the victims of cyber attacks because it was secret.
The scandal on the attacks on the computers of the Democratic Party started after the publication on the Internet of around 20 thousand emails written by the party's representatives during the US presidential election campaign.
The party's candidate, Ms Clinton, announced that this flow of letters was organized by Russian speculators.
Press Secretary of the Russian President Dmitri Peskov declared that Russia had nothing to do with cyber-terriists.

If the owners of the apartments are very hard and specifically talk about the technical condition in which the building is located, if there is such a possibility to receive support and order the buildings in all possible ways, it is quite easy not to use it.
One of the most important changes is that EU co-financing will be available from this year to any multi-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-four-five-four-four-four-five-five-four-four-five-four-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-f-f-f-f-five-five-five-five-five-five-f-f-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-five-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f-f
In the past, it could only be used by a series of apartment houses.
The most worrying house managers, both by organising meetings of apartment owners.
A major problem where this process is currently delaying is that 67% of apartment owners are required to agree.
"The previous programme needed 51%," says Toms Cīrulis, project manager of the SIA "Liepājas nams" (LNA).
"Observedly, it is very difficult to ensure this because the majority of the general meetings do not arrive in such a quantity of apartment owners", says Gints Ločmelis, project manager of "Namo servisas APSE".
The largest house managers in Liepāja - "Namu serviss APSE" and LNA, which serve around 900 buildings, are planning to renovate at least 50 apartment houses in the new programming period by 2020.
They do not exclude the possibility that it will be difficult to convince people to vote for the renovation work at the beginning of the work, but every project implemented should improve the attitude of the population.
I also had to get a bank credit, 76% of the home population.
"When explaining what's going to be - I still get them," says the oldest of the energy-efficient buildings in Latvia, Vita Issalniece.
She agrees with John, who also lives in a warmed building.
Well, you can't know that half's invented, and the other side's plus one person then disagrees.
"No, of course, it is important that everyone agrees with the whole measure," notes John.
Such a change is proposed by the representatives of the financial institution ALTUM.
They explain that with the number of 51% votes in banks, it is not possible to attract the necessary funding, which has also been the experience in the last programming period.
In most commercial banks, two thirds of the owners of apartments are required.
Anda Lagzdiņa, the Head of the European Union Fund Unit of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, as one of the recommendations for house managers, mentions the opportunity to present the citizens with the examples already available and the various benefits of renovating buildings, for example, energy saving.
In his youth, Aaron was a long - suffering world for the death of his mother.
A potential suicide explosion operation in Canada was worthy of the pressure film.
All started when the Canadian police received a video captured by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Very early in the morning, the Royal police in Canada received reliable information from the Federal Investigation Office.
It contained, among other things, the so-called "mixture" video recorded by an unknown person who clearly was at the final stage of the attack.
"And he was going to work with a self-made explosive," said the Deputy Chief of the Canadian Police, Mike Kabana.
In the video record, a man in English and Arabic, who was dressed in black mask, threatened the Canadians and promised to resist everything they had done to the Muslims.
Within about three hours, the Canadian police has managed to recognize this man by using face and voice recognition computer programs.
It was a 24 - year - old Aaron Driver.
He was already under the supervision of the probation service for praising the ideas of terrorism and radical Islam on the Internet.
By judgment, Driver was prohibited to do so in the future and to engage in any radical organisation.
However, until then, the authorities did not consider that Driver could pose a physical danger to the surroundings.
When the police arrived at his home in the city of Strattoi, Ontario, the young man had gone out and sat in the taximeter.
At that time, the order guards tried to arrest him, but the Driver had triggered the explosive when sitting on the rear seat.
To prevent the detonation of another explosive, the police shot a young man.
He's dead from injuries.
The taxi driver is not intact.
In an interview with Canadian television, Neutralized Terrorist father Wayne Draivers said that his son had focused on Islam in teenagers.
It initially helped him to cope with drugs and alcohol.
Aaron, however, was a problem a teenager who had long been annoyed on the world for his mother’s death, adds his father.
Just when I saw that video in the news today, I would know how far he was gone.
I didn't know he was so radical.
"I also didn't know that he was so well able to speak Arabic," says Aaron's father.
The Canadian police acknowledge that if they had arrived a few hours later, developments could have been much different.
Radēviča will travel to Rio as a tourist and will support Latvian fragrances.
The former Olympician and the light-leaved Ineta Radēviča LTV in the Olympic Study said that the Friday performance of seven fighters' athlete Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa in the first two disciplines is not bad, given that the athlete was injured.
In the high attack, Laura resurrected with the right leg, not as usual with the left.
Radēviča pointed out that it is comparable - just as a person who will be trapped to write with the right hand would suddenly be forced to write with the left.
Therefore, the result of Icauniece-Admidne is not bad due to injury.
Radēviča discovered that Ikauniece-Admidiņa has not yet contacted, but is actively following her starts and feeling with her.
Ineta recently learned about Laura’s injuries and expressed her support to the athlete, pointing out that the athlete did not start to create its own safety pills, but showed its nature and the spirit of the fighter.
With regard to other sports, Radēviča believes that the Olympic norms are very high, so one of the Latvian athletes is ashamed that he went to Rio as a tourist is incorrect.
She remembered that when she traveled to the first Olympic, where she won 13th place, she was called a tourist, and it creates negative emotions.
Ineta sometimes remembers its starts, not just the Olympics.
"I like to remember my emotions, not the results", remembering my experience in sport, discovered Radēviča.
She told me that it was always important that there would be a man in the tribes who would give me the energy of companionship.
Radēviča itself will, however, be a tourist this year - she will go to Rio de Janeiro for the next week to support Latvian athletes.
She points out that she will definitely go to light-sensitive competitions.
In 2010, Ineta Radēviča won the title of the European champion.
In 2004, at the Olympic Games in Athens, she took 13th place in distance and the 20th position in three-step attack, but in 2008, athletes did not start, because they had their son's expectations.
In London, as already mentioned, Radēvič had a 4th place in distance.
There will be a film "Quantum code" with a physicist in the main role of Kashcheyev.
The film's annotation says that, in parallel to the division of electrons in the laboratory, Kaščejev is a dreamer, a teacher, a socially active and civic husband and father who is looking for links with the Almighty.
The hero of the film in the Latvian TV broadcast "Rite Panorama" indicated that the reception of the film had an interesting experience.
I found out how the film is going, how it is filmed, how the sound is recorded.
"And in fact fantastic work," said the physicist.
He acknowledged that the film was two years old.
The biggest disagreement with the director was the title of the film.
I am categorically against this name.
No quantitative code exists.
"Not such a secret that the film could learn and is all clear," the associated professor of LU added.
Kaščejev recognized that he likes the fact that the premiere of the film will be experienced directly in the evening of Murjan's open-air cinema.
They are organized by friends from the Vigli Foundation, and these movie sessions will take place every evening until 9 September.
In Thailand four people died in tourist attractions in bomb explosions
After the Thai people voted in favour of the adoption of the Constitution supported by the military, a series of bomb explosions, which led to four deaths and many injuries, took place in the five southern provinces of Thailand - the popular destinations of tourism.
The first two explosions are ruined at the seaside resort in Huahine on Thursday evening, next - Friday morning.
The city is about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok.
The police declared that one Thai woman was killed in the first explosion and 20 people were injured, 10 of them were foreigners.
The authorities confirmed that other explosions collapse in the southern cities of Phouquet, Trana and Surathon.
Two balls were exploded in Phoucet in Paton and two more in the province of Phanna - in the tourism region north of Phoucet.
Over the last 24 hours, 11 bombs have been exploded in Thailand.
On Friday, Colonel of the Royal Police of Thailand, Chrisana Patanačaroen, declared that the explosion was not related to Islamic extremists and considered to be local acts of sabotage.
"It's too early to draw conclusions," he said.
"However, we certainly know that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact it is a local sabotage, and we are trying to find guilty persons."
On 12 August 2016, following a small-scale bomb explosion in Huahine, investigators collected evidence from the place of crime.
On 12 August, the officials announced that four people were killed in a number of bomb bombs in the important tourist areas of Thailand.
There are no conflicts in the country that could lead to terrorists in the country.
"However, we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.
No group has yet taken responsibility for the attack, and the competent authorities have not accused any special group, but the explosion took place in the same week as the Thai voters approved the new Constitution.
All three southern provinces - Huahina, Phoūket and Phanna - rejected the referendum supported by the military, and in the south-eastern provinces of Thailand, where the majority of the population are Muslims, more than 6500 people have died since 2004 in the wakes.
The explosions took place on the birthday of the Queen of Thailand Sirikita, which is a public holiday in Thailand.
Huahine is located in the royal castle Klai Kangwon, or "city far from anxiety", where the royal family of Thailand often resides.
King Bumibol Aduljadey was the longest ruler of the monarch in the world.
PAYMENT: In the province of Meggle, the grassland was stolen.
The social networks report that a dwarf seized heroes.
Let's help us find it!

Porgie and Bess, what we have long deserved!
There are infinite many operas that have never scanned in Latvia.
There's something that sounds very rare.
However, it seems strange if, since the 1970s, George Gērschwin opus Porgie and Besa have not been arranged or played, unless there is such a chrestomatic solo number as Summertime’s periodic adjournment to the scenes (including as a typical work at the Ineses Galantes summer festival), individual students’ projects, guests, etc.
There are reasons for this: since Latvia has been a civilised state in the Western world, it has binding rules and copyright licences for the family heirs of Gerschwin, which are valid for Porgia and Bess until 2030.
Harmonisation procedures are not simple.
In addition, when the author made a full insight, he wanted all fourteen steps to be black.
In Latvia, of course, there are little known discussions and contexts around this opera in the US in terms of racial terms, and the composer's desire to fulfil it would be difficult.
The concert of the compromising concert with the help of the four artistic black American soloists and their brothers and sisters in their Latvian offices on 6 August was brightly expressed at the 10th anniversary of the Cēsis Art Festival, reminding Gēršvina of the charming sounds of its European classical music traditions with American jazz rhythms, gospels, fashion dances and memories remaining in the beginning of the 20th century, telling Ketfishrov’s bouquet Poorgia and the aggressive taure Bessa love story in musical quality that deserves documentation of the history of music.
Firstly, because of LNSO and conductor Andra Poga.
Despite the complex spatial location of the concert performance in the casual nature park, the orchestra is on the side of the stage, on which the soloists and the corris (and great dance!) were working while, the total sound was stylisticly nuanced, rich and accurate in contrasts both in fixed and metal bladder instruments and in the piano party (Mārtiņš Zilberts).
Secondly, because of the excellent team of soloists.
Harrismic dramatic barriton Lester Linch (Porgius) is a loved singer in Europe and America, which is a repertoire of both bariton and basbariton parties, especially in Verdi's operas.
Porgia's role has been singing many times, several times also Kraunu - he felt like fish in the water and also inspired the partners of the stage even in concert to enlighten the emotional atmosphere of solidarity of the poor people of the fishermen village.
Letonija Mura discovered as a vital plastic combination of various vocal styles with dramatically toned themebrus and fantastic piano in its second performance of Porgia and Besa (the first took place in 2012, not less than with the Berlin Philharmonics and Sir Simon Retlu).
Not in vain, she is one of the most bright in modern Adams.
The attractive joyful tenor Jermein Smith, which Andris Poga was looking at in Boston's institution, has the image of the narcodler Sportslaif in four continents.
In it he demonstrates his synchronous dance and singing skills as a well trained musical actor.
Six is one of the rare cleaners, whose voice seems still to hide unopened vocal possibilities as 15 years ago when the opera's voice was accidentally found by caring it to smell peers.
It is unbelievable that even from the 24th row and relative darkness of Jermein Smith’s expressive gesture language allows you to see his arms winning dust bag even if it isn’t there.
How should poor Bess not follow such a mefistox temper that makes it empty to believe the illusion of a wonderful life in New York?
The bloody role was reflected in the theme generously enclosed Rodny Clark.
The largest German surprise in the team of Latvian soloists in Cēsis was the luxurious top register of Sirine, the luxurious balance between the spoken and the songed text, corresponding to changing the voice position, the performance of vocal acrobatics and dramatics of both the Syrian graceful My Man is Gone Now, and the stylised pre-heated ampoule in prayer Oh, Doctor Jesus.
Margarita Vilsone’s voice was well sounded in the role of Clara, but the iconic Summertime at the very beginning expressed a swing of a little loud and nervous, having its true character in the repic.
The Colorites and splendidly spoke of the parties assigned to Micahil Chuļpajev, Rihard Mačanovskim, Andrim Lapiņa (especially the Crab seller placed on the walls of the castle drum in response to the soprano's delicious Soman seller of Irma Pavāre).
Excellent characters in Ilon Bageles, Rihard Miller, Emīla Kivlenieks's pictures, as well as in the roles spoken, where the investigator of Ivo Martinsons and the director and actor Juris Žagars of the Cēsis festival, who was unfortunately presented to the viewers of the white lawyer Ārčdeil.
In the spatial concept of concert performance created by the messagera Kairiša, the corris acted on the steps - mainly in proscene, rarely entering or leaving the stairways.
A little comic situation was done in the hands of Latvian soloists in sufficient dynamic activity.
Their presence is, however, a rather prudent explanation.
First, some soloists sang several episodeal roles (which sometimes caused difficulties in tracking their stage for identity).
Secondly, there are many dialogues in Porgia and Bessa, in the talk of the excited phrases, replicas, which are easier to track with the notes.
The listeners were very helped by a titre machine to study the nuances of the opera scene in Cēsis.
The weather did not compell, and the first part of the concert work was quite long.
However, it did not prevent most of the listeners from staying to the end in order to grab artists.
Nine in the evening is a rather late starting time for a full-length opera, especially if a longer homeway is expected from Cēsis, but opera Porgie and Besa are worthy of returning to the musical circulation of Latvia and are likely to become one of the most bright musical adventures of this summer.
Also in Liepaja, where it sounded yesterday evening and in very other acoustic conditions.
In the playground of Riga, the man feared children with a curvature.
Yesterday, August 11, about eight evenings, the State Police received a message from a feared child’s grandmother who was worried about the presence of a man in Lomonosova street in a child’s field who fears children with a cirvi.
The guards immediately responded to the call and arrived at the event where the man was also encountered with a curve, which at the moment of the event was in a very large alcohol diode - 3.07 promiles.
It was found that the man born in 1962 had previously feared the children so that they could not noise.
But this time, intimidation of children, the aggressive man used a curvature that was used by the child’s field equipment.
The man was arrested.
In the context of the event, a criminal procedure has been initiated for disruption of rupeal public order, manifested in a manifest disrespect for society or in disregard, ignoring generally accepted standards of conduct and disturbing people's peace.
Such a crime shall be punished by a custodial sentence of up to two years, or by temporary custodial detention, or by forced work, or by a fine and with a probationary supervision of up to three years.
The presidents of the Federation generally use guest accreditation in the Olympic Games.
Presidents of sports federations usually arrive at the place of the Olympic Games for a few days and use guest accreditations that can change names, so they have several owners during the competitions, LETA told the representative of the Latvian Olympic Unit (LOV) Marita Vilciņa.
On Wednesday, a massive swimming-up was due to the expressions of Germana Jakubovska, the Olympic Swimming Coach of Alan Ribakov, who found that at the last time Rio de Janeiro Olympic has decided to go to Rio de Janeiro, the Head of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF) Kaspars Mr, while the coach has to stay at home.
Later it became known that Mr. Brazil had arrived with a coach accreditation, for which the President himself expressed a surprise because "there is nowhere in".
As said by Vilciņa, only the presidents of two federations – Mr. and Guntis Zalītis, Head of the Latvian Light Athletic Union (LVS) – lived in London's Olympic Games.
In the Olympic village there are athletes, as well as official persons, including, for example, coachs, doctors and delegation administrations.
As a result, Mr. John was probably also a coach accreditation in London.
"The other presidents of the Federations arrive as guests, and their accreditation is changing: they arrive for a few days and then someone else uses it," said Vilciņa, explaining that therefore the presidents of these federations do not live in the Olympic village.
Mr Rio de Janeiro arrived at the end of July and Brazil will be left on 13 August, which is why he is likely to be there for the longest time from the presidents of all the national federations.
Significantly, only one day - August 10 - started the Latvian deckboards in swimming.
Latvia will be represented in 11 sports games in Rio de Janeiro, and the LETA estimates show that six or seven presidents will travel on the four-year most important competitions.
The lawn in Brazil will arrive on Saturday, the President of the Latvian Rolling Federation (LRF) Igo Japiņš will be to the BMX competitions planned next week, the President of the Latvian Federation of Windserfinga Ansis Dāle to Rio de Janeiro plans to fly on August 16, when Ketija Birzule will be finished, and the President of the Latvian Federation of Fight Dzintars Urbanchiks - the day earlier.
The next week, too, the President of the Latvian Shooting Federation Karlis Krēsliņš has planned to arrive, when the starts of the shooter Dainim Upelnieks will have already finished.
Raimonds Rublovskis, President of the Latvian Judo Federation, did not appear at least during the Latvian athletes' competitions in Rio de Janeiro, although his arrival was planned, the Latvian Canoe Federation is not currently a president, but the Latvian Olympic Committee continues to confront the Latvian athletes in the important celebrating society.
Meanwhile, the President of the Latvian Volejball Federation Atis Sausnītis and the Head of the Latvian Tennis Union Juris Savickis decided not to arrive in Rio de Janeiro.
Vasilievs appreciates the natural breasts of Latvian women.
The world-famous Russian fashion historian, interior decorator, scenograph, book author, lecturer and collector Alexander Vasiļevs visited Latvia very often during the last years.
Recently, he appreciated the contestants at the final of "Mis and Mister Latvia 2016" and acknowledged that Latvia's artists, unlike Russian artistic sex representatives, can be proud of natural breasts and lips that have not been improved by the injection of silicone and botulinum.
Talking with "Vakar Ziņām" Alexander Vasiļev said that for many years there is already the president of the jury in the popular competition "Mis Russia".
That is why he also participated in the evaluation of "Mis and Misters Latvija 2016" participants with great interest.
In questioning the different standards of Latvian beauty competition from similar competitions in Russia, Vasiļjevs stressed that Latvians and cryots have quite different figures: "Russian beauty competitions have more breasts than Latvian competitions."
However, Latvian youths are beautifully dressed and frozen and can also be proud of natural beauty, not of the miracles performed by plastic surgery.
Therefore, I particularly congratulate the participants of the Latvian competition on their natural beauty.
Vasilyev has great plans in connection with his professional activity in Latvia.
The exhibition "Adapted Nature" of fashion historian collection is currently displayed in the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design.
In Ventspils, the palace of the Order of Livonia, the exhibition of Vasiļjeva "House Clothes 1860-2010" is displayed.
Vasilievs loved Ventspils so much that a few days he also enjoyed hospitality and walked along the sea.
I love it very much in Latvia.
In particular, now that there is a terrorist threat across Europe, there is a real corner of Paradise.
"In Latvia spend time and rest is a pure pleasure", recognized fashion guru.
In addition, on 23 November Alexander Vasiliev will open the private fashion museum in Old Riga.

We, the family of Rinalda, are grateful to fantastic people around and to God for having the opportunity to save Rinalda, but, unfortunately, it is not possible at present to fully cover the costs of medicine for our own forces.
Rinald Grinberg is a 11 - year - old tummy who was diagnosed with brain cancer at the end of July.
This year he graduated from class 4 in Milzkalne's primary school with excellence, strong athletes and a very talented artist.
It seems that everything gave him up.
A healthy, joyful, persevering, hard and active boy.
Always smiling and kind.
On July 26, we will be remembered in our family forever.
The last few weeks were mocated with nausea, headache, but doctors delayed it on the abdomen virus.
And at first it seemed like it was.
Because who could have imagined that such "innocent" symptoms at fault are something much more serious, which is inconclusive to mind.
We got a diagnosis on July 26 - Rinald has a brain tumor.
The fluid is rapidly stored in the brain, but everything that doctors can help in Latvia is to carry out a shunting operation to remove excess fluid, because the tumor is virtually not available for direct surgery.
It is also not possible to determine whether the tumor is benign or malignant.
The next plan paid by the State: to start radiation and to watch what is happening.
It seemed like such an evil nightmare, we'll experienty here, and we'll look at the results.
Fortunately, it was possible to show the results of the studies with Rinalda to the doctor in Spain.
He is Vice President of the World Association for Neurosurgery, one of the leading neurosurgeons in the world.
He took the operation, and he also showed that he had to operate immediately.
The tumour has a huge pressure on the brain, and the risk of complications is too high.
It is also urgent to understand whether the tumor is benign or malignant to develop a plan for further treatment.
Without thinking, parents chose to go to Spain to save their son.
At the fanastic speed, Rinald and his mother, Evi, were in Spain on August 8 and he was operating on August 9.
There was a very complicated, more than 6 hours of surgery.
The operation took place in "Santa Elena" clinic.
Successed to remove most of the tumours, reduce the pressure, obtain analytical samples.
Rinalds now travel from the bed and as a decent teenager demands potatoes in dinner fry.
Now there is a need to wait for the results of oncological analyses.
Thanks to the doctor Araez and the clinic management, who understood the situation and had an urgent operation without being paid full compensation for the treatment before surgery.
As they trusted that the remaining amount would be paid, only 10,000 euros were asked for the first contribution to operate and save Rinalda's lives.
The EUR 6 000 for parents was able to provide by selling the technology, but the rest of the necessary sums for travel expenses, living, the first contribution of the hospital managed to borrow from the relatives and friends.
But at least EUR 24 000 is needed to settle for the first stage of treatment in Spain and to repay the money that we have borrowed for the first contribution.
Please help us reimburse this, Rinalda health so important, operation.
Each euro is important to help cover the costs of the operation already carried out and to enable the treatment of Rinalda to continue successfully.
The signs of discomfort in Ukraine raise the question: What does Vladimir Putin think?
The truth of these claims has been gained.
Ukraine denies them, while the US and the European Union claim that Russia has not provided any evidence.
The Open Analysis Group, Digital Forensic Research Lab, has found some signs of Saturday fire, but very little to prevent the big plans of Moscow.
Russia is known for the distortion of events or misinterpretation for political purposes, in particular as a result of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.
This does not mean that all Russian claims are unfounded.
) (a.k.a.
The attempt to attack in Crimea is still a topical issue, although there is little reason for suspecting that the Ukrainian Government would sponsor the scenario of such events.
Whatever happens, the images found by the analysts of the open source show that Russia has increasingly increased its military presence since at least the last Saturday - before the expected attack.
They show how heavy arms convoys are moving through the peninsula, including shore-side missile systems.
Injuriously known Russian escalation
Separate reports show that the Russian forces in Crimea had already planned a rotation that could help explain the activity, although it would be a very large coincidence that it would simply happen in one of the most severe times of stress since the anexia in 2014.
Regardless of what was known at the end of the week, Mr Putina has undoubtedly focused even more on Ukraine in his statements, choosing to use this episode, whatever the reality is, for what bigger purpose.
Analytics point to worrying parallels with Russia's way of acting just before previous military operations against Ukraine.
In February 2014, with similar speeches and military manoeuvres, a cover was provided for the volunteers of the Crimean resistance forces to take on a peninsula that was still under Ukrainian control only to reveal that they were in fact Russian special units which started military occupation.
In August, when the separatists supported by Russia did not participate in Eastern Ukraine, Putin deployed forces along the border to warn that they could be necessary for the 'protection' of the Russian ethnic civilians in Ukraine, who, according to him, are attacked.
He arranged a convoy of assistance to a region that, according to NATO, was only the cover of the Russian invasion forces.
What is Mr Putina going to do in Krima?
Some mentioned whether Moscow alone is planning another military intervention.
The fights in Eastern Ukraine have exacerbated, as was before the invasion in August 2014.
But this seeming parallel could be the point when it is intended to introduce fears of military activities, not of actual actions - it will shortly give Putin both in relations with Ukraine and with Western countries.
Mark Galeoti, professor of the University of Nujorka, who studied Russia, pointed out that the Russians would be of little importance as a point from which to launch military activities against Eastern Ukraine bordering the Russian land rather than Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better protected.
"It is a very small chance if the Russians really plan some large-scale of the offense," said Mr Galeoti.
Rather, "we can see the classic Russian strategies in creating pressure."
The international peace negotiations on Ukraine, once a mechanism by which Putin forced contacts with Western leaders who ignored him because of the annexation of Crimea, are viewed as unsuccessful and insignificant.
When Putin promises that there is a threat that conflicts may come back, he gives new meaning to the negotiations: get him away from the edge of the indigenous.
"It is the standard Putin's tactic - he wants to try to start from the power position," Galeoti said about the next peace negotiations scheduled for the beginning of September.
"And the only strength is to say, "If I would like to, it could make everything much more, much worse."
Make an agreement with the West
Putin also said this week that during the tensions of Crimea it was not important to continue the negotiations, making other parties convincing him to return to the negotiating table and entering the centre of the process.
What does it actually give him?
Firstly, it allows Russia to continue to strengthen as the world's power, although its economies are smaller than Australian.
Second, it positions Moscow as having veto rights with regard to Ukraine's sovereignty by maintaining a certain extent the State under Russian control.
It can also be in favour of the long hopes of Putin for an extensive agreement with the United States to resolve their disputes on the issue of Ukraine and Syria, under favourable conditions in Moscow, naturally, also by terminating Western sanctions against Russia.
Putin's homes on this target have been expressed several times since the deterioration in the state's economic situation in 2014, mainly due to the decline in the value of national oil and gas exports.
Since his invasion in Syria last autumn, he has repeatedly called on the West Powers to join him in the great coalition to fight extremists.
However, the Russian leaders may consider that they would need to ensure such an agreement before January when the mandate of President Obama expires.
The Russian official essentially believes that the next President will be the Holy Clinton, which is more hostile to Moscow.
Donald Mr Tramps, although he is obviously friendly to Russia, is still considered unpredictable.
Obama, on the other hand, is regarded as "seeking solutions, not conflicts," said Galeot.
So it is worth closing the window to ensure that something is done quickly.
Meanwhile, if a wide-ranging agreement is not reached, it seems that Putin is satisfied with the preservation of the weak neighbour of Russia by mentioning what will be the next.
In the previous version of this article, the year when Russia erected Crym from Ukraine was wrongly indicated.
This took place in 2014 and not in 2013.
When the Congress arrives in the cave, the White House moves the means to fight against the Zick virus
The Obama administration said on Thursday that it would shift USD 81 million from biomedical research and anti-poverty and healthcare programmes to pay for the development of vaccine against Zika virus through emergency measures, as the Congress did not approve new funding for the eradication of the virus.
In a letter to the Congress participants, the Secretary of Health and Humanitarian Services of Silvia Metjūss Barvela, the National Health Institute and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority will remain free of money to fight the disease transmitted by the Ood until the end of the month.
Therefore, it would be necessary to discontinue the development of the vaccine at an important time, with the increase in the number of cases of Zick’s disease acquired in the country in Maiami.
In the United States, 7 350 cases of Zica virus have been reported last week, mostly in Puertoriko (according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention).
Ms Barvelas said that 15 infants were born with birth defects associated with Zick’s virus.
Virus can cause brain development abnormalities and other severe defects in motherborn children.
The spread of the disease in the continental United States, when the first cases were recorded at the end of last month, has increased the political rates for the reaction of the Federal Government.
The expiration Clinton campaign stopped in Vainwood, the vicinity of Maiami, where there was an outbreak of the number of Zic viruses transmissed locally, and put pressure on the Congress to return from its five-week break to confirm the emergency funding for the fight against the virus.
President Obama and the Republicans of Congress have been controversial in most of the cases of Zika virus in the year.
In February, Obama requested USD 1.9 billion for emergency funding.
The Republicans suspended it by requesting a more detailed report on which money will be used.
Legislators have been contesting for months about how much money should be allocated and how it should be spent.
In the last month, democracy blocked the examination of the measure proposed by the Republicans when it was allocated $1,1 billion to fight against the Zick virus, but included conditions that would prohibit the allocation of funds for family planning for contraception measures in relation to the virus that can be so transmissible on the sexual path.
This clash forced the White House in April to channel USD 589 million to the fight against the Ebola virus against the Zick virus. About two thirds of the funding is intended to be used within the country.
On Thursday, Mrs Barvelas said that her department had spent most of the money and that it would be spent in full by the end of August.
"The failure to decide on the emergency funding for the fight against Zick virus has led the administration to choose between delaying the important vaccine development work and catching up other valuable national programmes to prevent this delay on a temporary basis," Barvela wrote.
The Democrats took note of this communication in order to transfer additional money to the Republicans for the fight against Zick virus.
At the news conference, Nensija Pelosi from California, the leader of the minority, invited the representative Pol D.Raiena, the Spikler of the Chamber of Representatives, to remind the Congress of the further direction of this event.
"All opportunities have been exhausted, and we are now focusing on the National Health Institute," said Mrs Pelosi.
The advisers of Mr Raiena say that the diversion of funds is a step that had to be done long ago and which the Obama administration has deterred from extorting the maximum political benefits from the Zick virus problem.
Last week, the National Health Institute announced that it had initiated clinical trials of vaccines against Zick virus with 80 people and hoped to start the second phase of the Zick virus epidemic countries at the beginning of 2017.
However, as officials stated on Thursday, without immediate additional funding, the study will stop.
Barvela said that she would direct the fight against the Zick virus to USD 34 million from the National Health Service for the search for medicinal products against other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.
A further 47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical In-depth Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of medicines and vaccines in response to emergencies in the field of public health.
This money will come from a number of accounts, including USD 19 million from a programme providing heating fuel subsidies to low-supported families, and USD 4 million from substances dependence programmes such as opioid dependence.
Even as Barvela said, additional money will be sufficient only for the next month when the agencies will have to 'majorly narrow their activities' in the fight against Zicon virus if the Congress does not act.
Over the last four months, the Disease Control and Prevention Centre has spent USD 60 million to help states protect pregnant women, USD 25 million to strengthen their readiness to the Zic virus and plans to fight it, as well as USD 16 million to help it develop data collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zic virus-related symptoms.
Thai leader binds attacks on tourist favorite places with constitutional changes
The Thai Head of Hunt called on the people of the country on Friday to be patient until the investigators find out what is behind this week's explosion of the killing bomb in Thailand.
General Prajut Chan-och, Head of Hunta and Prime Minister, said that the criminals were 'bad people' who protested against the new Constitution, which was approved by the voters in the referendum on Sunday.
"It is still bad people, and they acted already before the referendum," he said to the people.
Four and dozens of people were killed and injured during the bomb explosions in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including Phuket and Huahine, among tourists.
The authorities claim that the attacks of burners are related elsewhere in the country.
Analytics claim that the aim of bomb explosion was not to kill many people, but to harm the tourism industry, one of the bright points of the Thai economy.
At least nine foreign tourists were injured in Huanhin.
"Whether motives, explosions and burners attacks overturn the hunt's claim that the post-referendum situation will be stable," said Sunai Fasku, the oldest researcher of Human Rights Watch.
These attacks have the discrediting consequences of the authorities, terrorize the public and undermine the economy based on the tourism sector.
Photo Thai rescue staff are caring for the injured by the Friday bomb explosion in Huahine.
The police claim that, in their view, these explosions are not related to international terrorism or long-standing Islamic turmoil in southern Thailand.
They consider attacks as 'local sabotage' rather than terrorism.
The time and location of attacks have strong political symbolism.
The explosion took place on Friday, when people were prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikita, which is considered to be the day of Mother in Thailand.
Four explosions collapse in the Royal Residence of Huahine, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where the majority were also injured.
The Constitution prepared by the military will reduce the influence of political parties and give military people greater powers even if the government is again under the control of civilians.
Hunta helped to ensure its victory by preventing opponents from holding campaigns against it.
Murey Hybert, a South-East Asian expert at the Strategic and International Studies Centre in Washington, pointed out the suspicion of militarists that the attacks were carried out by unsatisfied people.
The explosives were "precisely coordinated, but obviously targeted to the creation of fear and anxiety, not mass damage and damage and injury," he said.
Last year, 20 people, mostly tourists from China, were killed at the popular Erevan temple in Bangkok.
Thai officials binded the explosions of uighur fighters who were dissatisfied with more than 100 ughur returns to China.
General Prejutt, who has led him since 2014, when the civilian government was actively dismissed, said that this week's explosion "is painting the hearts of the Thai."
Why now, when the country is going better when the economy goes better, and the tourism sector is going better?" he said.
We have to ask why and who did.
Golden reaction: as the historical moment of Simones Manuel looked like
When I started fighting this evening, I was trying to remove the gravity of the black community from my shoulders, which is something I have not taken with myself simply in such a position.
I hope, however, that all this will be away.
I am more than happy about the fact that I can serve others inspiration and hopefully diversify this sport.
At the same time, however, I would like to have a day when we are more, and that is not Simone, a black swimper, because the name of a black swimper makes it look like I shouldn't have been able to fight a golden medal or that I shouldn't have been able to overwhelm records.
This is not the case because I work as hard as everyone else, and I love sport and I want to win as everyone else.
The fight against the protection of students - people of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgenic (L.G.B.T.) - in Colombia
Two years ago, Sergio Urrego, a 16-year-old, collapsed from the shopping centre in Bogot, left a message about his suicide in the Facebook record, quoting the Pink Floyd song "Goodbye Cruel World" ("The Worthy World of Artists").
His death was the beginning of the conflicts that emerged this week in Colombia, where efforts to extend the rights of L.G.B.T. were viewed in the broader political struggles that have divided the country into two camps.
After his death, Urrego's mother Alba Reijesa , lodged a complaint against school officials to blame them for excluding her only son when it was found that he and his classmate had intimate relations.
A year later, the Supreme Court of Colombia issued a positive judgment inviting schools across the country to develop a clearer policy to prevent discrimination.
The decision was part of a series of legal victory for the movement of gay rights in Colombia.
However, this week, in their fight for equality, they encountered an obstacle, because Jean Perody, the Minister of Education, who is openly gestic, had a scandal about the application of this rule in the scandal.
The scandal began when the social media began to circulate sexually open content from the pornography magazine, distributing the message that it was part of the guide published by the Ministry of Education.
Perodia is active in blinding it.
Although the Ministry offered schools assistance on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity with the idea to help them draw attention to the rule, it has not attempted to impose standardised rules.
"What we want for schools is the tools to solve conflicts," Mrs Perdodia said on Thursday's interview.
The debate started before the national debate on the future in a country where peace negotiations will take place between the government and the political armed forces of Colombia, or the FARC, the party group.
The political coalition in the opposition of the government and the leaders of the Catholic Church have been very quickly mobilised, accusing the government of the president Huana Manuel Santos for the promotion of one-sex union and gender change.
In order to make it even more difficult for everyone, a government delegation participating in negotiations with FARC in Havana recently reached an agreement on gender and equality between L.G.B.T. with which the government is invited to adopt more inclusive policies.
The government's criticism and the peace negotiations that have been held on the 42-year-old Perodia, Colombia's political consoling star.
They have shown a paupio posters in myths, and some have also threatened to provoke violence against him and her partner, the former Minister for Trade, Cecilia Alvares-Correa Glena.
Perodia retained a marvelous peace during the week of all the alarms, trying to correct the mistake and restart the debate under constructive conditions.
"It is partly what forces me to stand and keep a clear head is the consciousness that there are children who will still discover," she said.
This is a very tight field of work and very lonely time.
She also pointed out the relationship between the peace process and the debate on students of L.G.B.T.
While the Columbians continue to assess the benefits of a transaction with the FARC, which would be a turning point similar to the earthquake in the country, they have to think about the emergence of the conflict, she said.
"Is a peaceful country that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?" she asked.
Although she has not been pleased to be the target of accusations and accusations this week, she is pleased that in modern Colombia gay students can take an example from her and think that they can also try to become ministers a day.
"I am very important that they are calm and aware that they can fully realise their potential," said Mrs Perodia.
We cannot expect a new suicide to start changing something.
Save the vote cybersecurity - The New York Times
"USA is looking for ways to keep hackers away from the election uranium" (information article, August 4)
The Minister of Internal Security, Jah Johnson, says that Obama's administration is thinking of additional protection of the security of the national electoral system.
These changes may be necessary and should be considered immediately.
Cyber threats in various manifestations and the recent discovery that external forces, perhaps national states, are increasingly interested in the influence of our elections, demands that the federal government pay extra attention to the provision of our electoral system and may consider it to be part of the infrastructure essential to our country.
Johnson should immediately communicate with thousands of state jurisdictions that help to carry out elections and offer assistance, advice and guidance from the Department of Internal Security.
While the diverse and diverse nature of our voting infrastructure hinders our efforts to ensure it, it tells us that the process should be started as soon as possible.
The writer, a democrat from Mississippi, is a member of a high rank of the National Security Committee.
Pennsylvania, a boy injured in cows, this week as the third case in attraction parks
On Thursday, a boy injured by a carusel and moved to the Pittsburgh Hospital. The emergency service and the park officers say this week this is the third accident in the US attraction parks affected by children.
A child whose name is not discovered was only taken to a child’s hospital in Pittsburgh, about 50 miles [80 km] west of the Aidlvailda and the Soukzone attraction park in Laidjonier, Pennsylvania, said a representative of the emergency services in the region of Vestmūrland.
The three-year-old boy who visited his brother while he was being helped on the ground was conscious, in e-mail informed the park representative Jeff Crushor.
Crushor said that the attraction "Rollo Coaster" will be closed for the period of investigation of the event.
For children, at least 3 feet (91 cm) in order to be able to visit the carusel, and those less than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by adults.
The attraction, according to the information published on its website, was built in 1938, and the Department of Agriculture of the State indicated that it was tested in August.
The hospital representative refused to comment on the health situation of the boy.
On Sunday, a 10 - year - old boy died from the world’s highest water mountain in Cansassis, Cansas.
On Monday, three 6, 10, and 16 - year - old girls were delivered to the hospital, who dropped from more than 30 feet [9 m] high, turning around the panoramic wheel trade in Grinvila, Tenesia, reports local media.
The Japanese Prime Minister, Abe, will not visit the Pentecost of World War II, where the memory of the fallen war is glorified: Jiji
The news agency Jiji reports that the Japanese Prime Minister, Sindzo Abe, will not visit a controversially-rated Tokyo temple that honors the memory of the fallen in the war on the second anniversary of the World War.
On Thursday, Jiji reported that Abe was going to send Jasukuni to the temple of ritual gift for the anniversary.
The temple also honors 14 Japanese troops who were convicted as war criminals, and China and South Korea view it as a symbol of Japanese militaryism.
Abe has not visited the temple since December 2013, when he declared that he has visited it to show respect for those who died for their homeland.
Thomas Inada, a new Japanese defence minister, did not answer the question whether she would visit the temple, explaining that it was a question of conscience.
Inada - a close supporter of the amendment to the Abe-Abe-Japan Pacifist Constitution - has regularly visited Jasukuni in the past.
The news agency Kyodo reports that, on Thursday, the Minister of Reconstruction of Territories affected by Japan's disaster, Masahiro Imamaura visited the temple and said that he prayed for Japan's peace and prosperity.
The relationship between China and Japan, the two major economies of Asia, has become more tensiond after the increasing presence of Chinese coast guards and other state vessels in the vicinity of the disputed islands in the South China Sea, which is referred to as Senkak in Japan, but in China as Diaouge.
Two suspects in the planning of Rio Olympic Games terrorism: police
On Thursday, the police detained two people suspected of supporting the Islamic State as a possible attack on planning during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Before the fourth operation, the police had already detained 12 persons, all suspected of co-operation with Islamic fighters.
The Brazilian Federal Police reports that three additional persons were interviewed and subsequently released.
The two arrested on Thursday are Brazilians, but the police do not disclose their names and other information.
Although there have been no conflicts in Brazil's history with the known groups of fighters, the government reports that, due to the Olympic Games, the country has become a more topical target, especially because the countries fighting against the Islamic State are participating in the games.
Its fighters control certain territories of Iraq and Syria, and the US-led coalition has conducted air attacks against them.
The group has supporters around the world, who have committed fire and explosion to civilians.
The new suspect is officially accused of the murder of the French priest
In the last month's investigation of the murder of the French priest against the first-day arrested man has been accused, Friday Reuters reported the source of information in the police.
The 21-year-old suspects have been subjected to investigations on cooperation with terrorists, and they have planned to attack humans, mentioned the source of information.
As a man, he contacted Adel Kermich and Abde Malic Petjan, who stopped church service in St. Evan du Ruve, West France, July 26, and cut the tool to a 85 - year - old Roman Catholic priest Jacques Amel.
Both police shot.
The suspect came from his home near Tuluza, to St. Peter du Ruve, and spent the night there in days before the attack, mentioned the source.
The young man, who had not previously been criminally sentenced, acknowledged that he had spent the night there, but told the investigators that he had gone the next day because he had no good relationship with Kermich and Petitjan, said the source of information.
The investigators are trying to find out whether Kermich and Peter were involved in France and whether they were related to the Islamic State that took responsibility for the attack.
At the end of last month, the brother of Petjan was subjected to pre-trial arrest.
Doruss de Vriess before moving to Celtic pass medical tests
Nottingham Forest Club Gategory Dorus de Vriess arrived in Glasgow because he hopes to conclude an agreement on the transition to Celtic.
De Vriess was photographed, we entered the Roshol hospital before the medical examination after Hoops agreed on conditions with Sky But Champions Club.
Brendan Rodgers, the manager of the Parkhead club, is looking for an experienced centre guard so that the current first room Craig Gordon has competition.
However, Roger trusts the 35-year-old de Vries, because he has worked together with the Dutchian in the Swansea club.
He played 51 game in Swansea, which under Rogers leadership in 2011 won the right to move to Prime Minister.
He changed the form of the Wales to join "Vilkai", and since 2013 is City Earth.
He has also played during his career in Scotland after the season of Diunfermline, after the transition in 2006.
His stay in the Impendant ended with frustration, but, Pars experienced a double agony, being "sended to exile" from the highest level, before the loss of Celtic Scotland Cup.
The guard under the contract had still left the year in Forest, and it was reported that Celtic would have to pay only a nominal fee to obtain his signature.
Macy's gonna close 100 stores.
The large shop gigant Macy's announced on Thursday its plans to close 100 stores, which is a dramatic step towards helping the shop chain to get forward from the potentially inflamed problem: in America, it says there are too many shops in the online shopping era.
Macy's regularly reduces the portfolio of its store, often closing several dunes of a poorly profitable shop immediately after the annual holiday fever.
However, when it comes to its summer statement that it will close up 15 percent of its 728 trading venues, the shop chains seem to have a much more aggressive position than many similar retailers in terms of reducing their stores, adapting to the very changing shopping environment.
The guests and buyers go through the Macy's store in New York.
Retail giant declares that it intends to close 100 stores.
Macy's has many reasons to try to change: many of its shops are located in small regional shopping centres, as the number of buyers has been particularly affected by the prosperity of e-commerce.
The overall category of supermarkets has become more difficult, as purchasers increasingly choose lower price retailers such as T.J.Maxx and fast fashion works such as H&M.
These factors, along with short-term difficulties, such as ever smaller international tourist spending and seasonless weather conditions that Macy's has put in a fragile situation that lasts longer than a year.
On Thursday, the company announced that its comparable sales in the last quarter had fallen by 2,6 %, a relatively weak indicator, which however was an improvement in view of the very bad drop in 6,1 percentages in the year, which was found in the previous quarter.
The retailer's revenues were $5.87 billion (at $7.64 billion in Canada) and 3.9 percent less than in this period last year.
Macy's said that the closure of the store would cost it about USD 1 billion per year in terms of turnover.
And the closure of such a large number of shops could at the same time be considered as recognition of the collapse of the retailer.
However, the value of the company’s shares decreased by 17 per cent on Thursday, suggesting that investors perceive this move as a proactive measure that tells Macy’s a stronger future.
In some respects, the fact that Macy's reduces the number of stores should not be surprised.
Director-General of the retailer Tery Lundgren has previously said that there are quite simply too many stores in the chain.
The highest level leaders have been saying for some time that they have adopted a new strategy, with a special emphasis on 150 of its most profitable shops, trying to achieve higher sales in the already advantageous trading venues.
Jeff Jenete, the Director of Macy, who has been appointed instead of Lundgren since 2017, said in his communication almost all stores that the company intends to close are those where sales volumes and profits fall down.
"We are aware that in these trading venues we still do not obtain adequate returns on investment and often do not have a level of buyer purchasing experience that reflects our efforts in relation to Macy's brand," said Jenete.
The company announced that it would present a list of stores that would be closed later.
Macy's said that there is still a decision on closed stores and that therefore it is not yet accurately known how many employees will be dismissed.
The retailer will not completely come from the main markets where it currently has shops, but it will think about closing shops that are located in less active locations.
This move will most likely not like shopping centre managers who count on large tenants like Macy's to attract and hold other smaller shops in their shopping centres.
Do you have dangerous bacteria in your water bottle?
According to a new study, drinking from a refilled bottle may be "world much worse than dropping your dog's toy", taking into account how many bacteria will have to come into contact.
Website Treadmill Reviews instructed EmLab P&K to check 12 four different types of water bottles - with screwing cord, with a flip-off cord, with a sealing cord, and with a strap.
Each bottle was used by the athlete for a week without washing.
Your refillable water bottle may be as dirty as the dog’s toy.
"On the basis of 12 bottles of water we tested, we found that the reusable drinking containers can be a worrying number of viable bacterial cells: more than 300 000 colonies forming units per square centimeter (KVV/q.cm.)," says Treadmill Reviews.
The largest number of microbes, more than 900 000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CVV/q.cm) were found in bottles with displaced caps.
The bottles included microbials that may cause skin infections, pneumonia or blood poisoning.
Bottles with compressable corks were the worst of the next with 162,000 CFU/q.cm, while containers with screwing corks contain only slightly less than 160,000 CFU/q.cm.
"Drink water from such bottles may be worse than eat from your pet's container", is indicated on the website.
A well better picture is observed for bottles with straw, where only part of the bacteria in the other bottles were found - only 25 CFU/q.cm.
This could be because water drops to the lower part of the straw rather than sticks to its edges and thus attracts humidity-loving microbuses.
In bottles with straw, the microbes are described as "mostly safe".
"On the basis of our test results, we recommend that we select a bottle with straw, because of the low number of bacteria and the absence of harmful microbes," mentioned on the website.
We also know that when it comes to bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.
In addition, there will be fewer microbes in water bottles without gaps and difficult to clean.
The website recommends that readers wash bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleaching solution.
Religion must become modern or go forgot
In the United States, the Democratic Party has recently nominated Hilaria Clinton as its presidential candidates.
If the results of the last surveys prove true in their own elections, in January America will inaugurate its first President - the woman.
Last week, over the ocean, British Prime Minister Teresa Mey discussed British withdrawal from European rules with German Chancellor Angel Merkel.
Women raised in Western society have been raised in such a way that they can be competent and successful in any field of professional activity thanks to education, ambition and hard work.
And today, young girls can target a number of existing models, acting in the field of highest leadership.
So is the really long and heavy fight for equality between women finally over?
Happy Clinton is ready to become President of the US at any time, but in the field of religion, women's leadership is still a disputed issue.
Okay, not completely.
In the field of religion, women's leadership remains a disputed issue.
Last week, Pope Francisco announced the creation of a new commission to assess whether women would be sanctified at the Catholic Church.
The English Church blessed Libya Lein as the first woman-bishop in January 2015, but it was only after a failed attempt in 2012.
While the reform of the Judaism movement of women in the rabbi round has been initiated since the beginning of the 1970s and the conservative movement since the beginning of the 1980s, the orthodox Judaism still has a very strong resistance to the concept of female rabin.
In November 2015, the American Orthodox Rabbi Council, in its third attempt to stop the growing wave of support for the administration of Orthodox women in the Rabbi round, published a very harsh message that the concept of women-rabbi is contrary to the law.
Not without irony, when the Queen Clinton was nominated as candidates for the President of Democrats, the group of American leading Orthodox Rabbi, who oppose women's administration, launched a series of 'debate' on this disputed issue.
Why is this difference between the secular and the crack?
Orthodox Jewishism, like most other religions, seeks stability in what it considers to be long - term traditional values.
This is reflected in the ability to keep pressure on the changing society.
Those who are against women's administration do so on the grounds that it is not 'traditional'.
However, it is a price to maintain a traditional perception in this way.
And the price of such unilateral thinking can paradoxically ruin the tradition itself, depriving the traditional community of oxygen that it needs to maintain life.
In the book "August Firearms", in the military history of the First World War, Barbara Tačmena stresses how dangerous it is to give priority to the tradition of the one that has become known as the "red bike tragedy".
Until the beginning of World War I, when war went from war in the nearby distances to a more heavy artillery that was broadcast from a further distance, it became useful to hide the soldiers as long as possible.
The British and German army responded to these changes by replacing their bright uniforms with boring grey and brown.
However, French soldiers still weared the same red hats and pants that made them easy.
The French Minister for Military Affairs, Adolfa Mesimi,'s suggestion that the army under his authority could act in a similar way, was perceived by ridicule and resistance.
The red pants reflected the pride and prestige of the army, and the military traditionals were not prepared to abandon it.
The former Minister of Military Affairs, Mr Eižens Etjen, spoke on behalf of France, speaking to Parliament.
"Don't give up the red pixels?" he called.
Never!
"It was a non-expressive and idiotic attachment to the most visible of all the colors," then wrote the Messiah, "it was to have the evil consequences."
Faith leaders who are struggling to involve women in the leading religious roles could fall into the same trap.
Concentrating only on "traditional" religion, rather than asking an important question: "What changes are needed for religion to flourish?" they risk losing about 50 percent of their followers.
They also deprive the entire community of talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise provide.
Insist that men continue to wear pants when they talk about religion may be traditional, but, as the rush of red knives shows, it may not be worth it.

The children of Roja district learned new skills in the camp.
From 1 to 6 August the Rojupe Centre for Children and Youth Initiatives took place camp "Varavīksnes tilti", during which participants were creatively manifested, sported, and acquired new skills.
We arrived in the camp on the final day when children with a great passion were painted by glass jars.
Maria Folkmane, a youth specialist at the Rojupes Centre for Children and Youth Initiatives, said that this was one of the most enjoyed activities for the participants.
A visit to the Einārs Kalniņš table "Mazbriņi" was also a great pleasure.
The majority of children liked laser gravier because it was possible to see how the drawing on the computer is gradually applied to the son.
E. Kalniņš has told you what things to learn in school if he wants to work in the table, namely, mathematics, especially geometry, computer knowledge, and technical drawing and drawing.
He also emphasised the need to work more with the brain than muscles in this profession.
The small cemetery is individual orders, and it is important first to plan everything.
In order to get to know each other better, participants participated in different games at the beginning of the camp, as well as jointly formed the camp's "gorgons".
On Wednesday, there was a move along the sea from Roja to Žocene, and natural materials were collected on the road which were later used to make cards.
There were also sports games that are particularly important for the participants.
We went to multi-apartment houses where we had a sports and recreational area, and played a football and networking ball.
Children like sports activities, we have a lot of boys playing football, basketball, and each time they require something sports.
Girls like more peaceful jobs.
The next day, with the help of self-suffering masses, we decorate the jars that will later be used as pencil holders.
There was also a evening of talent, and children chose what they would do with, and one evening was devoted to the performances.
The table games were also played, each of them could show their knowledge at a time of photo orientation, where after the pictures had to find objects and take pictures with them.
The task was to get together in each picture differently.
We also painted mandalas - some like more, some less.
Never will there be one lesson that will be enjoyed by everyone - another is closer to sport, another to creative lesson.
"Today it seems that everyone is passionately working with glass painting," explains M. Folkmane.
At the end of the camp, diplomas on creativity, sports and help were issued - several children helped directly in economic works.
The name of the camp "Varavīksnes tilti" was created because of the participation of children from three associations – Rojupes and Blacksil Children and Youth Initiative Centre, as well as the Roja District Multifunctional Centre "Strops".
These are such single bridges.
If the wizards find something faster, we borrow ideas; if vice versa, then they borrow from us.
We share experiences.
This year 30 participants were involved in the camp - children who were active during the year.
"There's going to be 30, and it's coming," says M. Folkmane.
The camp was held for the fifth year.
It started in 2010, when the social service in Roja district decided that many families and children of poor families need to organise camps in summer.
However, in the meantime, the situation in Paradise has improved, and the camp is currently for the population of the district, who are coming and operating in youth centres.
The aim is to spend free time in a meaningful and comprehensive manner.
Two camps were held in the past and 20 children were attended in each of them, while now only one camp is organized due to a decrease in the number of children in the country as a whole.
Similar activities are taking place over the rest of the year.
The children draw, paint glass, came to the villages of Einārs Kalniņš, who taught wooden burning, car production from wood, with figurative saws we saw in different shapes.
There is also a new technique - encastics, it's a color with hot wax cream.
Teacher Ilze Shelkov, under the direction of the teacher, was involved in the production of polymer material, we formed colons and various containers.
We make paintings from natural materials, interesting mandalas from beans, peas, linseeds, in autumn we collect leaves.
We're trying to use what we're around.
The youth center works from 15.00 to 20.00 in winter and in summer from 14.00 to 20.00.
"The average number of 15 children visits the youth centre," says M. Folkmane.
She stresses that great support is provided by the Rhoa City Council, which understands that it is necessary to allocate funds to children because they form our future.
Charlton Athletic fans "can get a seasonal ticket only if they sign a contract of conduct" and will agree not to criticise the club in social media.
Although we recognise that everyone has the right to his own opinion, the publication of confusing comments on such websites does not come in favour of.
In the area of administration, the fan was then told that he would have to receive a ticket personally from the former police senior inspector Klifa Īger, who joined the club last month after 35 years of career in the police forces.
In the following letter: "I must inform you that the award of the seasonal ticket will be renewed on condition that you sign "Agreed Conduct Treaty" (ABC), which will determine that you will refrain from publishing deprived or confusing comments on people representing the clubs or clubs on all kinds of social media websites, or any other kind of behaviour that could be considered as antisocial."
With Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after the seasonal ticket fee, which was not received, and two days later a letter was received.
Yesterday he went to the club and said: "They told me that I was too much "twittered" by making the twisted also to others who are funny."
Wheeling holidays on the coasts of the Dalmation
What do you think with the word "luxury"?
I was driving here from all the power," said Kolina, the former U.S. naval commander, who just driven a 25-mile cycling trip along the central part of an uneven island of Croatia, without leaving anything there, except for the spicious expression of sweats and zalves sultained by seafarers, educated in hostile mountains.
Some wheelchairs sing anthem or a number of nursery poems to make it easier to get to the mountain.
Colin's girlfriend Pete recommends "The Little Engine That Can".
Others of the number or simply suffer silently, thinking of what it requires to reach a trans-like state of the ruined wheelchairs.
Colina ladders are more poisonous than diverse.
Drive a few yards forward to her is as if Hjū Grant was hinged as at the beginning of the film "Cetra wedding and one funeral".
Her and my mission are a week-long "luxury" yacht and a bike journey along the coast of the northern division of Croatia and the islands organised by Freedom Treks.
Wheeling on the summer heat of mountains like Croatia may not correspond to every idea of luxury, but it is said that the North division is easier to drive than the South division, our seel is soft, and when we filled out the forms of reservation, freely and convincingly before all those months, there was a box that we could have been able to provide us with the battery-loaded e-wheel.
The luxury part of the transaction is our swimming house for a week, a very new "Melody".
At the end of the journey, we can liken our bicycles at our guides, Ivana and Ivana, and at the end of the ship, jump a hearing in blue water without touching the seabirds, sharp stones and other people on the narrow stone bars called the Croatian beach.
In June, the temperature of the sea is perfect, everyone agrees: enough cool to cool, but not cold.
On "Melody" there are masks and breathing shades and some jaws, if any feel energetic after a heavy morning on the blankets.
Instead, most of us are returning to our cabins with air conditioners, where Helen, the massier of the ship - I don't joke - will have already covered our beds, has complemented our minibar stocks and have left a new box with shock loads on the table.
Ivan says that the ride after cycling is very important, and we learn to ride on our beds or with cushions on the upper deck with the bartender Antonio, who is always ready to prepare one of his cocktails.
"Melody", 42 m long with 15 cabins and a half-double crew, is not an immersed superjahta, but a stylish small cruise ship.
It turns to a small island port between fishing vessels and fleet vacation yachts, and we are proud that we belong to it.
Colina and Petey belong to the meetingup.com group of friends from Washington (in the region of Columbia): at the sports and public activists after 45, as they call themselves.
Last year, the large boats and bike holidays in the Netherlands were so good that they decided to try something more for adventures, and so they are now in Croatia.
The competitive capillary from their church is boating and cycling on holidays in Provans, and every afternoon air is thickened by the Pingpong Rally of competitive Facebook publications.
The element of holiday adventures can be exaggerated, because our schedule is nothing if there is no specific regime.
"Brockasti and dinner are in eight," Ivan announced to the new participants at the opening meeting when we started the road from the beautiful old port of Trogira near Splita.
One signal of the ship’s call shows that the bufet is open, and the other at the end of the meal calls for silence and careful listening to the following information.
"Labrīt!" is a cultural context that is probably lost everywhere, but not in the British contingent.
What a difference - fun has already taken turns, joki blows like from the horn of the superb, while Ivana delivers day-to-day tour cards, but we all feel that we are scared of swinging, contour leaks and profiles with rises and falls, although anything else would be a surprise in Croatia's bike, which begins and ends at sea level.
"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.
Fully equality is not recommended.
Ivan leads an information meeting in parallel, freely switching from English to German.
There are weeks when he needs to deal with a dozen different nationalities, but we are a simple group - the Swiss, the German, the American and the British, who easily sit at the tables during meals, where two speak English and one speak German.
We're all friends on the road.
Wheeling promotes membership, and the only competition is inside, i.e. with itself.
I do not remember when the group’s dynamics would have been more harmonious and relaxed.
Soon we are mooding on the Ivan wave.
A small increase is a slope that should not be mixed with inequality, which is a good thing.
The hairstyles are serpentins and straight forward means straight: simple, but not always easy.
Wheeling instructions are always the same: "Braw by one, withstand the distance, and they are not a race.
We're seeing the coastline in nine.
All right, five pairs, I forgot you're on holidays.
Take a lot of water with you.
We will go from Trogira in a two-day cruise north through the archipelago of Cornati, where we will leave Dugi Otok - in Croatian language "the long island" - and, after a little money, we will go walking along the Telaksticia nature park by admiring its standing rocks and salt lake, where seawater flows through the underground channel.
It is said that those who earn it thanks to its power become younger.
If we're going to break it, will our legs feel younger and stronger?
In the small island of Molate, we turn to the south again, moving from the continent to the nearby islands seemingly accidentally.
Most of our trips are on empty small roads on the outside of the country with a wide range of views on the sea and a variety of plants: olive barrels, vineyards, sharp herbs, Mediterranean perfumes in air and countless butterflies in flight.
When we go forward, there is always a bride, but when Ivans stops, there is always a big shadow, and the small pimples are like a prize for those who arrive sooner.
Sports and public activists go a lot on bikes at weekends, and they know behavioural standards by sending warnings by line and leaving free spaces so that motto drivers can perform ignition manoeuvres much safer.
"You almost woke up," one cyclist says to the other after the truck driver decided to make a healing manoeuvre in an opaque torque and quickly deteriorated.
Fortunately, the brakes worked.
Ivans divides us into three groups every piece of short stages of driving on the main roads, with Ivan in the very rear, to encourage and "success speed", as Ivans says.
If we need to cross the main road, we all gather, get down from the bicycles, and after moving with our bicycles on the other side, as we have been instructed, not before.
"Do you think Ivan knows that he doesn't speak to a group of children?" asks the Swiss cyclist when we stand on the road and look forward to the signal when we can cross it.
Not all afternoon we can devote to leisure rest.
The city’s visit to Zadar reveals the Roman Forum and the sea organs that play music, which sounds like a role of a prisoned seabed, through a stone-integrated tubing in promenade and open in water.
The famous sunset of Zadar perfectly falls between the main meal and the bottle, and after the coming to darkness we return to the sea organs and observe the wave-driven lamps games in the glass trotuar, which in fact is the dance floor.
When "Melody" early in the morning starts the way to the charming biograde resort, the song of organs is no longer nothing more than just a chick.
On the fifth day, we are completely free from cycling.
The trip up the estuary of the River Krka to see its waterfalls; then afternoon visit to Sibenika, where we look at the cathedral, the studio of the Dalmation Renaissance, as well as the chair-time walk along the peaceful island of Zlarina, looking for its local treasure coral makes this day interesting.
Lurda is going to take blessed roads in the shadow of attack
During the annual Catholic sanctuary, people gather themselves to the Church of Lurda.
The French security forces are in high preparedness because thousands of Catholics gather at Lurda's annual sanctuary on the shadow of several acts of terrorism.
On August 15, each year, tens of thousands of people are gathered at the Pyrenee Mountain Series at the celebration of the heavenly celebration to mark the take-up of Mary in heaven.
This year the blessed journey takes place at a time when the Catholics were shocked by the killing of the oldest French priest on July 26 by two Islamic extremists who invaded the church in the north of France during the mission and turned the tool to him.
The murder of Jacques Amela took place two weeks after a tunisian said that he was radicalized by the jacket videos on the Internet,-- he tried a truck in the Bastillian Day Stupend in Rivjēra City of Nice, killing 85 people.
After three large-scale attacks in 18 months, many French people are cautious about visiting public events.
The number of tourists declined dramatically, and the authorities were concerned that the number of celebrations this year could fall rapidly.
However, the fear of mass withdrawals did not materialise -- and some organisers say that even the inflow of visitors' applications has been observed at the latest.
Some 25 000 believers are expected to arrive, including large groups from Italy and Belgium and some 200 Christian eastern branch, the delegation of Orthodox representatives.
Many of them have declared that they will not be intimidated.
"We do not think to stop living," 66-year-old visitor Kristians said to the AFP, describing prayer as the "one weapon" in the fight against violence.
"It's important to show that life continues," said Matjē Gvinary - one of the coordinators.
We will not abandon our faith, our beliefs, and our way of life simply because some fanatics try to sow fear.
Due to concerns about safety in France since the attack in Nice, a number of large-scale measures have been abolished, including a huge stock market in the northern city of Lilly and a European championship in cycling on this side, which had to take place in Nice in September.
"The last week I lived in fear that my phone will be calling in one call to withdraw applications," said Fabjen in Leszne last weekend, a priest responsible for the conduct of official holiness roads.
"On the contrary, the attacks seem to have mobilised the believers," he said and announced the inflow of the last moment's applications.
The head of the trade association of local hotel staff Kristian Gel confirmed the "increased interest" on the holiness of the attacks.
Around the sanctuary, where Mary in 1858 had appeared to the poor shepherd Bernadete Subirū, there were extremely strict security measures.
Around 250 police officers and two dozens of warriors, including bomb neutralisation experts and experts with explosive search dogs, have been posted for protection.
The bags were checked at the entrance, and the number of access points was reduced from twelve to three.
Ketrin Simcox, who went from northeast England to Lurda at the beginning of this month, described enhanced security measures.
"However, until Thursday morning there were armed guards in the temples, and then the gate (with metal barriers) could only enter by one, as well as the bags were searched," she said, The Local.
"This all scared my three children who were accustomed to Lurda, and it was difficult not to scare them when they asked why this is happening," she said.
It did not damage my impressions, but I was sad about the need for it, and I realized that many people were calmed by these measures.
The Friday Opening Procession route is also shortened - instead of starting in Lurda and moving further to the temple, it will start and end at the temple.
Other measures include closing the airspace for flights above Lurda, closing the streets near the road site and replacing the waste uranium against transparent plastic bags.
The French Minister for the Interior, Bernar Kazenev, will examine security measures on Saturday.
About six million people travel to Lurda each year, making it one of the largest destinations of Catholic celebrations in the world.
Many visitors lead relatives who are ill or disabled and who come to swim in a source cave where Bernadete has seen Mary in the faith of the therapeutic characteristics of the water.
In Tyre, Castio, one of the organizers, described this year's meeting as "not much unusual", given "the threat, as the roots seem to be found in France."
However, he claimed that this would not affect the quality and depth of their experience.
François, a 58-year-old volunteer, who helped sick sabbatical travellers, acknowledged that, in her opinion, the presence of civil warriors dressed in garments was "a little suppressant."
However, if it calms everyone, it's good.
Two injured persons are challenged by the Saragos shopping centre
Two people were seriously injured after a man discovered the fire at the shopping centre in Saragos northeast Spain.
The incident took place at 11 a.m. on Friday morning in the Aragonia Aragonia shopping centre in Saragosa.
The original reports show that the shooter could have shot a woman who could be his former partner.
After shooting, the armed criminal escaped, and the police are currently looking for him.

Opening of the waterbird hunting season is nearing.
The waterbird hunting season is opened every second of August.
This year it will start on 13 August at 16:00, so the State Police invites both hunters and citizens to be particularly careful and to comply with security rules.
Waterbird hunting takes place not only in hunting areas but also in public water storage areas, and although weather conditions do not give weight as other years, it is possible for recreational workers to use these water storage facilities together with hunters.
Both hunters and recreational people and those living near the water bodies are invited to be particularly cautious in the vicinity of lakes and rivers and to comply with safety rules, thus not jeopardising themselves or others.
Since it has been observed in previous years that the first days of the season opening of waterbird hunting involves a large number of hunters, the State Police will also perform enhanced hunting control in cooperation with the State Forest Service this year.
In the course of control, the law enforcement will focus on compliance with the rules of the movement of weapons and ammunition, as well as on monitoring that hunting takes place without the influence of alcohol drinks and irrigating substances.
The police recall that the use of semi-automatic firearms in waterbird hunting is prohibited, with a total capacity greater than three patrons, including the amendments to the Law on the Move of Arms and Special Means, in particular Article 22 (91), which states that persons with trophies or high energy pneumatic weapons registered for hunting or sport and short stops up to two hours when these weapons are transported to or from hunting, are entitled to keep weapons and ammunition in the vehicle during hunting, but must be placed as safely as possible in order to avoid the presence of a futal or other packaging containing a ammunition or a weapon from the outside of the vehicle, located behind the locked doors and equipped with an alarm device so as to ensure that they are not accidentally placed in the hands of non-participating persons.
The police call for care for the safety of their and their fellow people during the hunting season and, if you consider the offences or any threat to safety, we invite you to report promptly by phone 110.
In the event of any threat, the law enforcement authorities are ready to respond to the information provided by citizens.
The New Caledonia Coastal Strict 7,2 magnitude earthquake
The New Caledonia coasts were shaken by the 7,2 magnitude earthquake, and the seismologists stated that there was no threat to the tsunami.
The epidemic of the earthquake was located nine kilometres depth 109 kilometres east of New Caledonia Ilanthera at 1.26 p.m. in Grinich time (p.m. 4.26 p.m. in Latvia), reported by the U.S. Geology Research Centre.
The Pacific Cunami Alert Centre has pointed out that there are no warnings or recommendations at present in relation to possible threats to the region of cunami.
"The earthquakes in this region, as is known, are not unusual, including activities in recent times," said the research centre "Geoscience Australia" Senior Seismolog Phil Kamins.
Potentially, it could be felt in Vanuatu or New Caledonia, but I doubt whether it is so strong to cause damage.
New Caledonia is located in the Fire circle - the Pacific tektonic activity area, where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur frequently.
Colombia and Venezuela shall agree on the opening of the border.
Colombia and Venezuela agreed to open the control posts at the border of both countries, which had been closed a year ago on the initiative of Venezuela, by the Presidents of Colombia and Venezuela, Huan Manuel Santos and Nicholas Maduro, on Thursday.
Initial border points will only be open to pedestrians.
From Saturday to 20 a.m. every day, five border points will be opened.
It will be possible to open the border to transport following the conclusion of separate international agreements on security, trade and energy, as pointed out by the presidents.
In August last year, Maduro forced the border to close, in response to the attack on the Venezuela border of Columbia fighters.
Three soldiers of Venezuela were injured in this attack.
In July, Venezuela opened the border twice on a unilateral basis because of the sharp economic crisis: the Hungarians in poverty tried to break the border to buy the first-need goods in border stores.
This opportunity was used by 200 000 citizens of Venezuela.
This time our time is one of the prides of Latvia, the sympathetic Madar Palameic.
Madara Palameika was born on 18 June 1987 in Talsi.
She is a Latvian lightness that starts in a weeping competition.
Her coach is Father Gint Palameik.
Latvia's record record was sneaked in the meagre.
Participated in the 2012 summer Olympics, participated several times in the World and European Championship (the 4th place taken in the 2014 European Championship), and won 3th place in the 2015 Diamond League overall assessment.
Facebook applies to the fighting advertisers.
The world's most used social network Facebook has transmitted such as a warning shot, making it aware that the blocking of advertising banners using special tools is not acceptable and will also have to watch advertising for users.
The popularity of special advertising blockers is increasing, but this means that companies whose main income is directly advertising are declining.
Facebook has now made it known that it is well understood the harmful nature of advertising banners, but users will also have to live with them.
It is true that they will be provided with tools to choose what type of material they are displayed, reports BBC.
"When we provide people with more and more control options, we will also start to show advertisements to those who use advertising blocking software", said the Vice President of Business Andrew Bosvorts.
In other words, users will be able to choose what type of advertisements they see by selecting brands and sectors that seem interesting to them.
"The people don't like to see advertisements that do not apply to them or interfere with the enjoyment of content", added Bosvorts.
Advertisement blocking tools are usually not working on mobile devices, from which Facebook receives the largest visit, but the reduction in banner exposure caused by them is also measured in billions in terms of money.
According to BBC, about 200 million people use advertising blockers.
It has already been reported that in the previous quarter of the business year Facebook's advertising revenues amounted to USD 6.2 billion, or €5.55 billion.
It should be said that this is not the first time Facebook actively participates in determining what network users see in their news flows.
As one of the last steps, Facebook has just started to take action to remove or at least limit the titles of "sounds" from the news streams, behind which, in fact, the "empty" messages are hidden.
At night, asphalt works will be carried out on the street of freedom; traffic restrictions must be taken into account.
Tonight, asphalt installation works will be carried out from Berzaunes Street to Gustava Zemgala Street, and drivers should therefore be taken into account for a limited traffic in this stage of the street.
As the LETA has learned in the Riga Council, traffic restrictions will begin at this stage tonight from 21 p.m. and asphalt works will last until 12 August at 7 p.m.
The traffic towards Juglu will be directed through the tram rails.
Drivers must take account of the limited traffic at this stage and the additional time spent on the road.
The Municipality calls for understanding to respect the restrictions imposed and to comply with the rules of the organisation of traffic.
The renovation of the Seguma started on the main streets of the capital city - Freedom Street from Raiņa Bulvāra to Lāčplēša Street and from Air Bridge to Juglas Street, Lāčplēša Street from Salu Bridge to Avotu Street, Juglas Street from Kvēle to Maliena Street and Lielvārdes Street from Gelzavas Street to 84.vidusskole.
The construction works will last until the start of the new school year and they are organised continuously, including in night hours, when mostly asphalt installation is carried out.
Medvedeva Deputy of Riga hides several ministers of the ZZS.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitrija Medvedevas, Arkadijs Dvorkovics, believed in three ministers of the Greens and Farmers Union (ZZS) in a fish processing plant last week visiting Riga.
The informal meeting took place in the fish processing plant "Kaija" and participated in it by the Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis and Minister of Agriculture Jānis Dūklavs, sends the Internet portal "skaties.lv".
That meeting was approved by Reizniece-Ozola.
She explained that during the meeting it was talked about the abolition of sanctions for fish processors, as well as the storage of Incukalns gas.
Contrary to diplomatic practice, the meeting was held without the involvement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The meeting was organized by Russian Ambassador Alexander Vešņakov.
Suspected of more than €130 000 being seized by the accounting officer.
The National Police (VP) Anti-Economic Crimes Administration (ENAP) informed Gita Gžibovska, representative of the VP.
Current information shows that the suspect woman has committed illegal activities for several years and has caused more than EUR 130 000 to the company together.
Given that the company's officials had not closely followed the cash flow and trusted its employee, they only learned about the ongoing machinations after several years.
VP ENAP policemen detained the suspect woman born in 1963 and shot in the company.
In the context of the event, a criminal procedure for misappropriation has been initiated if it has been made to a large extent.
The law on such crime provides for the deprivation of liberty for up to ten years by confiscation of property or without confiscation of property.
A detaine has currently been subject to a security measure which is not related to the deprivation of liberty.
In Estonia, Zick virus antibodies were detected in nine people.
In Estonia, nine human analyses of Zico virus antibodies, which mean that they may have been exposed to this infection, are reported by the Estonian public broadcaster ERR.
The information provided by the laboratory shows that this year Zicon virus tests were carried out in 121 samples and nine of them were positive.
The first cases of Zica have been reported in Finland and Sweden from Estonia nearby.
According to data from the Estonian Health Authority, no case of acute infection of Ziconium virus has been recorded in the country and, in the case of flu-like symptoms, people do not have to carry out Ziconium virus testing, but they should contact their family doctor.
We have found antibodies to IgG (immunoglobulin class G) which demonstrate that the person inspected has been infected with Zick or similar virus at any time.
"It does not mean that the patient has been ill with Zick virus," explained Paul Nabers, head of the Synlab Disease Department of the Laboratory.
Zick's virus is carried by the Ades genus.
In Latvia there is a problem with the development of high-quality car procurement, the vice-president of the Auto Association Ingus Rutiņš said to the Agency in the interview.
It is costly or in the automotive sector there are obvious problems with dumped prices, Rutiņš responded in a confirmatory manner.
Of course.
Car purchases are different from service purchases that make it easier to manipulate prices.
As a result of the end of the car, a certain amount must in any case be paid as it must be purchased from the manufacturer.
However, the problem is and can be classified in two groups.
Either the procuring entity is incompetible and does not intend to create quality procurement, which leads to the fact that it is often unaware of "eep purchases".
"It is whether highly conscious procurement is built so as to get something specific, and then there are now visible various miracles", the vice-president of the Auto Association.
He pointed out that it is currently popular to talk about moving away from the lowest price offer to the most economically advantageous tender as the criterion for determining the winner of the purchase, but some companies still have a false view of these matters.
Now it is very popular - let's go from the lowest price to the most economically advantageous offer!
However, the criteria are to be established in both cases and, when they are taken into account and assessed, the decision is still taken on the basis of the lowest price principle.
In quality procurement, the technical criteria should be very precise and appropriate to the market.
On the other hand, things that can be expressed in terms of money should not be assessed by points.
There is no need to assess fuel consumption, emissions, service services and similar things with points.
The car's expected life cycle, ride, etc. is to be known, and the whole can be counted together.
"The question then is only about where the customer is interested in the scenarios?" explains Rutiņš.
Peter Rubulis, the Head of the Automotive Association, noted that the problems are often related to the fact that the same person makes purchases for both cars and work gloves and food, and these purchases are derived from one model.
We have also brought to the consultation the details of the procurement sample reserves, which were difficult to describe as a detailed absurdity.
"The problem is that the procuring entity very often lacks any understanding of the subject matter of the procurement and the requirements are simply copied from somewhere," said Rubulis.
Rūtiņš, on the other hand, added: the smaller the structure that publishes the procurement is, the more often there are problems.
"Observing this is precisely because of the lack of human resources and competences", said the vice-president of the association.
Latvian volleyballists are not until the fight for medals.
Latvian beach volleyball due Alexander Samoilov and Jānis Šmēdiņš went out of Rio's Olympic Games tournament on Thursday, accelerating (1-2) homes Evandrs Gonsalvešs Oliveirs and Pedro Solbergs Salgadas in the crucial mach.
Our duet won only one victory in three matches, and the D subgroup ranked in the last quarter.
It was quite a lot of embarrassment and afflicted in social networks, so we suggest that we look at the most bright entries from Twitter.
The Riga Festival has started with the market.
Look at the photo as looks in the holiday market in Esplanad.
"Die Antwoord" accuses the "Death unit" for stealing the style.
The South African group "Die Antwoord" accused the director of the film "Suicide Sqaud" ("Suicide Sqaud") for the use of the group's unique examination without permission, calling the honourable director "small-by-small-down mait".
Instagram, the group's leading singer, Jolandi, turned to the director of the film studio "Warner Bros", stating: "That's right, David Ajer, you're stealing our style."
As she says, the film stars of Kara Delavinja and Jard Leto have told you that Ajer was you in the filming area of "Die Antwoord".
"But you didn't ask for permission to cheat us," said the singer.
The 31-year-old musician claims that her group member, Ninja, will contact Ajera with a briefing note on this issue, but he "has nothing answered, like such a small scared mait".
Joland insists that Ajer has taken pictures from the short film "Umshini Wam" in 2011, which shows the hiphopa duet of South Africans.
She also published a video that seems to show that Ajer Joker and Harley Queen had taken pictures from both singers.
Leto himself insists that the inspiration of Joker’s image is based on the imige of David Bowy of the rock.
In the end, Joland has voted against the tough assessment of the critics that the film has earned after its predecession.
Joland and Ninja, in the true words Anrī du Tuata and Vatkin Tudor Jouns, won a fame with three repa studio recordings, promoting African Zef's contraception.

Turkey is looking after the coup attempt of missing diplomats
Turkey seeks at least 32 diplomats who, after the coup attempt of 15 July, did not return to the resigned personnel.
Foreign Minister Mevits Chavušogls said Friday that 208 employees of the Turkish Ministry were withdrawn from the world's jobs to the coup attempt investigation period to Ankara, and 32 have disappeared "without authorisation".
Around 18 000 civilians, military leaders and academics have been arrested or withdrawn from their posts in Turkey, considering them to the Government as being loyal to the US official, Fetullu Gulenu, who is accused of drawing up the government's plan.
Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on the list of the most looking people in Turkey.
Kavosoglu said that the team of the U.S. Department of Justice later this month will visit Turkey to discuss his possible extradition.
This issue has become a problem in the US's relations with Turkey, a member of NATO.
The United States opposed the strong arms tactics of the Turkish President Red Jap Tajjipa Erdogan after the coup, and Turkey responded to this by trying to establish closer links with Russia.
Kavosoglu said that the Turkish military athletes in Greece have escaped to Italy, the athlete in Kuwait tried to escape to Saudi Arabia, but were sent back, and two generals from Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.
He also said that two officials in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one of Russia went to Japan.
Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, quoting military sources, informed that there was also a Turkish military attack in Jordan.
Wall Street Journal, quoting a US official who is aware of this situation, reported that a Turkish military officer based in the NATO Command Centre in Virginia has requested asylum in the US.
There are those who have managed to escape.
Our diplomats have also been refugees," said the NTV broadcaster in the Kavosoglu interview.
Since yesterday, those who were originally withdrawn have expired.
We will take legal action against those who did not return.
The organisers of the Olympic Games are trying to clean up the swimming pool of green gang colors
The Olympic nirators to which the Friday workout was scheduled arrived at the closed pool, because the organizers needed more time to clean the green gang water before the first individual competition in Rio Olympics.
Water suddenly changed the color of Tuesday, synchronised diving in the middle of the race.
The organizers claimed that the water race was safe even after the larger adjacent water pool for pole and synchronised swimming, also colored light green gang.
It was not possible yet when athletes arrived in the morning warming, although finally the pool was opened at 13.00 after local time - only 2 1/2 hours before women 3 meters of competition.
The colour of the water looked closer to its normal colour, but still with a green color.
American Nire Ebia Johnstone, who competes on a tramplin, told her that she came to warm up only to find out that the pool was closed without any warning.
She wrote on the twister that "#FixTheSwamp (swamp the dirt) should be fashionable.
The British Nire Tom Dey, who was fighting in the synchronous platform of bronzes, also commented on the state of the pool in the twitter record.
Hopefully, this means that we haven't been in the last days like very bad!
Mario Andrada, the main speaker of the local committee of organisers, stressed that the pool for competitions is safe, giving green light to 3 meters of frontlights.
He agreed that some athletes had water disturbed, but he said that it was the result of the pool cleaning efforts.
"We repeatedly repeat what we have said all the time: water does not in any way endanger the health of athletes," he said.
On the first day of such a water situation, one or two athletes complained that they itched.
This was the result that the first reaction, when we saw how water becomes green, was to use one of the chemicals - the chlorine - it is used in swimming pools very often.
We have immediately reduced the quantity.
We checked the water again, and this was fully in line with the parameters.
Simon Lengford, the main speaker of the Marie Lenck Watersport Centre, said that the pool was closed for additional cleaning work.
He said that the decision was supported by the world's leading organisation FINA (International Flanders Federation).
"The idea is that the water must be calm, so that the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Lengford said in his statement.
Andrada said that the deterioration of the basin had surprised the organizers unprepared.
"Chemic is not accurate science," he said.
Some things, as you can see, are long.
In the last few days, the production of rain water in normal condition has made it even more difficult.
"Lietus doesn't work," Andrada said.
He added that athletes had access to dry workouts in the morning, but he acknowledged that it was "not perfect."
He explained that the change in the color of the pool was due to increased alkaline levels, like the aquarium water can become green if not properly monitored.
When we started to do something to prevent green color, there were discussions about the best chemicals.
We cannot use too much chemicals in water because athletes are training in it," said Andrada.
We would certainly have been able to take better action at the beginning to prevent water becoming green.
When it became green, we made a mistake again.
AP sports audiences Jay Koen and Steve Ways Rio de Janeiro participated in the creation of this action.
