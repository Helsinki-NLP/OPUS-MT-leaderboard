The Mayor of Bedford, Lin Ognissanti, a Spider of Spiders
In the photo: Lina Ognissanti sells ice cream during the warm season and in winter – crucibles.
Women who traded with cruises and ice creams in the city centre will be honoured for more than 40 years – they will receive a private mayor.
Lina Ognissanti, selling ice creams and crucibles in Dinky Donuts on the street of Bedford Midland Road, was invited together with the family to pope tea.
Almost 3 000 people have signed a petition on the Internet in order to be rewarded or accepted.
Mr Ognissanti said that she was honoured to receive such praise.
According to the Mayor of Bedford, Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognissanti with children and grandchildren was invited to his office to see the city’s regalies and historical artefacts and drink the pope tea.
“Lina Bedforfe takes a special place and her kiosk is part of the city centre,” he said.
I am delighted that she accepted my call, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I can thank Lina for her work in our city."
Mr Ognissanti thanked her, in her words, to the “pleasant” people of Bedford who thought about her, and said: “This is a great honour and a beautiful act.”
The petitioner, Sarkab Mahmooda, said that he was not expected to have such signatures.
When he heard of the reception that was planned to take place by the end of the year, he said: “I am very glad for Linna, because she deserved it because of her excellent character. ”
On the road with the Alsteris Lambretta Club
Lambretta was an unalterable cultural satellite for the 7th century fashion.
The group of Italian motoroler fans is trying to preserve the spirit of those days.
70 years after the first Alster Lambretta club was founded, about 100 motorollers from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered in Fermana county this weekend.
One of the first two members of the club Chris Wilson in 1966 acquired the first Lambretta for about $40.
“I was only a motoroller, but I learned that I could use it otherwise.
It was a kind of sport.
I haven't been involved in fashion culture, and I'm probably too old now," he said.
"He was rather cheap and quite reliable, you could buy it at an affordable price, and he could do something more than just go from point A to point B."
He participated in Lambretta's separate start race in the TT ring of the Isle of Art.
The first Alster Lambretta club was founded in the early 1980s and restructured 12 years ago.
“Approximately 1971, motoropollers and other forms of transport were increasingly dominated by people, and the clubs in general were affected by restlessness, so I thought: “All, this is the end,” Chris said.
"Then, in some time, there was a renewed interest and it seems to have grown more."
Philip Steele is the Secretary for Members of the Lambretta Club, currently holding 97 members.
"All reasons are different.
Some members have been influenced by the culture of fashion, because almost everything started from it.
Others are racing enthusiasts or rockers – here you will find all the people.
There are also those who just have fun vintage.
Many motorolers are modified, so there are no two equals.
It is possible to keep the motoroler and to drive calmly 35 or 40 miles per hour at a speed adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved this.
Some highly modified motoroules could probably reach up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, some motoropollers had to be pushed.
And although the weather of Northern Ireland is not always as pleasant as Lambretta's homelands in Italy, this time the sun educated motorlers driving in Fermana County.
Ruth Davidson asks the towers to silence on "Brexito"
Mr Davidson asked his fellow conservatives for a "style period" so that the Prime Minister could agree on "Brexit".
The head of Scotland Towers said that two years after the EU referendum, there was enough time for the debate.
She expressed her opinion after Boris Johnson’s words on the Prime Minister’s plan, which he called “sound and totally absurd. ”
She said that it was time for the Prime Minister to support the BBC program "Sunday Politics Scotland".
She said at a party conference in Birminga, which led to the tower activists: “In the past two years we have had time to debate.
The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs has served in one of the best offices in the country's history and the majority of the current plan has been drawn up during that period, which has already been recognised in November of last year.
The conservatives must now support the Prime Minister, allow it to complete the transaction and help implement plans in the country.
I think the silence period would be very useful."
Her comments followed the sharp criticism of the Brexito debate, which was not first expressed by former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
In an interview with the BBC journalist Andrew Marro, theresa May later assured that she believed in Brexitu and that its office plan could ensure a favourable free trade transaction with the European Union.
Mr Davidson also stated that the participation in other elections would promise to prevent the second Scottish referendum on independence, because in 2014 "the searchers were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
She asks about the possible re-referendum on "Brexit", she said: "If we talk about Scotland's history, I have repeatedly stated that it is impossible to repeat the referendum if you are nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would change if I said that another referendum on "Brexit" could be held because I expected another result."
Road M8 reopened after the police incident
The highway M8 was opened again after the police incident at Glazg.
According to the police, the road was closed a little earlier than 7.00 p.m. in both directions in 15 Townhead crossings when there was a pedestrian concern.
The traffic on the closed road did not take place for three hours and was disturbed in the city where the marathon “Great Scottish Run” takes place.
The 20-year-old man was subsequently transported to Glasgow’s Royal Hospital for research.
Christine Blasey Ford's friend approved a statement on sexual violence suspecting Brett Kavanaugh's
Lelanda Keyser, who was in high school friendship with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the candidate for the Supreme Court of Brettt Kavanaugh's sexual abuse when both of them were teenagers, wrote a letter to the Committee of the Courts of the Senate, explaining that although he does not remember the house of the party during which the attack may have occurred, but believes in the Ford story.
In the past, Keyser, through his lawyer, issued a statement that he did not remember the party mentioned above and does not even know whether he had met Kavanaugh.
By witnessing before the Committee on the Courts on Thursday, Kavanaugh often referred to Keyser’s statement as proof of his innocence, but did not mention the statement of Keyser that she believed in Ford words.
President Short Friday ordered the FBI to conduct a study within a week when the Senator of Republicans Jeff Flake and other balanced senators asked for time to give the study and delay the vote of the entire Senate on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the Committee by his lawyer, stating that he wanted to “how to contribute to the further investigation by the FBI” on Kavanaugh.
“However, as my client has already explained, she does not know the judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the party or assembly in which he would have been with or without Dr. Ford,” says Keyser attorney Howardo Walsho.
The letter further explains that Keyser “does not reject Dr. Ford's story and has already said to the press that you believe in Dr. Ford's certificate.”
“However, the simplest and indispensable truth is that it cannot confirm it, because it does not remember that event,” the letter continues.
Kavanaugh's friend Mark judge, allegedly near the attack, also claimed that he would contribute to the FTB investigation.
The people of Chicago who have been convicted illegally tell about their lives with a corrupt policeman and his gay
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois tries to change the history of the Chicago police after a dark period.
It is believed that an unfair policeman has exploited innocent social housing populations and has unjustifiedly arrested many people.
42 illegally convicted people have been judged so far.
There is only an empty place left in the place of the project's social housing by Mr Wells, and in the past their populations over the decade almost nothing was exploited by the corrupt Chicago policemen without fear.
They were led by sergeant Ronald Watts.
The residents accused him and his tactical group of property abuses, police reports and imprisonment counterfeiting and violence.
Willie Martin and Cleon Glover are two of those convictioned by Kim Foxx, Prosecutor General of the County.
“If you didn’t work with him, you did not work well.
You were his enemy.
You have prevented him from working and profiting", Cleon Glover said about Watts.
“I was so afraid.
I wanted to escape from that district,
but I didn't have to go where," said Willie Martin.
The lawyers of the Foxx Ethics Department shall review further 30-40 Watts cases.
Ida Wells' social housing resident Landon Allen said that many people decided not to silence Watts.
“How much did he feel,” he said.
"But it wasn't important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed the people's words about the sergeant in official positions.
“He has his gang.
Who will believe us?"
Said Bucker.
Joshua Tepfer, working at the prosecution project at the University of Chicago, says that no one has actually believed in them until now.
“The whole thing went on, because they didn’t seem to be important or concerned, because they were black men living in social housing, so they were thought they were still offended,” Tepfers said.
‘Sergent Wattsas sat in prison for 22 months in 2013 for attempting to protect the FBI informant.
Martez Wise is also placed in prison thanks to Watts.
I was just born a son.
I couldn't be with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to reconnect with him," said Wise.
"I lost four years without need."
72 years old Fidelity believes in the success of block chains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of Fidelity block chains was noticed before 2018 when all corporations started talking about this technology.
Director-General Abby Johnson has managed investments in cryptovalyt, the most risky and volatile asset class in recent years.
“It was about two years ago that I and the other senior leaders were just curious about what is happening, especially in the bitcoins market,” said Johnson.
We started to talk and we realized that we had to find out.
The curiosity led to the start of the bitcoins in the New Hampshire unit, when the price of this cryptopolite was about $ 180.
Last December, the price was almost $20,000 and, according to Johnson, “we were surprised that when the price increased, we started to earn, although we never expected it. ”
It did not indicate how many bitcoins were "fiscal" or how much they earned "Fidelity".
Fidelity employees are clearly interested in these technologies.
The staff block chain club, called “Bits and Blocks”, which organises seminars and meetings with specialists, now has about 2 600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which gave Fidelity clients the opportunity to check the balance of cryptolates using Fidelity mobile app.
In 2015, it was made possible to donate funds by bitcoins.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins or refused them for at least a short time.
We are trying to monitor the market.
So far Katie Chase, the main Strateget of Fidelity Application Technology Centre and the Head of the FCAT Block Chain Incubator, are looking for ways to use public and business-based block chains.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but revealed that it had great interest in customers, partners and employees.
“There is a very new one.
If you learn information, you will understand that there is still an attempt to find evidence of the concept," Chase said.
We have tried to adapt block chains to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is not so advanced to solve such problems."
At present, the group focuses more on attempts to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They are trying to understand how to calculate the value of physical items such as works of art, in getons or to use block chains in the supply chain.
“However this is not the focus, but I think it will finally be interested,” said Chase.
Fidelity will be ready for this."
As an example, she indicated the “Pebble”, which was completely unsuccessful in marketing standards, but finally bought “Fidelity”.
Its group has developed a program for a smart watch, which is stopped after three years, when millions of millions have been collected through Kickstarter's pooled funding project.
When Apple Watch appeared on the market, Fidelity was ready.
It quickly applied the Pebble app to the new Apple product.
“We were not blind to believe that the “Pebble” clock was popular, but we wanted to be prepared if people enjoyed smart clocks,” she said.
"We gathered knowledge and were ready when smart clocks were released to the mass market."
Landquakes and tsunami damaged the island of Sovereign
On Friday 29 September, the island of Indonesia, Sulavesi, was hit by a powerful earthquake of 7.5 points, causing a tsunami and killing nearly 400 people.
There are many injured people, and the number of dead is expected to grow.
According to a representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, electricity and communication are not working, and therefore it is difficult to assess the damage to Palu in the city and the neighbouring Dangal fishing community.
The students of California weared shirts with racist writings
According to the KGTV branch of the CNN, the Union of Eskondid Schools this week confirmed that about 10 students had made a wrong decision to demonstrate racism at a classroom event.
“We are proud that all in our school are accepted and that there is no fear of diversity,” said Adriana Lepe-Ramirez, director.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and exclusion."
The report also states that the incident is being investigated by Eskondid's secondary school, Union officials and local police.
“School administrators have contacted the parents and caregivers of offenders and disciplinary sanctions will be imposed,” states the report.
According to a report from the police station, students from San Diego in the north of the school used picnic shirts with letters from which the racist record was made, and were photographed by wearing them.
The school usually confirms the notes in advance, but some students choose their own words after photographing the official picture.
The Union's report states that such behaviour is ‘not compatible with the culture, values or history of Escondid's secondary school’.
“We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day,” said Lepe-Ramirez.
"The primary school of Escondido will continue to promote a culture based on family values and unity throughout the community."
Former student Cade Pannell said to the KGTV that the social media saw an injurious photograph of him.
"It's personally offended," he said.
“It may have seemed funny for them, but that is not the case.
Only insane people can laugh from such things."

Senior son of Sarah Palin is accused of violence against his father
In 28, Track Palino was arrested for three offences, including the attack.
On Sunday, he was not first arrested for domestic violence.
According to the records of the court, the incident occurred in Palina's home in Vassila, Alaska, where Track Palinas was injured to blood by his father, Todd, in dispute with his truck.
The 28th year after the Saturday incident was arrested for three offences, including the attack.
The court documents state that the dispute began when the man called to take the truck, but the father refused to give it.
As explained in the court statement, Track Palinas was arrested for the first degree of harassment and the fourth degree of attack and the fourth degree of criminal offence, and his father was injured in his face and head.
According to the documents, Palinas named ‘small’ police officers who speak him and commanded no use of weapons.
The court’s statement also states that the man was knocked on the roof of the garage before being arrested.
In the court documents, Sarah Palin said that her son was “continued” and “used some medicines”.
It was also recorded that Track Palinas told the police that he had previously taken several bottles of beer.
He was arrested at the beginning of 2016 and was accused of domestic violence against a woman by impeding the reporting of domestic violence and arms abuse.
“Maying how my son feels what he is experiencing after returning, I understand other families who are experiencing the consequences of post-traumatic stress disorder, and I know how injured soldiers return,” then said the former candidate for the Republicans to Vice President and the Governor of Alaska.
"I understand now better than ever that the best Americans need the chief commander, who will respect them and appreciate them."
Elizabetha Warren argues that he was thinking about the election of Presidents after the mid-term elections
“The time for women to marry to Washington and correct the defective government, which must lead the woman,” said a democratic senator, speaking the masses who gathered at the city of Massachusetts in Holjoko jewelry.
"I promise this: after 6 November, think well whether it is not appropriate to stand up for Presidents."
Warren, trying to defend his position in competitions with the Republican representative in the state of Geoff Diehl, said earlier that the Presidents would not be tortured because he wanted to pay attention to the work in Senate.
“It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and to stop acting as the only important thing would be 2020,” she said to the rapporteurs in August by speaking in the National Press Club.
"The closest important fight is the mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also throughout the country."
Warren has long been seen as a potential candidate for democracy in 2020, capable of competing with President Donald Trump.
However, they would expect a difficult fight for the primary elections, which may involve other well-known democrats – former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, Senator of New York.
3rd mysterious death in less than a year with the Clinic of Psychiatric Health
According to The Mail, a third person has already committed suicide in the luxury clinic of psychiatry for a year.
The daughter of the television commission Shaquelle Vidal (23), died on April 7, almost a month later, when he voluntarily spent in West London, Marylebone, a hospital in Nightingale.
Her boy James Lyle (57 years) – the risk insurance fund manager, the millionaire and the former supporter of the Conservative Party – paid its maintenance costs for five years.
The future chief cook died almost six months after the day when the celebrity of the highland Daisy Boyd (28 years) was lost – one of the founders of River Cafe Rose Gray.
D. Boyd died after his divorce with the successor of the publishing company Dan Macmillan (43), who was suffering from the death of the clinic visitor who died on 5 October after the improper introduction of cocaine.
Two months ago, the artist Alan MacDonald (61), who left the hospital on the last four days, left his life.
In May, the Monitoring Quality Commission criticised the Nightingale Clinic as it did not sufficiently to prevent the infested illegal substances.
Avos Vidal’s daughter, Shaquelle, registered in the “Mock The Week” BBC program on 11 March.
Last week, at the previous meeting of the coronary court in Westminster, the Royal Advocate Katie Gollop stated that on 29 March Shaquelle disappeared from AWOL and returned to a deteriorated mental condition after a week.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Avos Vidal, said: “My client wants to find out what happened to Shaquelle..., what she was dealing with and what she did.”
Mr. Lyle, she called Shaquelle "a boy".
The informal father of Shaquelle, John Gordillo (52), called Comedia director, said: “I knew that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at that time. ”
During the Gordillo meeting, Shaquelle called him on April 4 and told him that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and he called the clinic more than a little more than a few times after this call, but nobody responded.
“I think it was possible to avoid further events if someone had responded,” he added.
On 5 April, the doctor found that Shaquelle had a very poor mental condition."
After less than 48 hours, she changed the runner's wire.
The representative of Nightingale expressed compassion for the family and friends and said: “Our clinic aims to provide high quality care in a safe, treatment-friendly environment.”

The U.S. Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the hit from the group’s ‘Spirit’ music.

Police traps in Michigan ended when the policeman moved to them a suspect murderer
The suspect resident of Michigan was arrested after the police traps, which ended with the police car.
It is suspected that in 33 C.E., Adams Nolinas shot her girl – 27 C.E. Tia Mae Randall – in Michigan City, Vajominge.
He was brought to court on Friday in a hospital where he arrived when he traveled by a police SUV car, because Nolin was shooting to police by trying to escape on a motorway where there was an intensive traffic.
Nolin was accused of five serious crimes, including attacks to kill and flee from the police.
“Punishment in hospital is not normal, but it is not the first such case,” said James Maguffee, the captain of the Vajoming police.
"It is subject to appropriate treatment, but the justice process must also continue.
The judges are often adapting so that this can be implemented."
The body of the Nolino girl was found on Thursday in the mobile area "Creekside Estates".
Two children's mother was shot with one shot and the police immediately found Nolin as a suspect.
Then the police issued a public warning about Nolin and presented a brief description of the man and his 1996 black Dodge pitch.
The man was observed in his piano and went to the motorway in US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and picpape hit the concrete wall, then departed from the car and knocked off the motorway.
When he fought at the involuntary policemen.
One policeman sat in the police's SUV car and moved Nolin from the back.
The observer filmed the event.
Noline is transported to a hospital with severe, but stable conditions, and will remain there until it is written out and moved to the prison in Kenth County.
“This event has shown that Western Michigan policemen risk their health in order to protect the community,” said Maguffee.
"They were arrested by men rather quickly and with appropriate means, and we are proud of them."
In total, he was accused of two accusations against the killing, and he was also accused of fleeing from the police, carrying a hidden gun and committing a serious crime through the use of a firearm.
He's not yet accused of killing his girlfriend because he's still under investigation.
“Of course, we are still carrying out a murder investigation, which we will soon conclude, so that we can submit to the prosecutor of Kenth County in due time,” said Maguffee.
The judge praised a courageous man, who was thrown into his house for a thief invaded
The judge did not regret the greatest praise for the courage of the man who stood against two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one hacker tried to bow his wooden board, David Oldham was not afraid in 63 C.E.
A man working as a guardian of the university territory defended, hit the two criminals and crashed one of their teeth.
The intruders ran away, but after the fighting on Mr. Oldham remained blood, according to which Craig Ford was detected and arrested after four months.
By admitting a judgment to Ford, who lost his teeth trying to get into the individual house of Oldham's 400 000 £ in Ormskerke, Lankashere, King Judge Clement Goldstone said: “You probably didn't expect such an Oldham's reaction – when you were busy to see only the eyes and nose, you encountered him at the house, he hit you.
He also hit your companion, who tried to break into the second floor and jumped from the roof.
On Friday, when the judge sentenced Ford to prison for three years and four months, he said: “I believe you have learned two lessons.
First, David Oldham does not need to be irritated, and second, it is better not to start with the police.
For your crimes now you have one teeth less than before and you have a dog bitter.
It's still a small penalty."
He added: “I want to praise Mr Oldham for how he responded to your actions.”
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that Ford, who committed the crime in 2016, was already sentenced for the next hack and had to be prisoned for three years, but was comparablely released.
Mr Oldham told the Royal Court of Liverpool when he heard the noise at home on 5 April about 19.00.
Mr. Jones said: “P. Oldham, who is a rich man, boldly went out of the house and resisted the accused.
When he was afraid of his security, he hit him in his face, thus hit him and thrown his teeth.
Then the next intruder shot from the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively hit him into his face."
According to Mr. Jones, the companion took a wooden board and tried to bow to Mr. Oldham, and Ford said: “Call him, he crashed my teeth. ”
The companion said to Mr Oldham: “If we go, we go out” and, together with Ford, flee from the place of the crime.
On 2 August, the police caught Ford in a house located in the region of Wavertree.
Ford blowed the police dog, then he blows him into his shoulder.
It is believed that the second breaker is still in freedom.
Ford, who has no permanent place of residence in 25 years, accused of hacking, confusing and dangerous driving, although this is prohibited and does not hold a driving licence.
The tower activists, Johnson, met the criticisms
The tower activists humiliated Boris Johnson today when he was called “a menu and aggressive man. ”
Mr Johnson, who tries to please the ordinary people in his uncompromising speeches about "Brexith", has received a strict assessment of the former Minister of Commerce, Digby Jones, which was accepted this afternoon by the participants of the Birmingham conference.
David Davis also attacked Mr Johnson because it is concerned with the titles of newspapers, not with strong policies.
When speaking with MailOnline, Mr. May, an alliance in the Cabinet of Ministers added that he simply "noise" because he was unable to be a full leader.
The opposition was received when the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs again attacked the plan of the Prime Minister Chequers and called him “intangible” and “very absurd”.
Mr Johnson also added that he has sincerely believed in the project, and that is where it did not support the withdrawal in the referendum that took place two years ago.
He also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as the construction of a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May recalled that her critics played political games and claimed that they did not bleach and were prepared for serious negotiations with the EU.
In an interview at Andrew Marro BBC, which started the tower conference, Mr. May said: “I believe in Brexitu.
Former Minister of Commerce of Leiborists Lord Jones, who is now independent, received the support of the crowd in praising the prospects of Brexito.
People expanded when he expressed their views on Mr Johnson, who allegedly responded to the questions of the concerned entrepreneurs.
Not specifically named Johnson, Lord Jones has enabled him to understand that he is “a man and aggressive man. ”
“Business is very important, so by saying “whole business”, the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs showed that there is indeed a small and aggressive man,” he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also praised his speech at the hall after the May response to the meeting of the leaders of Zalcburg heard the “trailers” of the EU leaders at its office plan.
Scottish Tower leader Ruth Davidson also criticised Mr Johnson in the past, reminding that he was a senior government officer in the negotiations on Brexit.
Mr. May Allied at the Cabinet of Ministers, MailOnline said that intervention is not very serious and Mr. Johnson has insufficient supporters among the tours in Parliament to be able to remove the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He is noiseing, but he does not have enough supporters in Parliament and knows that.
We see a clear contrast between David Davis, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, who meets his personal ambitions."
The business secretary Greg Clark criticised Mr Johnson, who attacked the sceptics of the businessmen looking at "Brexit".
While speaking at the Tower Conference in Birmingem, Mr Clark said that Mr Johnson was “very incorrect”.
He said: “I am surprised that someone can think so at all.
There is no successful economy in the world, which would not be successful for prosperous companies."
In an interview with Sky News, Ridge on Sunday, Mr. Davis acknowledged that the coming months will not be easy, as the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to provide many advantages.
However, he believes that the government must not give up and seek an agreement similar to that of the Canadian Treaty, rather than that proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
When asked how Mr Johnson succeeded in leading the towers, he did not miss the opportunity to save the former secretary for Foreign Affairs.
Said Mr Johnson’s suggestion to build a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: “One of the British policy weaknesses is policies with fantastic ideas.”
He added: “Our communication is chaotic and many of his ideas are suitable for headlines, but not for strong politics.”
Bulgaria spent 80 million £ European taxpayers' money for poor restoration
Bulgaria has spent 80 million dollars of European taxpayers' money for the poor restoration of ancient castles, which now look like built from "sul and cardboard".
The Balkan country spent $80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning to the former pride, the restoration received utility.
The local authorities of the areas next to the cruel cruise promised to revert unbelievable works.
The Bulgarian Government has spent tens of millions of EU unsolicited medieval castles for restoration.
The Balkan country spent $80 million from the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of ancient castles and fortresses, but instead of returning their former pride, it enjoyed trust in the construction work.
It looks like built from “shaped and cardboard” after a costly reconstruction, so it is no longer attractive for tourists.
For example, the monumental custodians were impressed by the custody of the Middle Ages of Pernica in the western Bulgarian city, Krakra and the Roman fort Trayanovi Vrata, alongside Ihtimano, were reconstructed using polymeric concrete, usually used to build the floor.
According to The Telegraph, the EU and the Bulgarian Government have agreed privately that this failure requires lessons.
“The strength is in an overwhelming state,” said architect and memorial protector Stella Duleva about Trayanovi Vrata.
She has held her 16 centuries, and now it is damaged."
As such reactions occurred after the restoration of Krakra fort in Pernika, the local authorities promised to remove the presented parts in 2019.
The pernice harness has been removed by "paper of cardboard" due to unbelievable modifications.
The Bizantijos Yailata fort was named “surface firm”, because it was rebuilt from fine white blocks that do not fit the air-affected fasad.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with the new doubts about how the European Union uses the development funds.

In the MG Baltic case, the accused were discussing Gabriel Landsberg
The hearing started a review of the interview (after November 2015) between former Vice President of MG Baltic, Raimondas Kurlianskis and former "worker" Vytautas Gapšis.
When listening to the record, it is difficult to understand exactly what those who are currently accusing are talking about.
It is true that the record hears that Mr Kurlianskis and Mr Gapšys are talking about Christmas celebration, and the name of the current conservative leader Gabriel Landsbergis sounds several times, but it is difficult to understand what exactly is said.
Prosecutions submitted to both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, the accusations were lodged with three legal and five natural persons: the Labour and Liberal Union parties, the MG Baltic Group, the former leaders of liberals and "workers" E. Masiulis, Vytautas Gapšis, the former parliamentarist of Liberal S. Gustainis, the Seimas Member of G. Steponavičius and former Vice-President of MG Baltic Kurlianskis.
Suspects have been submitted to the Labour Party regarding the effects of bribery and trade, the Liberals' conscience is suspected of bribery, trade and abuse, and MG Baltic suspects the effects of buying and trading of these parties.
Officials suspect that the politicians took or talked about bribes with MG Baltic Vice-President R. Kurlianski and later proposed or supported the Group-friendly initiatives in the Seimas and other institutions.
Former President of the Liberal Union E. Masiulis is suspected of the effects of trade, bribery and illegal enrichment, suspicion of abuse by former Vice-President Steponavit, former member of the Vilnius City Council, by bribery.
Mr Gapšys is suspected of the effects of bribery and trade, Mr Kurlianskis, of the effects of shopping and trade.
Survey: Who has the greatest chance to win in the second round of the presidential elections?
Four candidates at the top of the rankings were included in the survey on the second round of elections - economist Gitan Nausėda, unannounced Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis and two candidates attended in the initial elections of the Party of the Union of Paternity - Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) - Seimas Member Ingrida Simonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ušackas.
True, on Sunday, the support of the TS-LKD in the elections was received by I. Simonytė and V. Ušackas left the election fight.
According to data, if elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases Mr Nausėda would win on the second side of the President, but the leader of Vilmorus, sociologist Vlad will be waiting to say that it is too early to draw conclusions.
"Excludes (from the others - DELFI) Nau sitting, but it is very important to see whether the parties are talking about, or about people, what dynamics are.
These doubled the Symonite from one study to another, and Nausėda had stopped growth, and even the decrease in Ushack was.
This is very important for you," the sociologist says.
Moreover, looking at the results of the survey, it is clear that a significant percentage of people have not yet decided what they will vote for or intend not to vote in general.
If Mr Simonyte and Mr Skvernelis were to come together in the second election of the President, the fight would be tense - the vote would be 32.7% for I. Simonyte, the 30.9% for S. Skvernelis.
True, even 36.4% of people said that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or did not know who they would vote for, or would not vote for the elections.
The sociologist V. Gaidis once again stressed that we have not yet seen a full picture, because all candidates who would apply to less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet been published.
"If we look at the elections last year, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where was the candidate for social democrats? 30 years was the candidate, will it not now?
When you publish it, you will see how his opportunities are taking place with other candidates.
Thus, that half of Lithuania, which is less successful, is still less reflected," V. Will wait.
In turn, politologas Mazvydas Jastramskis, the Institute of International Relations and Policy Sciences (VU TSPMI), at Vilnius University, says that it is very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates who have rejected Ušack, who have left the fight, look approximate.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences do not mean anything.
The difference of 5 percentage points does not really show any advantage for any candidate.
The only thing I could see that Nau sitting would look well against Ushack (...) again, bearing in mind, if those people were actually voting.
Nau sitting before Skvernelis also looks good, but we compare now apples and potatoes, because, for example, Nausėda has already declared that he will participate, Skvernelis has not declared.
In addition, the survey was done before the initial elections of conservatives, as it would look after them?", says the politologist.
According to him, Mr Nausėda has a small plus, but when all candidates have already been announced, he can examine.
"The situation is quite uniform.
Nau sitting, Skvernelis, Shimonnyte - results around.
I would like to remind you that, half a year before the 2003 presidential elections, Roland Pax had a 5% support to vote for it and then won the elections.
It is not possible to do any predictions," Mr Jastramskis said.
DELFI recalls that there is already an economist G. Nausėda, Member of the Seimas I. Simonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Member of the Seimas Aušra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberals' Union Peter Auštrevičius, Member of the Seimas Naglis Puisis and Member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.

No personal money taken by the cheat will be returned to Massule
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal declared that it rejected the accused lawyer’s complaint.
The order shall be final and shall not be appealed against.
In the case of political corruption, the former Head of the Liberal Union E. Masiulis appealed to the Court of Appeal, asking him to repay some personal money - money taken from him and the money of the spouse through the chet.
A total of more than 242 thousand euros were taken from E. Massul.
Such money is subject to a temporary restriction of ownership and is permanently extended.
The Vilnius Regional Court last extended it on the 15th of October.
Mr Masiulis has not asked the Appeals Court to repay all the money - he seeks to recover from the spouse's money of EUR 800 and his money - EUR 690, GBP 130, USD 1600.
Former politicians say that the last money was devoted to the US planned trip.
At the sitting of the Appeal Court, Ms Massul’s lawyer Mindaugas Bliuvas asked for the reimbursement of these money on Monday, because the spouses had a well-paid job and had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justas Laucius asked the court to reject the complaint.
"The ruling of the Vilnius Regional Court is lawful and justified, there is no restriction on the assets specified in the accusations submitted.
The Court has rightly held that it constitutes a basis for confiscation of assets, as well as for an extended confiscation of assets", Mr Laucius said at the hearing.
On October 15, Vilnius Regional Court decided not to repay more than 242 thousand euros to the convicted political corruption case E. Masiulis.
These money was found through the crash of the accusation of corruption in the former politician's home and car.
The Chamber of three Judges stated that it was apparent from the file that ownership was limited to funds that constitute the subject matter of the criminal offences injured by E. Massul.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it should be concluded that the right of property of the accused is not limited disproportionately or that the restriction applies too long," states the order of judges Nijolė Žimkienė, Jurgita Kolyčiene ir Ugniaus Trumpulis.
The judges pointed out that Mr Masiulis was accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal proceedings were large and complex, and therefore it was necessary to extend the temporary restriction of property of the accused to ensure possible confiscation of assets and an extended confiscation of assets.
Prosecutors claim that former Vice-President of MG Baltic Group Raimondas Kurlianskis gave EUR 106 thousand to E. Masiuli for making decisions in the Seimas for the benefit of the Group.
Both accused persons believe that the money found at Mrs Masiulio - EUR 90 000 - was a loan from Mr Kurlianski.
According to the case, EUR 242.4 thousand was found at E. Masiulio, GBP 130, and USD 1.6 thousand.
Mr Masiulis and his lawyer have repeatedly tried to recover money, but their requests were rejected by the courts.
Former politicians have said that part of these funds belongs to other persons and have been dedicated to investing in real estate or being family money.
He also claimed that there is no evidence that funds would be obtained criminally.
Previously, the Court of Appeal has declared that the accusations made to Mr Massule show that these funds could have been obtained by receiving more than EUR 100 000.
The legal protection claims that the remaining cash taken through the crash could have been obtained from undetected sources of income, not declared, not documented and may not be legal.
In the political corruption case, the accusations were lodged with three legal persons - the Labour Party, the Liberal Union, the MG Baltic Group.
In addition to Mr Masiulio, in the case, the accusations were lodged with the former "worker" Vytautas Gapšis, the former liberal Charūnas Gustainis, member of the Seimas, Gintaras Steponavičius, and former Vice-President of MG Baltic, R. Kurlianskis.
Mr Kurlianskis is accused of giving the former parliamentarians E. Masiuli, S. Gustainis and V. Gapši.
Americans locked dangerous Russian fighter manoeuvres
At the time of the 25-minute takeover, the United States' naval forces said that Russian SU-27 rushed straight on the front of the plane.
The Russian plane flies through it for the second time, using a traction acceleration, and took a turn with a lever.
Passengers reported a feeling of turbulence during the first approach and a crash during the second approach.
Russian army has the right to exercise in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We look forward to international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that are in line with behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on the Prevention of incidents at sea and over sea (INCSEA), - the US Naval Forces said in their report.
"The unsafe actions increase the risk of miscalculation and possible collisions", the report notes.
The Ministry of Defence of Russia recognised the incident, but believed that Russian SU-27 kept a "safe distance" from the American aircraft.
Parental expenditure does not decrease further: only up to EUR 50 per month for non-classical activities
According to the survey of the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Research" at the end of August, the survey revealed that a third (32%) of parents paid less than 100 euros for the "purchasing" of their single school-age child before school this year, a fifth (21%) spent between 101 and 150 euros, three out of ten euros (29%) from 151 to 200 euros, and a less than a fifth (18%) of them spent more than 200 euros for school training at the end of the summer.
Parents whose children began to go to the first class in this school year have spent about 220 euros on the average for their child's school basket, while other parents whose children have already completed the first class have allocated a lower amount - about 160 euros on the average for their child's training.
However, the costs are not reduced as the academic year goes into, as parents often have to spread the money to children's teams and chorepetitors.
Depending on the nature of the occupation, the price of one team in the country may vary from 20 to 100 euros.
Parents who have school-age children were asked to tell them what average amount per month they intend to allocate to their single child's out-of-court employment.
A quarter (23%) of the interviewed child's post-school activities planned to be up to EUR 20 per month, a quarter (26%) claimed to have paid up to EUR 50, three out of ten (31%) devoted between EUR 50 and 100 per month, and a sixth (17%) of parents stated that they were planning to spend EUR 100 or more.
It is true that children of school age in Lithuania are awarded a basket of non-formal education of children, amounting to EUR 15 per month.
However, these money can only be used for one unit, and if the transaction price is higher, the difference must be borne by the parents.
In the event that a child visits several teams or a family grows several children of school age, post-school expenses may double.
Justina Ambrasienė, marketing manager of the consumer loan company "Vivus.lt", says that saving children's families with low or medium incomes, especially when several children grow in the family, can become a major challenge.
After the beginning of the academic year, parents rotated their heads, from which to get money for exercises, clerical goods or new sporting clothing.
Now the main concern is how to occupy children after school without spending some money.
We note that parental spending is particularly increasing in August when it is necessary to properly prepare for the new scientific year, but then it remains higher than in the summer period, because parents tend to invest in their offspring's employment.
They are often determined and borrowed when they have lacked funds and evaluated their opportunities in a responsible manner," says Mr Ambrasienė.

The fourth troleibuse that has already been stirred is happy for the Kaunas
Today, the fourth exhibition "At Age, Good News" of mobile streets has been released to Kaunas streets - the old troleibuse, which is engraved by drawing and signing "Sienagraphio užrašai".
The city municipality of Kaunas has reported a new folding trolleybus.
"This grandmother "Škoda" has also replaced her little boasting green color into a much more colorful and brighter clothe.
She is also a participant in the exhibition "Atta old, good news!", - writes representatives of the municipality at the uploaded photo.
Mobile street art exhibition "At the oldest, good news" is designed to say goodbye to the old troleibuses, which will be replaced for the next year.
Already next year, the old "Škoda" troleibuses will travel for a paid rest, they will be replaced by 85 newcomers and modern Solaris troleibuses.
The portal recalls that the first troleibuse, drawn by street drawings, went to Kaunas streets a month ago.
On the troleibuse there are several well-known Kaunas street art accents - grandfather's piping and elephant.
Not later than a week after the first visit to Kaunas streets, the second work of the street artist Timomtie Norvila - Morf.
A fun yellow car on the troleibus is displayed, which is often referred to as "wabal".
"I wanted to put the trolleybus in place.
This image looks very fun, especially because it also corresponds to the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels rotate on the turn, it seems to be part of that car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them like a retro-style, it was a great call for the whole combination.
Until the troleibuse tyres were painted, it was certainly not so fascinating," the street artist spoke to the portal in the past.day.lt.
And on October 27, the impressive picture also lay on the third troleibuse.
It is immersed in white, yellow, orange, brown, but mostly in blue.
This color is dominating.

Over the years, seeing how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means not a regular shopping, but a tradition to give time to yourself.
It often becomes a place for friends’ meetings and a reason to spend a day with a sister or mother.
The four days of the exhibition have a special power - each woman here can learn charming secrets, learn tricks as to how to look blooming every day, find irreplaceable products, hear or test various procedures that stop the skin ageing process.
All this is more, it promises even 415 participants of the exhibition, who are waiting for visitors on all three floors of the Arena.
For three days, seminars on beauty and health topics will be held, and on Sunday, the representatives of the beautiful sex will be able to hear tips for a unique image to create from style and blogger Viktorija Šaulytė lips.
A large proportion of women turning into a business face marginal situations when stress starts to hamper a stable emotional and physical state.

Prime Minister: After the introduction of ethics payment, teachers' salary increased by 117 EUR
Since September, following the introduction of the ethics pay model, the wages of the educators of the country with the average full load have increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
"It's very early to say how much it (newly - BNS) has advantages or disadvantages.
The fact is that those people who have a full workload - their wages have increased by more than 117 euros on average", S. Skvernelis said to journalists in the Government on Monday.
He referred to the plans of the Lithuanian Educational Workers' Trade Union (LŠDPS) to exercise a strike on ethical payment as a "democratic right", but emphasised that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"In a democratic country, all forms of protest are permitted, possible.
If it is thought that a strike is needed, it is their right of decision.
Only again would you not want children, schoolchildren, to suffer in this place.
If there is a strike, this must be done in accordance with the laws in force," Mrs Skvernel said.
In June, the Seimas approved the model of payment of ethics teachers' work, which has been introduced in stages since September.
The teacher’s payout was replaced by an hourly pay - the teacher’s post is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three parts: contact hours, training, preparation for them and work for the community.
The trade union led by Andriaus Navick calls this reform absurd, disgustingly adopted the "buldozer" principle and proclaims an indefinite strike on the 12th of November.
The LCA requires that this 'minute' pay system be immediately abandoned and an ethical model is put in place, with a maximum number of 18 contact hours per post.
Also, the weightings of the permanent share of the salary should be increased by 20% and the number of children in the classes reduced.
Among other innovations, the new methodology for allocating training funds is criticised because, according to the trade union, it is not enough to divide funds for home training, classes into groups, qualifications, education aid, and classes in large cities, as has remained overfilled.
The Ministry of Education and Science stated that the ethical pay of teachers will help to adjust the workloads of teachers and reward all the work of the school community.
It is foreseen that the work of the teacher's post will be open to the community up to half of the total number of hours per year, up to 40% of all hours in the first two years of work.
The working time of teachers shall be set at 36 hours per week, of which not more than 24 contact points per week for the compulsory training of the subject(s).
In May, about half a hundred general education schools, nurseries and non-formal education institutions, about 1 thousand teachers contributed to the two-hour strike initiated by the LSDS.
In total there are around 53 thousand teachers in Lithuania.
Encourages to be prepared: the crisis can be expected in 2-3 years
The slowdown of economic growth and even the crisis can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than in the past decade, in the interview "Knowledge Radio" broadcasts "Business position" said Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
"I would certainly not be able to say that the crisis is behind the corner, but the signs of economic slowdown are indeed.
This year our country's economy has grown by more than 3 percent, and next year we are planning 2.8 percent growth.
The key message I would like to say to the public and business - let us be ready for everything," Mr Vasiliauskas said.
He believes that there are no uniform crises, and that is why they also need different preparation.
The differentiation from the crisis in the decade ago is that at that time the government thought that the income generated by the growing economy would be everlasting and that this was the estimated cost.
As a result, after the crisis in 2008, expenditure has been drastically reduced.
Now, according to Mr Vasiliausko, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"Only, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance differs.
We believe that we have already exceeded our potential and that brakes need to be pressed.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance does not think so," said the Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
Vasiliauskas assesses the preparations of the country's institutions for the coming crisis by 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, such a small and open economy as Lithuania has a great impact on external factors.
The current push of the big elephants - the United States, China, the European Union - will undoubtedly touch us.
We must therefore be very careful.
If there is little economy to say that we are dealing with everything, it is possible, but I do not believe it," Mr Vasiliauskas said.
What can we expect for those who took large loans in the future?
According to Mrs Vasiliauskas, the European Central Bank has clearly set up a short-term strategy, and decisions on interest developments can be expected not earlier than the summer of the following year: 'At this moment, the main objective is to try to manage expectations'.
The trend, which is the most worrying to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is a decline in the working hands of our country.
"The decline in working hand is also a significant factor in the decline in economic competitiveness.
It is also a decline in bread mealers.
Migration has allowed a bit to balance this process this year, but it does not know whether this is a long-term trend," says my Vasiliauskas.
ELTA recalls that the Bank of Lithuania and the Ministry of Finance predict that the economy of the country will grow by 3.4% this year and 2.8% next year.
Swedish Conservative leader will try to form a government again
The Swedish leader of a conservative Balanced Party, who has been in a political clash for two months after the elections, will receive a second opportunity to form a government, announced on Monday by the President of the Parliament.
The Balanced Party of Ulf Kristerson belongs to the Alliance of four centre right parties, which received slightly less votes during the 9th of September elections than the former Left Coalition of the Governing Centre.
It was difficult for both blocks to put together a majority when they refused to agree with the anti-immunicist party of the Swedish Democrats, whose origins are in the neonatic movement.
The first attempt by Mr Kristersson to form a government on 14 October was unsuccessful.
On October 29, the unsuccessful test was announced by the Prime Minister, Stefan Lioven, who concluded the term of office.
In an attempt to make the parties agree, the President of Parliament, Andreas Norlen, said that Mr Kristersson would propose to Parliament next week as a candidate for the Prime Minister, thus pushing the first vote since the beginning of government-building efforts.
"In advance, it is not clear whether the various parties will accept Ulph Kristersson as a Prime Minister," A. Norlen said to journalists.
However, he stressed that 'the process must move forward and the dynamics between parties must change'.
"The fruitless negotiations have to end," he added.
The date of Parliament's vote is still unclear, but Mr Norlen said that there is 14 November between possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of Parliament may delegate four times to any candidate to form a government that the parliament would agree.
If all four tests are unsuccessful, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr Kristersson is the third test of Mr Norlen.
Some Groups of Christian Democrats from the Balanced Party and the Alliance's Partners are pressing U. Kristersson to accept the support of the extreme right-wing party in Sweden, but he has so far rejected this possibility.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which has received 17.6% of the votes in the elections and is the third largest party, is ignoring all the mainstream parties for a long time.
The Ultradesch party, who has successfully used during the elections the evil of the voters on immigration after almost 400 000 asylum seekers arrived in the country since 2012, calls for influence in the decision-making process in exchange for support.
However, the members of the Alliance are categorically opposed to this idea by liberals and centralists.
From 2014 onwards, the Swedish Social Democratic Labour Party (SAP), which has managed with the Green and Informal Left, has made it possible to cooperate between the blocks, but only if it holds the Prime Minister's post.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
The Afghan Government Delegation will participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The Kabul Government delegation will participate in the international negotiations on peace war in drastic Afghanistan held in Russia this month, the officials announced on Monday.
In turn, the Taliban continues to consider whether to participate.
Russia announced on Saturday that it would hold such a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently trying to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the 17-year end of the conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Afghan Government, responsible for the efforts of reconciliation with the fighters, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, and the AFP told the representative of Sayedas Ihsanas Taheri (Sajidas Ihsanas Taheris).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan avoided to answer whether it would send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on initiating peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still negotiating with Russian officials, - said the representative of Sebaghtullah Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - Congratulations to any peace effort under the afghan leadership.
Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahide (Zabiula Mudžahide) said that movement is still considering whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the USA, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and the five former Soviet Central Asian Republics.
Pakistan, long accused of supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan, "usually participated", AFP said a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisal (Muhamada Faisal).
The US Embassy in Kabule has not yet responded to the request to comment.
The meeting in Moscow was planned initially in September, but was postponed by Kabul requesting Afghanistan to lead the process.
Negotiations will take place at a time of urgency.
Newly appointed U.S. Peace Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad (Zalmay Chalilzad) tries to convince the Taliban to agree to the conclusion of the war and to fear that the multilateral meeting in Russia could destroy these efforts.
One US government supervisory authority pointed out last week that the government of Kabul in Afghanistan has weakened in recent months.
Cuban President in Pyongyang met the leader of North Korea
The North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas and Cuban President Miguel Diaza-Canel, who both hope to abolish US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen their strategic relations on Monday by the North Korean public media.
Mr Diaz-Canel, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip after his arrival in April, fled to Pyongyang and his wife on Sunday.
Kim Jong Unas met him at the airport, and the leaders came together to the city through the people who welcomed them.
The North Korean public media reported that the leaders had held negotiations in the public guest house "Paekhwawon", highlighting the overall socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide many details, but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The meeting with Kim Jong Un could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress on denuclearisation in North Korea are increasingly stringing.
Pyongyang, which has also been in favour of Moscow in recent times, tightens the rhetorics before the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Maic Pompey) and the Central Korean Negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) meeting in New York, planned this week.
At the weekend, Pyongyang criticised the US in its official media for irrevocable sanctions, a political tool that Washington has also widely used against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea referred to the possibility of further development of the nuclear programme if Washington did not change the course.
Sanctions are an important issue on the Diaz-Canel agenda.
Last week, when visiting Moscow, Diaz-Canel discussed the arms treaty of almost $50 million (€43.8 million) with Russia and received a similar promise from Vladimir Putin to expand political, economic and military relations.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the US's 'internal affairs of sovereign states'.
The US economic embargo for Cuba, initially introduced in 1958 and subsequently extended, remains valid.
The brutal sanctions against Russia in the US and the European Union were imposed on Crimean anexication and support for separatists in Eastern Ukraine.
Diaz-Canel must leave Pyongyang on Tuesday.
He will also visit China, Vietnam and Laos.

I. Valinskienė: for my children, I would be able to deal with a lot of things
In the opera of the new building rock, the ranks of the most famous artists in the country will expand in "Love and Death in Verona".
Inga Valinskienė is connected to the team of artists, which is entrusted with one of the most important roles of the work - a known woman will play the Yuljeta aukle.
Povilas Meškėla, who will take care of the singing of artists, also became an important part of the team.
"I think love stories have been created in many and very beautiful times since Shakespeare, but "Romeo and Juliet", obviously will always remain a symbol of these stories and will be built in various scenes for a long time.
It will be interesting to become part of one of these buildings," Mr Valinskienė says about the new test that had collapsed on shoulders.
Although a known woman is well acquainted with the scene, has created a number of roles in various performances or musicals, she has not yet been able to play.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed," I. Valinskienė smiles.
- I'd probably like to have accepted such a proposal in my time."
True, the character of the cuisine is not less important in the drama of W. Shakespeare, and some critics are even considered the most important.
The sacrifice is not only a mediator, an auxiliary - its way and the tone of speech, the women's attitude to feels and the resulting solidarity with lovers gives a lot more and different colors to the sigh.
In addition, it is also important because she is one of the only two women in the print "Romeo and Juliet".
"Autumn character for my way and style is not very close, but sometimes only interesting.
Create a different character than has its own, a fun part of the creative process.
I do not know what the final result will be, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the interpretation of the director," says Mr Valinskienė and reveals that being in the position of the Juliet's aukle, it is likely that this would be the case.
- I think she listened to her heart.
This is what most women do.
I would probably do this too."
The legendary Kęstutis Antanelis rock opera "Love and Death in Verona" is created by the famous W. Shakespeare drama "Romeo and Juliet".
Real fact-based work tells us the tragically ending history of love between two young people - Rome and Juliet.
The sad end of history is due to the uncertainties of the conflict between young people's families - Montek and Capulets.
"All history is possible in all times.
Parents who were against the choice of children have always been and will be.
Only today's solutions to such problems - more diversely - are asked whether the history of Romeo and Juliet can recur today, says the future vulgar I. Valinskienė.
- In my own name, I would be able to cope with a lot of my children, as well as with the lady."
Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justinas Jarutis will perform the main role of the rock opera that is played by Ramūnas Cicėnas, Romeo and Julieta, and also Vidas Bareikis, Kęstutis Cicėnas, Mindaugas Papinigis, Marius Jampolskis, Paul Šinkūnas and Aidas Barkauskas will appear in the scene.

"Skamp" presents a song whose video has already refused to display one TV
This year and again, the group "Skamp" started to create music intensively.
After publishing the only jubilee concert "Skamp20" to be held in Vilnius Siemens Arena on 26 December, a three-step presents new works afterwards.
This time - it's a "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a brave song video.
"This piece is about love, so I thought that all kinds of relationship, regardless of age or sexual orientation, should be embodied in the clip," the idea of a new song and video reveals Erica Jennings, which is convinced that any expression of homophobia in 2018 is not normal.
The new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" has filmed in the video over ten different directions and age pairs: "We have always supported LGBTQIA communities and believe that one day we will no longer need to discuss this," says Viktor Diawara, who created the music of the work at the beginning of the year during the family holiday in Israel.
True, this video clip has already led to negative reactions - he did not want to show one of the most popular broadcasts in the country.
This tells us a lot about our society.
TV will not show a clip because it kisses people, and it's not an inappropriate content for children.
And the fact that the television can be applied on the screen at any time of the day, and the examples of other violence are the right content?" - E. Jennings asks rhetorically.
The Erics also admit Willius Alesius: "I would like to see more people around, regardless of their social situation, sex or age, who have come into contact and kissed.
We grow children and want them to grow in an environment with as much tolerance as possible and less confidence as possible.
A new song and video we want to make a little clear on the day of our listeners and give them a smile."
Since 1998, the Skamp group has been famous for the brave texts of songs that have spoken on non-popular or sensitive topics.
The best songs of all groups - old and new - will sound loudly and widely at the Skamp20 concert on December 26 in Vilnius Siemens Arena.
Everyone with his families is waiting for it, and children under 10 years of age are free of access.

Presidency: LRT is not political property
When the Seimas intends to return to the discussion of the conclusions of the Commission that examined the activities of the LRT, the Presidency fears that the rulers simply seek to acquire more political control over the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politicians, and the fundamental principle is to maintain that independence from politicians," Ms Mindaugas Lingė explained to the Knowledge Radio.
However, the advisor emphasised that the opposite process can now be seen.
"It is possible to see that the influence of these (political. - ELTA) is desirable to have more.
That is what we appreciate quite critically," Mrs Linge said.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission operating in the Seimas are questionable and questionable because they apply to the independence of the broadcaster.
While, Mr Linge stressed the need to improve the management of LRT, this should be done on the basis of expert assistance and with specific aspects that impede the smooth operation of LRT.
He stressed that the international institutions have already stressed that the LRT should be supervised by the competent authorities, not by political authorities.
On Tuesday, the Seimas intends to take a decision on the conclusions of the Commission that examined the activities of the LRT.
These conclusions have been subject to many criticisms.
The proposals to change the management of the LRT are very sceptical: to reduce the powers of the Council and to link its members to the term of office of the appointing authorities.
In this context, the European Broadcasting Union expressed its concerns.
In January, the opposition group of members of the Seimas appealed to the Constitutional Court as to whether the special parliamentary commission investigating the activities and finances of the LRT was inconsistent with the Constitution.
Workers abroad - good news from R. Karbauskio
The Seimas started to consider the amendment of the Law on the Declaration of Residence, submitted by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the Senior of the Group of Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union, whereby citizens who work and pay taxes outside Lithuania would be exempt from the compulsory health insurance contributions.
Following the submission, 56 Seimas members supported the project on Tuesday, and nine had abstained from 25 parliamentarians.
After reading in committees, the draft is planned to be discussed at the Seimas plenary session on 6 December. The Seimas also decided to request the Government's conclusion.
According to the proposed project, persons who pay social security contributions in the Member States of the European Union, in the States of the European Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation shall be exempted from the compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania by decision of the Authority of the State Social Insurance Fund.
residing and operating outside Lithuania, according to the procedures laid down by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund (Sodra) and the State Tax Inspectorate, should be considered as having left Lithuania.
This is about the services that a person does not use.
There is an additional opportunity to fix the fact that a man has left," Mr. Karbauskis explained from the Tribune of the Seimas.
Such proposed legal regulation would, according to Antanas Matulas, be unfair to citizens living in Lithuania and paying taxes.
"Dals of Lithuanians living abroad abuse it," observed A. Matulas.
Social democrat Algirdas Sysas believes that in this way we call on citizens to refrain from complying with their obligations.
In his view, it would provide preconditions for the use of the health system free of charge.
Upon the adoption of the proposed amendments to the law, the social security contributions to persons who have left to other countries will be paid there, the debts will not be accrued, the burden of the administration of Sodra debts will be made easier.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared in accordance with the procedure laid down by legal acts in the Register of Residents of departure shall be charged monthly compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions and, if they are not paid, the debt shall accumulate.
A. Breadla has been convicted of fraud but has been convicted of counterfeiting
Vilnius Regional Court has left the sentence for attempting to fraud with Alvyd Duonalai, a former famous athlete, but he has been justified because of the counterfeiting of documents.
On Monday, the verdict of the court entered into force immediately.
A. Bonela has been sentenced to the detention of liberty for a period of half four years, the execution of the sentence being postponed.
This year, the Vilnius City District Court convicted the multiple champion of Lithuanian riots.
He was sentenced to a sentence for half four years of imprisonment.
The court of Vilnius Regional Court examined the case under the conviction of the conviction, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay almost EUR 760 to the crime victims fund.
Prosecutor A. Duonėl was accused of deceiving in 2013 that he lent 200 thousand litas (about 58 euros) to the dental office of his former wife Dalia Burokaitė.
The spouse learned about this only in December 2016 when she received calls for debt.
The former spouse told the man that he had never occupied the money for the clinic and had never signed the bill.
According to the judges of Vilnius Regional Court, there is no objective data in the case that A. Duonėla would have recorded data that do not correspond to reality, that it is not the debt of UAB "Dalecija" to A. Duonėlai 200 thousand LTL.
The arguments put forward by the convict and his defendant in the complaint are acceptable and there is no objective evidence in the case.
In this way, after finding that A. Duonėla used only the false true document for fraud and recognising that this attribute - the use of the fraudulent document - is an integral part of fraud (in the case under consideration - the attempt to fraud), Mr. Duonėla is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code, without proof that he was involved in committing a criminal offence", says the judgement of the Vilnius Regional Court.
The fires led the cats on earth - three days heard the snatch.
According to the Kaunas County Fire Rescue Board, a report has been received that a cat poured for three days after the change of the thermal pipelines.
After the fires arrived, they also heard the cottage of the cat.
It was clear that a few days ago there were repairs of the thermal track.
It is guessed that two cats could have been shut down on the ground when the trajectory was closed.
The fires discovered the heat trail cover at a depth of one and a half feet [2 m] and shed the cavity of cats out there.
The son of Antonino Scalia claims that his father would not be surprised by the liberal protests on Kavanaugh’s
The son of Velnis Supreme Court judge Antoninas Scalia said to Fox News on Sunday that his father would not surprise the protest of extreme forces against the nominated judge Brettas Kavanaugh, because Scalia thought that the Supreme Court was too interfering with the affairs of the modern world.
"Together, it would not be very surprised by the noise of the nomination to the Supreme Court, because many are based on the Roe v Wade case – at least that is said by the left," said Christopher Scalia, reminding of the remarkable 1973 case, which enshrined the constitutional right of women to abortion during certain trimesters.
The Roe case, in one particular, abolished the right of all states to regulate abortion themselves, and some states, in response to this decision, have immediately tried to limit the right to abortion.
“My father often said that the Roe v Wade and other cases actually tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be solved through elections and legislative process,” he added during the exhibition in Fox & Friends."
"In trying to speed up the procedure, the Supreme Court has caused even more damage, and therefore nominations to the Supreme Court and disputes on the approval result in a more serious reaction, because judges take the role of legislators."
The Senator of Nebraska, the Republic of Ben Sasse, expressed a similar opinion in the meeting this month on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that the Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, which are basically not accountable to anyone, and which leaves red tape to the Supreme Court, so judges must take the job which the Senators refuse.
The police of the Capitol hill arrested and accused hundreds of protesters for the illegal intervention of the candidate's approval process.
When Scalia asked whether Kavanaugh could avoid a hostile reaction to the unconfirmed suspicion of sexual misconduct he had committed several decades ago, it was said that it would probably not be possible to avoid noise.
In response to the statements that Kavanaugh should not be appointed to the Supreme Court because on Thursday, during the senators' survey, Scalia responded hotly and sometimes immorally, Scalia questioned whether all judges were a calm character.
"The judges often angry," Scalia said about the evil disputes that sometimes arise in controversial cases.
“Truth, judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but this was a different context.
He tried to defend his good name against unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, in the Committee on the Courts of the Senate, the majority of the parties (11 against 10) were allowed to participate in the vote of the entire Senate.
The Senator of the Republic of Arizona Jeff Flake stated a dramatic moment that he would give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh only if the FBI would be given a week for investigations on the current alleged infringement of the accusations brought to Kavanaugh.
The investigation is still ongoing and President Trumpas said that the agency was given a wide range of powers and that it was able to interview “who would just like”.
“Schiaparelli” in a collection of prepared clothes – fantastic finishes
Is Surrealism possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris Fashion House, which Elsa Schiaparelli founded almost a hundred years ago, presented its first collection of ready clothes and handicrafts.
Fantastic rather than wearing prepared clothes for a favorite brand, this collection is almost as incredible as Elsa Schiaparelli’s famous coat hat.
This time the fashion houses, which had long played an excentral image, appeared to be very modern.
You will find aesthetic solutions for emotions, omars, hearts and eyes.
Schiaparelli was created in 1930 and was the first designer whose patterns were subdivided by music.
She and her friend, Salvador Dali, intended to reconcile art and fashion, and now Calvin Kleina and Rafa Simons, who cooperate with U.S. artist Sterling Ruby.
The legend of Scland is that the Dali, together with Schiaparelli, and the omara motivated western dress before the demonstration, wanted to eradicate a real majonezas, but did not receive approval.

“We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is indistinguishable from the history of “Schiaparelli”, said Bertrandas Guyonas, a creative director of the last three years, spoken at the fashion house in Vandomo square.
When he created a collection of ready clothes, he based on Schiaparelli’s friendship with My Ray and in collaboration with My Ray Foundation, he created clothes according to well-known artworks.
The picture “Standard tears” of the close eyes of the artist is pictured on the shirts that were shirt with the tears of “Perspex”, and the red lips from “Observatory Time: In lovers” are depicted on true silhouette dresses with collar.
My Ray's "Sticky tears" on the collection shirt
One of Elsa's strangeness was the superficial desire for the letter S. Her firm color – “Scirking pink” inspired her smells “Scirating”.
The first Guyono creativity “Schiaparelli” handbag with the key hole on the buckle is called “Secret”.
Its retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
Yesterday, a temporary store was opened on the old left coast, showing the surrealistic half of the Paris Fashion Week, and 100 € was available for Virgilo Abloho carpets from the nearest Ikea collection.
Over 500 young fans of Abloh were divided in a row on the shore for half an hour before the opening, reluctant to buy one of his works at better prices than the men's clothes of Louis Vuitton.
This project helps Ablohu to reach a wider audience than the one for which luxury fashion or designers create furniture.
“Nobody has any property anymore, but knowledge of a particular chair can help to create a conversation at the dinner table.
This is what the millennium generation thinks," he said recently.
The viewers gathered in Maros in the district realized that this event would not be normal when the patterns began driving through them on the rollers.
The collection of free colorful men's and women's clothes by Andreas Kronthaler, a man designer of Vivienna Westwood, was based on the portraits of Jessicos Fulford-Dobson Kabul's skaters.
Some women (and several men) with high - eye - inspiring sandals traveled with snowboards, but they had their own respiring high - height platform shoes.
Westwood, after watching the performance in the first row and wearing a collection dress with horse's motives and orange through a waist cardigan, joined his husband, who gave her the flowers peacket for the last bending on the bedroom.
Strong twin bond in photos
Peter Zelewski, who lived in London, was already established as a street photographer when he began taking a twin photograph four years ago.
“I, as a portrait photographer and a man, always admired the twins and their extraordinary relationship, all of which are talking about,” he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but, according to him, “I gained dependence from the photography of the first twin portrait and the road was no longer back.”
Soon the book “Two” of Zelewski will print photos and stories of 44 identical twin pairs.
This project is more visual, he says: “It is not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to photograph the impacts and sensible portraits of people."
Careers expressed their distrust in the trade union that conducted wage negotiations
Members of the Royal College of Nurses, unsatisfactory for the trade union transaction with the National Health Service for salaries, after voting, expressed distrust to the Union and accused it of distorting claims for salary increases that were expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after the long-standing debate at the Royal College of Nurses, when his former Secretary-General Janeta Davies acknowledged incorrectly promised members that their salaries will be increased immediately by 3% this year when the 1% wage limit is abolished.
In the absence of the expected salary rise, the members angry and forced Davies to withdraw from office, then submitted a petition and held an urgent meeting in Birmingem, followed by a distrust to the college council.
“The fair and open debate in Birmingem helped to clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen,” said Maria Trewern, Director of the Royal College of Nurses.
“Balsing is clear and the Royal College of Nurses board and management understood the message sent to it.
In recent weeks, the Council has already sought changes in the organisation and has tried to listen to and include the words of the members; we will continue to work on this."
The meeting will take place next week and the members of the Board of the Royal College of Nurses are expected to leave.
“Service is based on trust,” said the national health care nurse for the Guardian newspaper.
“The actions of the Council of the Royal College of Nurses have undermined trust in it, and the Council must therefore leave.
I hope that she will do this with respect and listen to the request.
It is interesting whether members of other trade unions will also seek reorganisation."
The State Officer of the General Trade Union at the National Health Service Rachel Harrison said in August “Guardian” said: “When earnings have been received, the employees of the National Health Service from all over the country have understood without having received the expected lift.
It's angering them."
Before the extraordinary meeting, the Royal College of Nurses recognised that they had made mistakes in the 2018 wage negotiations and had been poorly informed of them.
However, it is also stated that the Royal College of Nurses campaign on the abolition of wage restrictions has forced the government to abandon this restriction and to commit to a gradual increase in wages of 6.5% over three years.
The vote was held following an independent investigation that found that the college was tending to land in negotiations and Davies was accused of having underestimated the transaction.
It is argued that the Royal College of Care has provided inconsistencies with facts and that the members could not make a reasonable decision on the transaction and have not considered alternatives.
The College published conflicting information on whether all employees would receive 3% of the salary increase.
In a short report prior to the college meeting, representatives were wrongly told that "3 % increase and increase were planned for the gradual implementation of the reform".
Indeed, wages should have been gradually raised to 3% and only some of the largest wage workers would have immediately increased.
“Almost all the information provided to members after the meeting on the implementation of the transaction was wrong (for the most rapid reason that it was tried to simplify),” said the representative of the Electoral Reform Service who carried out the investigation.
In the view of the decision-makers, the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not understood and briefly explained and the main advantages, including the 6,5 and 29% calculations mentioned during the campaign, were not clearly identified and therefore a reasonable solution could not be taken."
The decision to express distrust was endorsed by 78 % of the votes and 3.74 % of the members of the Royal College of Nurses took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked Instagram direct broadcasters trying to "give" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan was criticised for Instagram's direct broadcast, through which she followed the homeless family on the street and tried to separate the son from the parents.
Direct broadcasts, probably filmed in Moscow (based on the history of Lohan's previously updated Instagram), at the beginning, the actor offered to provide the family with accommodation, but the situation quickly complicated.
“High for everyone! I want to show what family I met,” she said to the viewers, “the refugees from Syria, I am very concerned about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to go with me?
Come, I'll take care of you," she said to the family before turning to one of the children: “Do you want to stay in the hotel?
Look at the movies?
It would be fun watching a movie on TV or on a computer."
When the parents refused, Lohan responded against him.
“Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If someone offers them home and accommodation, as I am now, you should agree.
They'll come back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't laugh with me."
When the family tried to leave Lohan by walking off the street, the actor followed it by further direct broadcasting through Instagram.
“Keep watching what's happening – it's child trafficking, so you're ageing Arab culture.
You have children, though they don't want to go with you.
Boys, don't worry, I'm with you and now see us all the world."
The transmission ended with physical confrontation – it seems that the mother hit Lohan.
Video clips spread to the social media and some users were interested whether this could not be comparable to the attempt to abduct.
The Independent contacted the Lohan representative for comments.
A third of the British believes that they will never pay all their debts
Almost one third of the British believes that they will not be able to cover their debts in their lives, and one person in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
The study carried out by Equifax and Gorkana, the results of which were only disclosed by The Independent, showed that the British, especially among the ages of 18-24, believe that debts will have to be incurred all the lifetime, and only half of them expect to leave them.
Last year, the report published by the Institute of Fiscal Research shows that students who have completed their studies remain in debt of approximately 46 000 pounds and that the poorest students are in debt of over 57 000 pounds.
The majority of graduates (81 percent) will never pay full debt and will therefore be under pressure for the first 30 years.
Public debts are growing: According to the National Statistics Department, the United Kingdom family debts are record and the British spend an average of 900 pounds each year more than earnings.
However, is it worth worried about this terrible statistics?
Is it just a new standard lifestyle for young adults (and society as a whole) lifelongly pressing debts?
As an example, cars that are another big purchase are purchased by purchasing homes (if such a success is smiled).
Auto Trader predicted this week that all new cars will be purchased in a cost-effective manner in the decade, which will be the usual means of purchasing vehicles.
The director of EQ Investors and certified financial planner Jeannie Boyle believe that expectations have indeed changed.
“In these days it is really normal to have debts: popular credit cards, interest-free refinancing, student loans and quick credits,” she said.
"The generations of our grandparents were ashamed of having debt."
Currently, students' debts and housing prices have become a normal phenomenon.
Moira O'Neill, Head of Interactive Investor's Personal Finance Department, also supports this statement, which believes that the results may raise concern.
“If you borrow a huge amount that four or five times exceeds your income, it may appear that there will be no additional debt,” she explained.
And so people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts must think about what would happen if the rates were to rise."
It must not be surprised that the comments of the financial industry are not questionable.
Brian Brodie, Executive Director of Freedom Finance, says: “School is not a taboo.
The loan for the purchase of home repair or new car shall no longer be considered as the last option.
Low interest rates have contributed to savings in fixed-term deposits, which generate higher returns, but are not so easy to reach.
Therefore, the middle class is increasingly borrowing.
Over the past six months, about half of the new loans were taken by customers with excellent creditworthiness assessment."
Richard Haymes, head of TDX Group's financial problem resolution department, believes that such expectations – not to get out of debt throughout life – are really worrying.
He says: “Inflation in August was the highest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rates rose, and there was only a small increase in captive growth, and the decision of many people to borrow without a realistic plan to repay their debts is disturbing.
Our analysis has shown that this year the number of insolvents will grow by 17 percent, which is a key factor in the record lending of consumers."
The debt may not be a lot of concern until a person is working and earning, but it is unclear how unpaid debts will affect his wellbeing in the old age.
The study carried out by the Economic and Business Research Centre, together with the funds borrowing specialists from More 2 Life, showed that people's unguaranteed debt in the past four years has increased by more than one third, i.e. more than twice the average of the country.
This age group is usually borrowed through credit cards and spends 30 percent more monthly than earnings.
The Boyle adds: “The increasing number of people who have reached 55 years of age choose to pay their debts from pension funds, which will affect their lives in pensions.
These are mostly the only savings they have "compulsory" to save.
In addition, people think that using the assets will pay later, but the exchange of the assets to the cheaper is not as much money as expected.
If the price of the asset falls, this situation will only be worse."
I Touch Myself sings up to half of Serena Williams to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams published a video in which she sings a classic song of Divinyls with the hands of I Touch Myself.
Tennis Axe shared the clip on its Instagram page and explained that the video was created to encourage women to check their own breasts.
“I’ve recorded the version of the world hit “I Touch Myself” in the month of the fight against breast cancer to remind women to check themselves regularly,” wrote Williams.
“Yes I went out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do so because this problem affects the woman of all races around the world.
The most important thing to determine is to save many lives as soon as possible.
I hope I can remind women of this."
Williams continued: "This music clip is part of the project "I Touch Myself Project", which is implemented for the glory of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us his hit to remind women first of all of their health."
The project supported by the bottom triangle brand Berlin for Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA) started in 2014 after the death of Amphlett 53 years.
The image record published by the tennis star in its Instagram account has received more than 1.5 million reviews and many sirs praise for how the tenniser singed the song.
“The warmest wishes for this clip and your courage to do this.
Thank you, Seren," wrote one fan.
Another adds: “Serena, this is the story.
20 years ago, I found breast cancer and nodule myself, even when the mammograms did not show anything.
You just need to check it out.
Thank you for not afraid of leaving the comfort zone – you're a real goddess!"
For the "Berlei" project, "I Touch Myself Project" also released a new snake type of "The Chrissy", inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profits from the sale of the bra will be sacrificed by BCNA.
It is important to know which signs and symptoms should be addressed when checking themselves.
Signs of breast cancer are not only nodules, but also changes in the size or shape of the breast, rashes or wounds, speniles discharges, skin surface ingestion, persistent pain or skin texture changes.
In addition, swelling at the upper arm or keyboard, swelling of the veins and a dip spine may be warned of cancer.
It is recommended that women check their breasts every month.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, it is recommended that the NHS contact your family doctor immediately.
If you have been examined by your family doctor that your symptoms need to be further evaluated, it will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adams Driveris forced the entire SNL filming group to quote
Adam Driveris was the inviting star of this week's Saturday Night Live and has actually tried to ride everyone.
The best performance laughings are often not related to a specific relevant event – like the new exhibition called Karjera Day.
The U.S. secondary school day, when students bring their fathers, and the teen of Mortdecus (Pete Davidson) do not want to agree that his father, old oil magnesium Abraham H. Parnassus (Addam Driveris), would speak.
Parnassus, who is a resting ladder, whose megalomanic personality could be inspired by Daniel Day-Lewiss, Daniel Plainview from the film “Bus blood”, tells us how the oil industry was dominated.
“I was born in seven months too early,” says Parnassus to the students.
“The incubator technology has just been invented, so I was put in a cast iron cup and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones were not hardened, but not my spirit!
Be strong and shake your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague, the SNL actor Aidy Bryant, who plays a teacher, barely keeps laughing and can't watch the Driver in the eyes.
However, the jumps of the “Star Wars” actor are just fleeing and he begins to tell about the personal war with another oil magnat H. R. Pickins.
“I guided your grandchild!”
“I filled her belly with my struggling seeds and ruined your boy – this is my final refreshment, H. R.!"
In less than five minutes, Parnassus became the same character of Adam Driver as Kylo Renas from two films.
“Be damn, H.R.!"
Founded Kendrick Lamaro songs: eight unhearded works appeared on the Internet
It seems that many unleashed songs of Kendrick Lamaar have been convicted.
On Saturday, eight unhearded works were spread on the Internet, the parties of which were inserted by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay Rock, Isaiah Rashad and Abi Soul.
It is unclear where the song spread from, and the image of the set “Bad Kid Chill City EP” and the cover (which is probably created by the fan) are not formal.
Only demonstrational and unfinished versions of songs may be leaked, sounding as if they were recorded in different stages of Lamara career.
Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, and Heroin, divided together with SZA, would be more similar to the sound track DAMN./Black Panther.
The following songs are distributed in the package:
‘Gang Member’;
"The only Nigga";
“Want In Life”;
Loved Ones (with SZA);
‘Own This City’;
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah'u Rashadu and Ab Soul)’;
“Look Over Your Shoulders” (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternativeate".
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamaro's representative for a comment.
Murder "Čikaga": when tickets are left in Klaipėda, you are invited to travel to Vilnius or Kaunas
The desire of Lithuanians to see Klaipėda State Music Theatre Music "Čikaga" is not inviting.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musicians of all times have prepared to another tour through the largest stage of the country.
However, about 1.5 months before the performances, the halls start to stand up.
The organizers declare that all tickets to the musical scene in Klaipėda "Švituro" are already sold, tickets and performances in Kaunas "Žalgiris" and Vilnius "Siemens" are rapidly dissolved.
In the port city, tickets have been gone for some time, so we invite everyone who wants to see this indifferent unleavening musician to go to Kaunas or Vilnius, where the tickets are still a little.
The exhibitions will take place in December, so we will not only see our music, but also have a great opportunity to look at the eglutes of the largest cities in the country," Laima Vilimienė, Head of the State Theatre of Klaipėda, offers the opportunity for the fans of the music.
In December, the viewers of Čikaga will meet the changes in the composition of artists.
One of the main musical roles is first entrusted to the actor Thomas Žaib.
A talented and well-known actor in Chicago is the unique body of Billy Flynna - the best and most influential attorney in Chicago, apart from the scrupulous changes in human fate.
Since the Klaipėda State Music Theatre Music "Čikaga" is adapted to larger spaces, the composition of the artists appearing in it is also larger than the work shown in Brodvey.
In Lithuania, almost half of the artists appear in Chicago.
The main roles of women are entrusted with the fascinating soloist of Klaipėda State Music Theatre Beata Ignatavičiūtė (Murder Velma Kelly) and charismatic soloist of Kaunas Music Theatre Gabriele Bielskyte (Murder Roxie Hart).
The museum "Chicago" represents the criminal world of Chicago in the 19th century, which turns the walls of the prison into the hill of stars.
It is a musical surrender of criminal justice, telling about two people who seek recognition.
Music perfumed sexuality and irony.
No matter where and what the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - would be like to illuminate a glossing star.
Their life is life because of the message on the first page, on the headline, shine, fame alley...
On December 13, "Čikaga" will be displayed on the Klaipėdos "Švituro" Arena, on December 18 - on Kaunas "Žalgiris" Arena, on December 20 - on Vilnius "Siemens" Arena.
The tickets are distributed by "Tiketa".
Website furniture in Kaunas
The website can be named as a representative house area, where we spend time with friends, accept guests, etc. Therefore it should be installed in such a way that it is comfortable not only for the owners of the apartment or house, but also for the guests.
Depending on the size of the site, walls, ceiling decoration, the taste of hosts, the appropriate furniture should be selected.
The website should be not only beautiful, but also comfortable.
It is best to invite the interior designer to help it to fill the space optimally so that it is not overloaded or vice versa - too empty.
It is advisable to first set the main point of the website, i.e. the item to which you will combine the furniture, other details.
This can be a fool or another important focus on the interior of the site.
It would also be great to create a chat room where guests can communicate comfortably so that they can not be disturbed by furniture located outside the site, etc.
Sophos, chairs should be set close to each other so that your guests can sit down and talk.
Therefore, the layout of furniture must promote communication, unification of people, and not dismantling them from one another.
Don't push the furniture at the wall.
The size of the room depends on the distance of the walls.
Although the room is small, leave at least a little space from the wall, do not push the furniture near her.
If the room is large, leave more space from the walls.
Indeed, the greater the distance, the better.
Set up the balance for furniture
Consider the various details that will be on your website. Size and location.
All elements must be negotiated between themselves.
Site furniture must be compatible with interior details.
A small contrast is possible.
He will boost the interior of the site, but it should not be too large, because the interior will become foolish.
We advise always to discuss with interior designers.
By creating the interior of the site itself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you risk getting a derogation from extremes: or you will create a boring interior because you are afraid to experiment, mistake, wrongly choose or continue to be improvised.
Suitable lighting
This is a very important thing.
After all, different light reveals space differently.
Lighting shall be provided at various levels: ceiling luminaires, wall luminaires, and luminaires on the floor.
The prosecutor appealed to the LKF leaders’ conviction
Vilnius Regional Prosecutor’s Prosecutor’s Office appealed against the judgment of the Vilnius Regional Court to former heads of the Lithuanian Basketball Federation (LKF).
According to the Prosecutor's Office on Monday, the complaint states that the municipality of Panevėžys had no legal basis to contribute to the reconstruction of the private hotel in Panevėžys with the funds of the municipal budget.
In the pre-trial investigation, it was found that, in order to find the possibility of financing the reconstruction of the hotel, a public service contract was concluded in 2010 between the Lithuanian basketball federation and the municipality of Panevėžys.
According to the prosecutors, some of the services that the federation had to provide to Panevėžys City Municipality under the contract were not intended and could not be provided, since the planned financing of the services had already been received or envisaged by the State and the sponsors, some of the planned events had already taken place before the signing of the contract and had already been paid out from other funds, and some of the events took place already after the VAT invoices were issued - money was transferred on the basis of invoices for the events which had not yet taken place.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's prosecution argues that it is not in agreement with the judgment of the Court of First Instance that the State itself obliged and commissioned the city government of Panevėžys to take up the reconstruction of the private hotel, since no state obligation on a particular hotel was made, just a proposal to Panevėžys City Municipality to resolve the development of hotels required for the championship as soon as possible.
According to the Prosecutor’s opinion, the Court unreasonably held that the heads of LKF and Panevėžys have tried to fulfil the State’s obligation without having legal paths, since the data in the case show that there was an opportunity to organise competitions of the European basketball championship group in other cities, without prejudice to the laws.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor's Prosecutor's Appeal asks for the annulment of the judgment of the Court of First Instance and for the adoption in this case of a new judgment of seven natural persons and one legal person.
On the 15th of October, the Vilnius County Court fully convicted Mindaugas Balčiūnas, Secretary-General of the LKF, for all incredibly committed crimes.
This case concerns preparation for the European Basketball Championship in Lithuania in 2011.
Ms Balčiūn has been accused of abuse, fraud and other crimes.
Prosecutor Balčiūnas was accused that, in his duties as Secretary-General of the LKF, he agreed with the Chief Financer and the Executive Director of the Federation to record on behalf of the Federation the performance of works that do not correspond to reality - transfer acts and other counterfeit financial documents included in the official accounts and accounts of services provided to the LKF in the country of Panevėžys Municipality.
According to a study carried out by the Office of Special Investigation (STT) Panevėžys Board officials, the funds of Panevėžys City Municipality could be deceited and counterfeited for the benefit of the LKF and the reconstruction of the Via Unica hotel "Romantic" later used.
Dalia Kuklierienė, the leader of this hotel, is charged with buying-in - it is suspected that she gave a television to Mr Balčiūn as a big one.
All those judged with Mr Balčiūn have been judged.
The accusations in this case were lodged with eight natural persons and one legal person - the Lithuanian basketball federation.
Remote place of work - like the Bermuda Triangle
In Lithuania, the number of people injured or killed at work has already exceeded the total population of Alytus from 1992 to now, reaching around 83 thousand.
If the specific requirements for the physical place of work and its security are clear, it becomes the choice to work remotely from home, public spaces or even other countries as a separate new triangle of Bermuds.
According to insurance professionals, although the Law on Safety and Health at Work provides for the provision of safety and health conditions for workers working remotely from other workers in the company, the diversity of modern forms of work can raise a number of issues, reports the press report.
In the event of an accident in the home, the employer shall pay the compensation for the first two days of unemployment after 80% and for the rest of the period of treatment "Sodra".
If it is found that an accident occurred during work, Sodra shall reimburse 100% of the wages from the first day of incapacity.
In assessing the statistics provided by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage administered by the BTA, it is evident that the absolute majority of accidents and various injuries at work occur at the workplace.
Most often these are a variety of physical work where the risk of injury is higher: careless treatment of devices or equipment, loss of concentration or coordination.
However, offices, where the majority of the most demanding, best-paid specialists are currently concentrated, face their own challenges that employers have given and workers have a particularly enjoyed freedom of mobility," says Jevgenija Krikščiūnė, Head of the Human Resources Management Division of the BTA.
In the legal acts in force in Lithuania, it is recommended that the duties of the employee and the limitations of responsibility be clearly regulated, the definition of working time, place and functions, and that this also applies in the form of work remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether or not an accident occurred during work.
Situations and nuances are really different, each case is examined individually.
Workers are often heard of the fact that, for example, the employer is responsible for the accidents taking place during or during the course of the work.
However, there are very many nuances and reservations in this case, so I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate interviews, to clarify and to make a maximum clear and mutually acceptable description of what situations are actually considered to be accidents at work and which will already have the status of domestic injuries", - advises the expert.
Mr Krikščiūnė claims that, in today’s times, when computer and mobile phone and stable Internet connections are often sufficient to perform work functions, the worker will not necessarily work at the place and time specified in the agreement.
Workers are mobile, they can choose to work at a time, not at home, but when drinking coffee in a café or a park enjoying the sun.
It's gonna be a place of work or not?
What if the working hours discussed are not in line with the agreement?
There may be really different situations, the circumstances of which help to clarify the research carried out, the initiation of "Sodra" or State Labour Inspectorate", says the specialist.
According to it, in financial terms, the main difference between the accident at work and the household is the amount of the unemployment benefit.
J. Krikščiūnė admits that it was necessary to informally hear the unpleasant experiences when employers are trying to conceal the real circumstances of accidents or traumas and try to advertise workers to approach medical staff outside of their work, to take responsibility for themselves, thus complaining financially.
This is an unfair, disregardable attitude toward the worker and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: the employer's civil liability insurance for damage to workers, the acquisition of accident insurance against injury, insurance for disability or even death, as well as current and health insurance," says Mr Krikščiūnė.
Mobile signature system restarts
After removal of the failure in Lithuania again operates a mobile signature system, BNS approved representatives of the service provider Estonian IT company SK ID Solutions.
This company reported the disturbances on Monday morning, inconvenience experienced by companies "Bite", "Telia" customers and part of "Tele2" users.
The disturbances were also recorded in Estonia, but the representatives of SK ID Solutions could not comment on the situation in that country.
Lithuanian regbio collector - Polish lessons
The collection of Lithuanian regbia, debuting in the division of European Traphy, is currently difficult to match with higher level rivals.
The Branch of Trophy in the Old Continent is the third in terms of capacity after the Tournament of Six nations and the European Championship.
There's a 13-18-rated continental team.
The Lithuanians of Streaming began in October a solitary victory in Šiauliai 30:10 against the Czech team.
On the last weekend, the Lithuanian team was visited in Lodz, where it was not like the Polish collector - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were self-confessed, they often violated the rules in the rumors, and the Polish regbrians were exploded with the screaming of the fine.
Wojciech Piotrowiczius, who gave its own 12-point balance, realised the fines of 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes.
In the first chair, 10 minutes Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card of Tautvydas Mazylis.
On the second knee, guests arranged a few attacks, but they failed to complete them effectively.
At that time, the Poles managed to break our defence.
The ball was forced in the county area by Mateuss Plichta, then by Krystianas Pogorzelskis and Mateuss Adamskis.
A Lithuanian team coach from PAR Ntando Manyosha, playing in addition to several important regbbits, recognized the advantage of rivals and said that such matches gave a lot of valuable experience.
"The tens played very well and dominated all the components of the game.
Our aim was to sustain as long as possible in these games.
We have just risen to this higher level and we have to understand it.
We have won the first match against the cheques, but we have now met very powerful rivals and have had to recognise their advantage.
The Polish team gave us a useful lesson," said the specialist from PAR, who has been standing for four years at the Lithuanian team's steering.
The next game in "Trophy" division Lithuanians will play on April 6, 2019 at home with Portuguese or Romanian.
The Dutch and Swiss teams still compete in this division.
Joseph Blaziun became advisor to the Minister of Culture
Minister of Culture Liana Ruokytė-Jonsson started working as advisor to Joseph Blažiūnas.
Mr Blažiūnas Minister for Advisable Archives, Libraries, Museums and Cultural Heritage Management, reported by the Ministry.
J. Blažiūnas, who has acquired a scientific degree in the field of artistic sciences at Vilnius Academy of Arts, has so far been the director of Lithuanian literature and art archives, the docent of the Department of Museumology of the Faculty of Communication of Vilnius University.
According to the report, the Minister's adviser is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and the conservation of values.
Japanese Coast Guard is intensively searching for the missing island
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to the whole small island in the north of Japan in 2014.
A small, insignificant and worthless island, which was basically inappropriate for life, was of great importance for Japan.
It is so important that the area that is now missing is intensively explored - would it still be?
Why does Japan need this island?
It's not gonna be.
It is likely that the ice and underwater slippers have taken this island forever, although it has recently blown it almost two meters above the surface of the water.
It is almost doubtful that the island has simply broken down, but at least its traces are expected to be found.
When the island disappeared nobody knows exactly - it was so worthless that no one had too much of it and did not shepherd.
Probably the first to learn about the disappearance of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima was Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as an auxiliary tool for visual navigation.
Its disappearance, even for these fishermen, is not a tragedy because there are better ways to catch, where fishing can be made, and where the disputed waters of Russia begin.
That was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima.
This narrow strap was the western edges of the Couril Hall.
This island chain, which Russia calls the Couril Islands and Japan - the North Territories.
Conflict with such breaks has continued since the middle of the 19th century, but the full force took place in the 20th century.
There are natural resources in these areas, but Japan is also of historical view that the islands should belong to it.
The point is that the Japanese have been studying these islands since the mid - 17th century.
They were the first to draw up a map, and they carried out more detailed studies to register a number of small halls.
The agreements between Japan and Russia signed in 1855.
These two countries thus lived until 1905, when the Russian Empire war in Saharan lost Japan.
In 1945, the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened the islands of Kuril.
Japan, by the way, does not mean large claims for the whole malt, although there were the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunash, the islands of Scotland and Chabomay.
Japan feels that it has historical rights because the islands were examined by the first ones, while Japan also belonged to the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan offered Russia to share these four islands equally, but Russia did not even consider adopting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the North Territories, but now that the island disappears, this geographical link is like lost.
The physical marker of Japan's presence in these waters has disappeared.
This is a major loss, which is why the island's residues are sought.
However, even when they are found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not be in line with the simple definition of the island - it must be land.
This means a slight reduction in the territory of Japan and a significant reduction in the Exclusive Economic Area, calculated from the coast.
It's just interesting what the island search mission expects, because it's not going to have lost or gone.
Unbelievable drama of Lithuanian and Polish boxing teams in the dual fight
More than a week, the final verdict of judges had to wait for the winners of the cross-border meeting between Lithuanian and Polish box teams.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian twokovs were held in Poland.
The four akistate won the Lithuanians as well as the Polish.
On the other hand, the end of the two-fighting is due to a long-standing debate of the Chamber of Judges and a final decision of the secretariat of the competitions.
The election meeting began with the victory of Lithuanian boxers.
3:0 won Jacuba Surma, and soon Edgars Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) after the enduring fight 2:1 overcome Radomir Obrušniak.
Two successors followed: Damian Durkacz (up to 64 kg) 3:0 overcome Mant Dužin, and Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 exceeded Simon Bani.
Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg) returned the balance to the Lithuanian collector.
Lithuanian 2:1 won Bartosz Golebewsky.
In the next battle, Piotras Szczukowkis (up to 81 kg) at the third round, a clear balance was overcome by Eigirdas Kasmotis, and the result again became 3:3.
The brothers, Jocules, were differently imitated.
Robert Joculis (up to 91 kg) 3:0 won Andrew Colton, and Arvydas Jokulis (over 91 kg) had to recognise the advantage of Adam Kulic at the first round.
The main discussion was the fight against Tado Tamašausko (up to 91 kg) and Mikalo Soczynskis.
It is due to the final publication of the results of its cross-border meeting that took more than a week.
One judge gave a victory to the Polish, two judges - the Lithuanian, but due to a technical error, a point addressed to the Lithuanian judge was included in Mr Soczynski.
After long-standing disputes, the victory was left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
At the Lithuanian-Poland Electoral Meeting, the victory was won by hosts at 10:8 (two points for the victory).
They managed to respond to the Lithuanians for the tricky loss suffered by the last mosque.
At a meeting in Marympole in 2015, Lithuanian boxers won five fights out of six and won the victory result at 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian team leaders in Poland was a general rehearsal before the Lithuanian boxing championship in Šilutė on 14-17 November.
After the country's prizes, a new Lithuanian boxing team will be formed, which will defend the country's honour in the next year's world and European championships.
How does the dog determine in which direction the person went?
You already know that the dog’s oesophagus is very sensitive.
They can smell hidden explosives, drugs, blood, and other animals, some even recognize diseases by smell.
Excellently known and filmed traces of dogs, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine in which direction the owner of traces went?
Indeed, this issue is much more complex than you think.
The tracking of traces consists of three stages: finding, setting and tracking.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, because it is difficult to decide in which direction the person stepped.
After all, there is no second in the different steps, so their fragrance does not differ greatly, isn't it?
Not so much.
In 1990, the study of the University of Oslo described experiments that led the dog to 90 degrees in the trajectory of the man’s trajectory.
Tests have been carried out on the grass and on the asphalt.
And in many cases dogs easily set the direction of the human move, even when he tried to mislead them through the passage of the backs.
Can you imagine how difficult it is?
The difference between the surrounding traces of the fragrance is very small and is further reduced with time.
However, scientists say that this is not so strange: the dogs could say and which part of the foot affected the ground first.
This is because their wrath is an incredible tool.
Dog’s brain is dominated by areas responsible for the oesophagus (as our brain dominates regions responsible for the vision).
Dog nose contains 125-300 million smell receptors.
In general, the dog’s oesophagus is at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but even more important is their ability to interpret different smells.
Scientists then carried out analogue experiments and traces left with bicycles, but the tracking of their direction in dogs was much more difficult.
This is due to the fact that bike cancers are not segmented as traces of the passing person, so it is more difficult to isolated different locations for comparison - it is not natural for dogs, so more time is needed.
True, dogs are not owners of the strongest ass.
This title is likely to come to bears.
The males of white bears have hundreds of kilometres tracked by the mosquitoes, and the brown bears smell a twisted animal even for 30 miles.
Private forests promise to regulate crossings
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain on Tuesday in the Seimas about the crossing of forests.
At the end of August, there was a public dissatisfaction with the forests crossed in the Labanoro regional park.
The month was stopped by the crossing of these forests.
The Minister has recognised that investigations of crossings by Labanore have shown that no gross violations have been committed.
However, the Ministry of the Environment has already introduced part of the restrictions in view of the working group's proposal to strengthen the crossing of forests in state-owned forests.
The Minister promises that other legislation to adjust forest crossings will be drawn up by the end of the year.
There are the same limitations as in public forests, for private forest holdings.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy of 170 thousand followers
We need to give people what they want and together intervene what they want, says Agnė Jagelavičiūtė in the LRT TV program "Culturatively with Nomeda".
According to stylists, she gradually formed a huge crowd of fans.
"At first, you apply man's taste, you're tempting to yourself, and you're improving the taste over time," A. Jagelavičiūtė believes.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers on her feisbuko account - she has reached this number by using a strategy: "You first apply the human taste, you're tempting to yourself, you're improving the taste over time."
Stilist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims that she does not suffer from uncertainty, and therefore shows her face as it is - authenticity and ability to find the best way of presentation are the most important criteria of popularity in social networks.
She observes that human cultures are no longer left in social networks, because many internauts come to them in order to make comments from other people who are involuntary with someone: "For example, in the teenager, I wanted to be angry with everyone, and I have no longer wanted it."
"Incredible life is the most terrible thing.
And there is a lot of this in social networks.
In Feisbuke a little less than instagram," she speaks.
A. Jagelavičiūtė, a teacher of interior design and painting education, says a specific message in social networks - talks about women's emancipitation.
It also advertises the production produced by magazines, and its work is also seen by creatives.
"I can't say that the fashion magazine is the expression of pure art, but I know that there's a lot of it there.
I believe that there is a lot of creation in my work, like emptyness.
I'm balancing - it's my key to these huge numbers.
I don't want to create a false life.
What is better to give people what they want, and to silently intervene what they want," Mr Jagelavičiūtė believes.
One of the most difficult events that attract young people is classical music concerts.
They were offered to increase their popularity through lifestyle stories: talk about curiosity, failures, and lifestyle events, thus remaining authentic.
It is this strategy that Mrs Jagelevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
According to her, the culture has no opportunity to enjoy, enjoy, and display true values.
"How boring teacher against students - are there odds?
If we do not find a way of presenting that art, do not advertise without advertisement, but it will not work.
When we are realistic and get a reader, maybe someone will change.
Once, second, third - and already addiction', she shares her insights.
Three people disappeared from the fall of the helicopter in the Gulf of Lituya north of Jun
Saturday after the helicopter accident to the north of Jun in Alaska, three people were searched.
One man was saved after Friday’s disaster, and the other three could not be found.
The helicopter fell near the Gulf of Lituya, northwest of Jun.
Airbus H125 was found to be a long journey to Grand Prerey in Texas.
On Friday, 100 ft of the shore was detected.
According to Associated Press, one saved person was 14 years old.
It has been reported to have mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
Two adults and two teenagers flew on the dropped helicopter.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Josha Pepperd (42) and Andrew Pepperd (11).
The senior Pepperd was found to be the director of the Aliaska construction company Davis Constructors & Engineerings.
I don't know what the accident caused.
The National Transport Security Council stated that an investigation was initiated.
"I'm going to take a helicopter, which was completely new – just received from the factory, two adults and two teenagers," states the report of the coastal security officers, based on the CIA.
The pilot has been found to have 40 years of experience in the flight of fixed wing aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Aliaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky said that the loved ones “have not yet lost hope for a miracle”.
By helping the coastguard helicopter, the rescuers updated the search of experienced alpinists on the Nevis Mountain Fort William in Scotland on 17 February 2016.
On Saturday, in Alaska, there were three people who disappeared after the helicopter accident.
"I have experienced sexual violence"
Presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway revealed sexual violence on Sunday morning.
Conway commented on the arous disputes between judge Bretto Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and his accused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
Conway was excited to reveal that he had experienced sexual violence himself, and he defended Kavanaugh against the leader Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge was accused of sexual violence by ignoring the negative facts of the accusation.
“I am deeply sympathetic to victims of sexual violence and violence.
I have experienced sexual violence," Conway said at the CNN Sunday show "State of the Union".
“I am a victim of sexual violence, and I do not think judge Kavanaugh, Take Tapper, Jeff Flake or anything else is responsible for it.
We must be responsible for our own conduct."
Conway claimed that the news network should be shameful for the comparison of Kavanaugh with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to prison in Pennsylvania State for three to ten years.
Conway also criticised the Senate Committee on Courts, because he was unable to remove former President Billo Clinton, who took oral sex in his office and lied to the US people.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh and Ford’s evidence divided the US society
The Americans disagree with the evidence of Bretto Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford – the accuser claims that the judge had sexually attacked her when they were teenagers.
Ford or Kavanaugh’s lying is almost coincided with: 38 percent of the polled people say that Kavanaugh was probably or undoubtedly lying with the evidence given, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Court Committee listened to both parties when Ford sent a letter to the Senator Dianne Feinstein with detailed accusations to the judge.
After publicising the letter, both Ford and Kavanaugh said that they were ready to speak before the committee.
By giving evidence, Ford claimed that it was 100 percent sure that at the party in the early 1980s she tried to attack Kavanaugh, not another person.
In an emotional introductory speech, 51 years old, a woman said that she felt a civil responsibility and could not silence.
“I am very scared,” she said.
"I'm here because I think my civil duty is to tell me what happened when Brett Kavanaugh and I were learning at secondary school."
Ford and two other women, who denied the suspicion of sexual violence, said that “have never been sexually attacked in secondary school, college or any time later”.
“All that he could have tried to find someone who would prevent me from voting for my nomination, no matter how unrealistic or foolish, ” he said.
"This is the simplest slander last minute."
The results of the survey by YouGov on 27 and 28 September, in which 2607 people were surveyed, are not surprised – the opinions of the people who felt to different parties were different: the supporters of the democrats are more believed by Ford (73 percent) and the republicians – Kavanaugh (74 percent), although Ford believed more republicians than the Democrats (14 percent compared to 11 percent).
The founder of the exhibition “Body Worlds”, called “Doctor Death”, wants to be cut and displayed in his own exhibition
An invented German scientist wants to become an eternal part of his exhibition “Body Worlds”.
Gunther von Hagens has developed an innovative approach that allows for the demonstration of beasts, skulls and organs in an exhibition that has traveled around the world, which has received both fascination and contradictory assessments.
A cancer-dead man who was 73 years old told his wife to plasticise him after his death to become a permanent exhibition at Body Worlds, which will be opened this week in London.
“In that sense, it will be the completion of his lifetime work.
Now I understand that I will have to do this because I will express recognition and love", Angelina Whalley said to the newspaper The Observer.
She said that the man gave strict instructions to do with his lady, and the whole process would take about a year.
Muscles, nerves and arteries must be wrapped and the body should be injected into silicone and placed in the position required.
“He said to me, “Angelina, you can freeze me up to –25 degrees Celsius for a year, but then you will have to add your hands, and I will otherwise freeze.”
So I'll be able to destroy a year, then I'll have to do it."
Then, in the most ideal case, by wearing an indistinguishable soft fetral hat in his image, he will join the exhibition in the pavilion of London next to other bodies that stand up during the time with constant positions, such as the horse running or playing cards.
Von Hagens was famous in the United Kingdom for a direct British television broadcast (the first public broadcast in 170 years).
Over 47 million people have been visiting Body Worlds exhibitions around the world since 1995.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernalis, said that 100% of the exhibition, which holds around 28,000 square feet, gave gifts to the people who "successed because they wanted to help the living, educate them and help see possible problems".
“We see and read so terrible things that we fear death.
No one will avoid her, death is common to us all, and I think Body Worlds shows that there is no need to fear," Tabernalis said.
Attorneys of Ronald threaten to prosecution of a judicial action
Attorneys of the Portuguese football star Cristian Ronald said on Friday that the German magazine, which published the “Only Illegal” American statements that Ronald had raped it in 2009, will bring it to court.
One of Ronald’s lawyers, Christian Schertz, stated in his statement that the article of the magazine Dr Spiegel was “inadmissible statement of private accusations” and he will seek legal rewards for his client.
Reuters sent a statement to the agency by Ronald's representative firm Gesifute in response to a request to comment on the article of Dr Spiegel published on Friday online.
Gesifute did not answer any specific questions about the content of Dr Spiegel's statement, which Reuters could not be independently verified.
Dr Spiegel first announced the accusations in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world Ronaldo has earned the title of the best player in the world five times.
This summer he went to Italian Juventus from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the Der Spiegel statement.
The magazine announced that the alleged rape took place in June 2009 at the Las Vegas Hotel room, which was said by Kathryna Mayorga’s lawyer Leslie’s Mark Stovallas, who made the accusation.
The Stovall told the magazine that Ronaldo and Mayorga were not in court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality agreement for $375 000 paid by Ronald.
The Stovall did not reply to the comments of Reuters' emails immediately, and Mayorga did not respond to home phone calls.
However, Stovall said to Dr. Spiegel that he had lodged a civil complaint in order to cancel a confidentiality contract.
The Mayorga magazine Dr. Spiegel said that they thought they were no longer bound by the contract because it still felt the consequences of the night that had been nine years ago.
"I survived serious crises," she said "Der Spiegel".
‘And, the accusation of rape.
I blame him and blame myself for signing it."
Sustainable business that ensures the independence of creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publishing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the #selfpub3.0 website, explains for the first time how to join other entrepreneurs, become independent and start a sustainable creative business.
The founder of the union of independent creators Orna Ross, which has not been recognised for the first time in the publication of one of the 100 most powerful people, will explain in the conference "Digital Book World 2018" why creators should allow "Self-Publishing 3.0" methods.
"The trends in consumption, such as popular personal brands, responsible use and reading by mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies, create a very favourable environment for developers' businesses," Ross says.
However, these opportunities can only be used by independent and creative thinkers and by those who know their power who understand the value of intellectual property.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several sources of earning through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
It is possible to earn from direct sales, subscription models, pooled aid, wide distribution models and other sources of income, such as online training and related activities.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in different formats to the broadest possible audience using retailers and other services.
The main objective of "#selfpub3.0" is to encourage the change in thinking and to learn to manage its creative business so that intellectual property, which is the most important creative property, is not unwaveredly transferred to another company, such as specialised publishers or independent publishing services providers.
According to Ross, so creators can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must be interested not only in every digital age creator, but also in publishers; it also stressed that true independence of creators (like other people) is guaranteed by commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent developers are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing according to demand.
Self-Publishing 2.0 theme is the sale of books for e-books and phones in online book stores.
Now starts a new, Self-Publishing 3.0 era, where independent publishers will be taught to start prospective and sustainable business.
A union of independent creators is the only global non-profit organisation uniting self-declaring writers.
The Union's objective is to develop the skills of independent publishers, to promote ethical activities, to help start-ups sell books and to encourage developers to pursue a sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
Presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian Government of the planned deficit
After hearing the plans of the populist government to significantly increase the deficit costs next year, the Italian President and the head of the Central Bank warned on Saturday that the government debt should be managed.
The Governing Parties (Poptional Movement of Five Stars and the Right North League) submitted a late Thursday evening proposal for the 2019 deficit to reach 2.4 % of gross domestic product (GDP) and three times the goal of the previous administration.
This report merged the market on Friday and encouraged the sale of bonds and put an impact on bank shares.
Moreover, such plans have not been aligned with the European Union, which applies EU fiscal rules and monitors their compliance.
By calling to the audience in the Presidential Chamber, which mentions the 70th anniversary of the constitution, President Sergio Mattarella mentioned that according to the country's framework laws, "budget must be balanced and debts must be managed".
“Yes to protect our citizens,” he said
A little later at a central conference in Italy, Ignazio Visco, President of the Italian bank, said that it is no longer possible to increase the government debt, which is the largest of all the major economies of the European Union and is 131 per cent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, based on the State knowledge agency Ansa.
"The credit must be reduced in a consistent manner."
The Head of the North League and Vice-President Matteo Salvinis responded to Mattarella's words that the debt increased as a result of the strict requirements imposed by Brussels for the year.
“Speak, Mr. President,” Salvinis said in the statement.
"The government debt has been thirsting for the years of European budgets. After all, we are changing plans and aiming for a better future and growth."
Earlier, before Mattarella or Visco spoke, Luigis Di Maio, the Five Star Movement Commander, said that previously stolen money will be returned to people" from the budget, but added that the government is not seeking to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The Governing Parties pressed for the approval of their planned deficit expenditure with non-group economic minister Giovannis Trias.
The Italian media claimed that Mattarella supported Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2 per cent of GDP.
The Presidents of the country and of the Central Bank shall not directly affect economic policy.
The President of 77 years of age can reject the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Then Parliament can re-adopt and legislate the law that is unchanged.
Official information: Indonesian tsunami sensors missed huge waves
The Indonesian geophysics agency withdrew the warning on the tsunami 34 minutes after its release, and then there was a severe earthquake that sent huge waves to the northeast coast of the island of Sulaves, where hundreds of people died and thousands left homeless.
Car cushion after cunami Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018
At least 384 people died during the 7.5 - score earthquake and tsunami, about 1 500 miles [940 miles] away from Jakarta.
The officials stated on Sunday that the number of victims would probably increase.
On Friday, many people gathered to the festival on the beach of Palu, which was hit by the waves of six feet [18 ft] high.
On Saturday, the Geophysics Agency received criticisms in the social media: many people considered whether the cunami warning had not been revoked too early.
The Agency claimed that it had carried out a standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the nearest flood sensor, around 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We have no surveillance data from Palu.
Therefore, we had to make a decision on the basis of the data we had," said Rahmat Triyono, Head of the Landquake and Cunami Centre of the BMKG.
The nearest floodmeter, measuring changes in the sea level, only identified a “insignificant” wave of six centimetres (2.5 inches) and did not notice huge waves near Palu.
“If we had a flood gauge near Palu or received data from Palu, the situation would, of course, be better.
We have to think about this in the future," said Triyon.
According to the officers, the cunami hit Palu and surrounding areas at a huge speed, hundreds of kilometres per hour, but it is not certain whether it happened before the warning was cancelled or later.
Residents check the beasts on the street looking for their family members after the cunami Palu, Indonesia, September 29, 2018.
“With the videos distributed in social media, we believe that the cunamis took place before the formal cancellation of the warning,” said Triyono.
The most damaged earthquake of 9.5 points took place on the second Christmas day of 2004 and caused a huge tsunami, killing about 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The impressive city of Palu, where 380 000 people live, is near the border of the Gulf in the northeast of the island of Sulaves.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (BNPB), the tsunami destroyed the city in 1927 and 1968.
According to the geophysical researcher of the University of Oxford in Baptist Gombert, the earthquake was not supposed to cause a tsunami.
On Friday, the earthquake was due to a horizontal fracture: the adjacent tectonic plates moved horizontally, not vertically, as usual for the tsunami.
“It is thought that the sea was a slope, a lot of water, and a tsunami,” he said and added that the force of waves moving towards the coast could be concentrated in a narrow Bay.
A representative of the Disaster Reduction Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told correspondents that his team “willing to send easily understandable public warnings” when the cunami warning was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Transport, text messages with warnings were repeatedly sent to citizens, but Nugroho claimed that the electricity and communication lines of the earthquake area were interrupted and there were no Syrians along the coast.
In the social media, the Indonesians questioned whether the BMKG had to revoke the cunami warning and misled the fact that the information was not provided in time.
“I am disappointed... The warning was cancelled... And the tsunami still happened...” – Twitter user @zanoguccy sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: Bollywood duo intends to kill ticket sales records
On Saturday, Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood have won four matches, and will probably be recorded in history, because representing Europe is already the leading result of 10:6 before the final of the Riga Cup.
Having won Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau the result of 5:4, they became the first couple of Europeans, winning all four maches.
Only Americans Larry Nelson and Lanny Wadkins managed to do so in 1979.
Throwing results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – do not show everything.
A couple three times won 14 important titles of Woods and twice won against Patrick Reed.
They also won the victory against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, this week's U.S. team that won three other competitions.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans who have won five points out of five possible.
Fleetwood has already earned most points in the Riga Cup of Units Competition as a newer European.
A couple named “Mollywood” by the multitude of new fans did not seem to be able to lead the European team forward from the first point of view.
The newest of the Ryder Cup, such as Fleetwood, is not expected to show up, and Molinaris was hit by none of the previous six matches and went down to four rivals.
However, there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, knows Le Golf National Square as his five fingers and here, in 2017, won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a determined temperament during this year U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion and many are considered the most consistent player of the European tournament – a useful feature in a thick square where a high grass can lead to destruction, as the American failure has shown.
These features of players and a harmonious game in the square made them incapable.
“I now feel a little feeling, but only Saturday,” said Fleetwood, a relaunching fascinating, playing with a wide smile inside all weekends.
This afternoon we were perfect and played stablely and well.
If we are together in history, this will be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we've tried for the team."
Molinari also rejoiced.
“It was great to play with Tommy,” he said.
"However, we must fulfil our obligation not only to enter the record books, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for the 4.5 point that we need to win; it will not be easy."
Rither's hot!
Ireland’s village has become a medieval battlefield
The castle of Claregalway in the western of Ireland was previously powerful, the main fortress of the 15th century family of English riter, and this Saturday was remembered of its origin.
Rither's two-fighting swords during the medieval fighting festival in Claregalway castle in Golvey, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
The yard of the house with the tower of a fully renovated English period was converted to the Middle Ages battle field, where many enthusiasts from all corners of the world restored contact fights and games that were popular many centuries ago.
Carl Dornan, dressed with Rither, and lifted the warrior's suit to pull Donna Dornan patrols in the great art of Claregalway castle during the Middle Ages Fight Festival in Golway, Ireland, September 29, 2018.
“This is a great weekend trip and something unusual,” the fighters say Denise Fitzgerald of Keer’s weekend, who became the host of the fountain.
“We returned to the simplest things.
I have tried to do everything as necessary," said the theatre's worker, who participated in the armed fighting festival for the first time.
In the field, the fighters armed in the face, and although their swords were buried, some helmets were folded, and one injured the lip.
Whistlemen demonstrated their skills by riding and cutting cabbage and abbreviations by half.
By the sides of the metal lying bitch guns, spice purchasers prepared medicines, and craftsmans cried and paint wool.
Seriously determined, and beautifully decorated, participants tried to feel in their roles.
“I think that anyone can wear the suit, but sensation in the role is art,” said Helena Stackpoole, who played Ice Eleanor Fitzgerald and had a unique opportunity to use his fashion design knowledge.
“All suits are handed out.
I've been sewing my belt for two years, and now I've been sewing a dress, and I wore 800 pearls on my hands alone.
It's important to me," she said.
After earthquake and tsunami, the number of deaths in Indonesia increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people who died after the earthquake and tsunami on the island of Indonesia has increased to 832 on Sunday and the affected area is higher than expected initially.
The agency's representative Sutopo Purwo Nugroho's news conference said that many people were stuck in the slopes after the 7.5 points of earthquake, which took place on Friday and caused a wave of six meters (20 feet) of tsunami.
FBI appealed to the second woman who accused the candidate Kavanaugh
The FBI agents investigating the case of a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court in Bretto Kavanaugh appealed to the second woman who accused him of sexual attack, which was disclosed on Sunday by the lawyer of this woman.
According to a report by Deborah Ramirez, attorney John Clune, the investigation of Kavanaugh’s case carried out by the FBI will not only cover the individual accusations of the attempt to rape the conservative of the Federal Court of Appeal Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, which was submitted this week at a dramatic meeting of the Senate.
Ramirez accuses Kavanaugh when she showed her her penis in a party, where she was drunk and which took place in a co-home of Jaly University when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trump submissed the pressure of the moderate Senate Republicans and ordered the FBI to conduct a study after a Thursday meeting of the Senate, in which Professor Ford of the University of California made a detailed accusation that Kavanaugh tried to rape her at a party held in 1982 when both of them were school students and teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News announced that the White House had limited the scope of the FBI investigation.
Shortly, he denied this and announced the Twitter message: “I really want them to listen to all the people they need at their own discretion.”
Representation of the White House Ray Shahas said that the Senate had determined the scope and duration of the FBI investigation (the study should be completed within a week).
“The White House allows agents to do what they are taught,” said Shahas.
The United Kingdom will not refuse environmental or animal protection standards after Brexito
Minister for the Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not refuse environmental or animal protection standards in order to enter into trade after Brexito.
British State Secretary for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove is coming to the Dauning Street in London, September 24, 2018.
Talking at the annual Conference of the Conservative Party, Gove said that it is useful for the United Kingdom to be aware of its quality foods and the government will publish a strategy for food this year.
Europe has recovered the Rider Cup in unit competitions
Francesco Molinaris earned glory on Sunday by returning the Rider Cup to Europe: the Italian won Phil Mickelson at the 16 pit and earned a point to achieve the required 14.5 results.
Mickelson subdued to the bouquet, having released the first ball into water, and the ridering area has become the first European who wins all five motors a week, although none of the previous six had a disaster.
Europe's victory has already been ensured that the Italian has launched a shock from the starting ground and the continent's victory has lacked one point, while Henry Stenson and Sergio Garcia have preceded the mach and were secure at least half a point.
At the beginning of the day, they first obtained 10:6 and had to earn four with half a point from possible 12 to recover trophies and strengthen their rule in the house that lasted since 1993.
Before this, the team managed only twice to remove the difference of four points and win unit competitions: this was done by the US team in Bruklinas and Europe in 2012 "Medinos miracle" competitions, but no one expected another stunning return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony Finau gave Yim Furyk's team the hope of winning the first matches, but then the European team's points were crossed throughout the square.
Thorbjorn Olesen tried Jordan Spieth, and his team's friend John Rahm-Tiger Woods: 14 important titles have lost four times out of four.
Ian Poulter, the best player in Ryder Cup, probably received most of the oocy this week, when the world's best player, Dastin Johnson, landed him in the 18th Rendering Park and brought Europe closer to the victory.
Then just had to wait for the first match to end, and it was the Molanar game that caused a joyful wave in the crowd, which was the largest in the history of the event.
RT World News: German police guarding Erdogan used the name of neonacio as a code word
According to the local media, secret officials in eastern Germany, who defended Turkish President Erdogan this week during his visit to Berlin, used the sad name of a famous neonatic extremist.
The Ministry of the Interior of the Region claimed that the criminal police of the land of Saxony located in the eastern Germany investigates two members of the SEK of the elite anti-terrorism team.
The men were designed to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long-awaited trip to Germany.
The officers had to work secretly, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a sad renowned neonac, a member of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) extremist group, who killed eight immigrants from Turkey at the beginning of this century, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media report that the modified code name has been discovered when two police officers have requested authorisation to access the internal documents necessary for the performance of the task.
The leaders prompted and cancelled the police.
Peter Kleine, the criminal police commander of Saxony, responded to the news first.
He said that the decision to use the name of Boehnhardt was “the most stupid ones, ” and so“ the victims and their loved ones who were clearly ignored. ”
Mr Roland Woller, Minister of the Interior of Saxony, approved this statement and called the decision "a scatter, terrible and totally unacceptable".
On Friday, Erdogan’s visit to Berlin led to many contradictory assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticised by accepting a manager accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel stated that this visit was very important, ‘for in the event of disagreement, they must be dealt with in a personal manner’.
The public first heard of the NSA in 2011, when Boehnhardt and his companion Uwe Mundlos were detected in the eastern German burned trailer.
It is believed that one of them killed another and then killed the bank in the city of Eizenach after a failed attempt to rob the bank.
The third member of the neonactical group, the last living remaining in Beate'a Zschaepe, was also arrested shortly.
In July of this year, the German court ordered her to be prisoned up to a live head for 10 accusations of murder.
She denied her contribution to the murders, but her lawyer said that the accused person felt morally guilty because she did not attempt to stop the murders.
Following the Scandal of the NSU, the German security agencies received many criticisms.
Lawyers, activists and victims believe that the group had much more companions.
It also appeared that the German Internal Intelligence Agency BfV has infiltrated a large number of informators into the NSA and has consistently prevented the investigation of group-related murders, attempts to kill and robbery.
Muscovy draws from Tesla's manager's duties and will have to pay $20 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to put him into the court for fraud in Twitter's messages, in which he claimed that he did Tesla's private company.
Muscle will have to leave the manager, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the agreement state that Musks must be removed from the office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tesla within 45 days and will be prohibited from returning to these posts for three years.
In addition, he will have to pay $20 million fine.
All started with the Twitter message, which was too cautious or intentionally written in misleading, so Musk will have to receive prior confirmation before someone says or declares the Tesla "in any format, including but not limited to social media (e.g. Twitter), the company's website (e.g. company's blog), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it did not check the Musk's original Twitter message.
In a complaint by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musku is accused of misleading investors in a letter from Twitter on 7 August, in which he claimed that he had found funds to make Tesla a private company with one share worth $420, which therefore cost more than 10 percent of the company's securities.
Muscovy soon took off his words by saying that Tesla will remain public, and he harassed investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that the Musk’s initial statement was “incorrect and misleading because it was not in fact”.
Mr Muskas himself explained in the blog that this error could be justified: after the meeting with the representative of the Saudi Arabian Independent Property Fund, he had the impression that he had succeeded in agreeing on the funds.
It is reported that Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission were closer to a softer sentence – Musk would have had to abandon its President's position for only two years and should not be recognised as guilty, but Musk refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell and, most likely, changed the opinion again and agreed to stricter conditions.
However, under the new agreement, like the old one, Musk does not need to recognise the guilty of investors' mislead.
Alexandria Patriarian committed to supporting the Canonian Ukrainian Church and called for orthodox unity
Alexandria Patriarian Theodor II declared on the basis of the Canonian Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which belongs to Moscow Patriarchat.
He spoke in response to the separation between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Constantinopoli patriarchate.
Theodor II arrived on Thursday in the city of Odessa in the south of Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and believers of orthodox.
The patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchies, which only deviates from the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinopolis.
“I came to tell you: do not refuse orthodox faith and canonic churches,” Patriarch Teodoras II said.
Before visiting Odessa, he met with the Polish Orthodox Church metropolite Savva, which also supports the Canonian Ukrainian Church.
They have also called for the prevention of conflicts arising from attempts to legitimise the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
“We will always support those who seek orthodox unity,” promised Theodor II.
The Orthodox Church has recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of the Constantinopoli patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox Church, also known as the Moscow Patriacht.
Constantinopolis decided to send exarchs to Kiev, thus violating the rule prohibiting one orthodox church from interfering with another.
Egzarchai is the special patriarch’s representatives, formally having a higher position than the metropolit Onufriy, who is the current Head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the patriarchate of Moscow.
Moscow’s patriarchate angryly reacted to the actions of Constantinopolis and cancelled all the common church worships and membership of organizations led or jointly chaired by the representatives of Constantinopolis.
However, it is claimed that Constantinopolis was ordered by this decision not to take any other hostile action and that the two churches were not considered to have completely ceased the bonds.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, the other church recognises only one – the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the patriarchat of Moscow.
Most Ukrainian clergyers recognise its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separated churches – the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Kiev Patriarchat, which was formed in the 1990s.
This religious movement has even a patriarched leader, Philareta, seeking official recognition of the Orthodox Church, full independence and equality with the Moscow Patriarchate.
Damascus first opened the main trading transition in Syria-Jordan for the first time in three years
According to the State News Agency, SANA, the Syrian Government claimed that it opened the Nasib border crossing with Jordan, which was closed for three years due to military action in this area.
This can be done because the fighters on the side of Syria abandoned the lands near the city of Daraaa.
Nasib is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf of Persia.
Key thoughts from the United Nations speech of Lavrov
At the visit of the UN Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov attacked the West for “political šantage and brutal forces” and said that diplomacy should not give up to dictate and unilateral sanctions.
The Minister at the UN General Assembly stated on Friday that some Western countries are putting pressure on others without conscience.
He did not name specific countries, but said that they used "political šantaž, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the self-conduct of a small group of countries.
Lavrov, who represented Russia in the United Nations for a decade, said at the meeting that diplomatic and negotiating culture is replaced by a dictate and unilateral sanctions which are applied without the agreement of the UN.
The Minister said that the sanctions imposed on many countries are "unlawful or ineffective" and recalled the US blockade for many years for Cuba.
“But history hasn’t taught us anything,” said Lavrov and added that “Wakarian supporters tend to make the guilt only if it is “very probable”.
We remember how often such unjustified accusations warranted interference and wars, such as the 1999 explosion in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion to Iraq and the 2011 Libyan intervention."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and recalled Syria’s seven - year war as one of the most recent cases.
Unable extremist attempts to turn Damascus's regime could have been devastating for the whole country and open up the possibility of establishing a "terrorist califat".
Lavrov praised the Astana peace process, which was launched jointly by Russia, Turkey and Iran, and said that this process helped prevent Islamic State (IS, previously known as ISIS) and other groups who wanted to take off Syria as a whole.
Now, the most important thing is to rebuild the country's disastrous places and help refugees to return home safely.
Lavrov returned to the battle of the great forces and said that the UN was actually founded “from the second world war. ”
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs recalled that in 2018, 80 years of the “fame” Munich Treaty signed in 1938, whereby France and Great Britain agreed to allow the Nazis to announce the German-populated part of Czechoslovakia to calm Hitler.
Although the then British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty “will bring peace to these times”, war began after a year.
"Miunchen's betrayal" shows how far "country self-egoism and ignorance of international law can lead", said Lavrov.
"The dictate and violence of the Colonia era must be used in the archive or trash of history."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, said Lavrov.
"If you have any questions or concerns, sit down and talk, reveal the facts, listen to the arguments of your colleague and try to reconcile interests."
Crisl's a strange eye?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are blurred and Bibi fingers on Iran
The Israeli Prime Minister said in the speech of the UN General Assembly that Tehran had secret nuclear weapons.
It may be that Israel, who is accusing others, hides something himself.
The favorite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed news on Thursday, showing from high photographs with places where Iran allegedly holds nuclear materials.
Tehran has long answered that Tel Aviv would rather take care of his “a programme of undeclared nuclear weapons. ”
Although Israel has never recognised (but has not denied) nuclear weapons, the RT journalist Murad Gazdieve tried to see if Tel Aviv should actually search for a log in his eye.
Scotland Government: no complaints against Alexo Salmondo have been made before January
The Scottish Government stated that no complaints concerning Alex Salmond had been brought before January of this year.
Two accusations against sexual harassment against the former first minister in January, although he strongly denies them.
He was informed of the investigation in March.
Salmond, who has resigned from the Scottish National Party, will be litigating with the Scottish Government on the appeal process against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been lodged by January.
A representative of the Scottish Government said: “The Scottish Government received two complaints concerning Alex Salmond in January.
We were able to ignore them or hide them.
Earlier then, the Deputy Minister of First Minister received no complaints about Alex Salmond and, as we said, the first minister heard for the first time about the investigation from Alex Salmond in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legitimacy of our processes and will insist on defending our position.
The Scottish Government will try to get as much information as possible within the time available.
However, as we have already said, we cannot now comment more on Mr Salmond's case for legal reasons."
Alexo Salmond's representative said: “We will not comment, because our petition before the Permanent Secretary is now being dealt with at the hearing and we hope that a decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk to the court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government’s complaint against Alex is illegal."
Glass tricked the result of Dragon 29:13: Warriors player Lee Jones spurt
Glazg has recovered the title of winners in the Guinness Pro14 league by earning extra points and winning Dragons Scotstoun Stadione, while coach Dave Rennie doesn't hide satisfaction, but thinks that the game could have been more accurate.
After the unexpected loss of the South Kings team in Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie asked for a lot of changes in teams, and although she managed to gather the necessary points to stay at the top of the A conference, the games played by windy and rainy weather were certainly not smooth.
“I think we defended perfectly this evening, we played on the right side of the square and our strategy was good,” Rennie said.
“We have to play more precisely and have been able to use more opportunities.
The conditions were unfavourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are pleased to do so.
It is necessary to play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points earned today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We have won extra points, but next week we need to make more effort to play with Zebre and next week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the air was winded, the Glazgo team began to earn points early, but the TMO captured all the balls lost by Huwo Jones, including the inner transfer of Niko Matawalu in the left corner.
The frustration lasted for a long time: the left column of Oli Kebble started in the middle of the fourth minute, and Adam Hastings easily caught the casting.
Dragons reduced the difference when Arwel Robson received a fine, while the safety of the next player immediately after the 20-minute mark and the Velseans earned a point.
After a relatively calm first side of the relay, the Glasgow attackers consistently attacked the Dragons line, and then the judge from South Africa, Stuart Berry, sentenced the Velseans for 22 minutes on the side of Hastings.
Warriors went into the ruins, but lost the ball after a smooth transmission, because the left edge of Matawalu, having several impacts, could not control the ball and it was transferred to the left.
The second test was carried out two minutes after the interval: Hastings crashed the Dragons line and wisely transferred the ball to run down Lee Jones.
The ball was returned to Hastings' position, and the result of the matches in the middle became 12:6.
The first minute of the second side of glazing was very successful: Lee Jones received the ball of Alex Dunbar for the second test, and Hastings helped him.
However, Warriors did not give up after failure – just four minutes later, they took the ball in the middle of the square, and the Dragons center, Adam Warren, took it off under the gate, earning points, and later took Josha Lewis after an open game with Robson.
Warriors quickly returned to the leading position and earned additional points 54 minutes after the fourth test, when Huwa Jones fled right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (this was the third failure from the four tests).
Glazg kept a comfortable higher position and carried out the fifth test a few minutes ago – Dunbar passed the ball after the rumors with George Horne, and Hastings earned points.
Kebble was announced as the best match player, but Rennie praised Hastings.
“They obviously hampered us to play, but we opened up at the middle,” the coach said.
“It was short of a few meters, but it was slippery and still managed to distance.
He's a good form and trusts himself."
Ayr United won Morton score 1:5: Five stars Ayr tried the host team
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore earned two spells, and Declan McDaid added another one to help Ayr stay at the top of the championship table.
Ayr went forward after Shankland's turn, attacked from six yards after Michael Rose's corner attack on McDaid.
In the 35th minute of the first test, Morton evened the result when Charlie Telfer took the ball from the dual Robbie Crawford in his own place and sent him through Ayr’s gateman Ross Doohan to the distant land.
Players from Grinok had the chance to go forward in the fourth minute of the second chair when Doohan turned Gary Oliver, but Michael Tidser released a weak fine that the consumer easily caught.
Ayr's 74-minute second blown rivals when the transfer of the long distance of the replacement Craigo McGuffie was humiliated in the air and the fall on the ground was sent to the gate of another alternate player Craigo Moore.
Moore transferred the ball to Shankland for the same minute, which took 17 holes this season.
When the fans shot, Moore returned to his half a quarter from the edge of the site, and McDaid sent a jumping ball to the gate.
"Alloa" and "Falk" match ended with the result 0:2: first victory of young people in the league
"I'm glad, I feel a relief, I'm happy," said Ray McKinnon, after the very necessary first Falkirk victory in the league and the earned season points.
Rangers' borrowed attacker Zakas Rudden (18 years) earned a chance in both chairs and pushed the host team Alloa Athletic into the bottom of the championship and freed the club from pressured troubles.
“We have been an important game,” acknowledged McKinnon.
“We probably deserve more during the last three competitions, so it was great to earn three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It wouldn't have led to anything, but it was important for us to win."
In the 26th minute, the autumn sent the ball to Patrick Brough and earned a speculation from the gate line in the middle of the second crane, when Deimantas Petravičius slowly knocked the ball over the gate of Neil Parry.
“We wanted to defend ourselves firmly but failed,” admits the Head of Wasps, Jimas Goodwinas.

Royal archives and music „Hamiltonas” creators shine the world about King Jurgis III
After the queen presented a project opening a huge archive of documents collected during the year of the management of Jurgio III, it was hoped that letters, blogs and languages would help the public to know much better the king considered as a wizard.
Now these documents will reach a different audience – the Royal Archives completely unexpectedly decided to cooperate with the Vestendo Music.
Academics who wished to reveal the real face of the king invited Jurgis III, a musical actor, “Hamiltonas”, to the library of the Palace of Vindzor, to review the most important documents from the times of management of the queen propropropropersenel.
Researchers are trying to make old manuscripts accessible to the wider audience, so a large crowd of fans of performance will be able to access digital documents.

Michael Jibson, who plays the kings in Vestende, said that the documents made it difficult to meditate and helped to know the king whose image was made by the musicians “Hamiltonas”, the film “Karal Jurgio madness” and the series of children “Free stories”).
"We loved after beautiful letters"
U.S. President Donald Trump didn't name enthusiasm after attempting to reduce tension with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Unu and said on Saturday in his supporters' meeting that after correspondence, they both “sleeped. ”
Mr Trumpas and Mr Kiimas said that they would pursue the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting that took place this year in Singapore.
Before moving to a new stage of history after many years of public disagreement, the leaders of the countries have changed their threats and offenses because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the US.
“I was strict as he did.
We were continually deceived," Mr. Trumpas said at the congregation in Western Virginia.
“ And then we fell in love, you know?
Indeed, he wrote me beautiful, fine letters."

Square crossing for the Shimonite: everything decided by the party 'sweet'
Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says that there was a lack of democracy in the internal elections of conservatives, and the party's leadership has actually appointed Ingrid Schonyte as presidential candidate.
"The celebration of the 'democracy itself' was, however, strange, gentlely speaking, when the party cream, the peak decided and actively supported one candidate.
Probably the second candidate had no chance to win even theory," S. Skvernelis said to journalists in the Government
"The conservatives have appointed their candidate, and we welcome them," the Prime Minister added.
The posted Prime Minister of the Greens said that I. Simonyte should evaluate the voters, remembering her work in the Government of Andriaus Kubilis.
Mr Skvernelis does not comment on whether he or she will participate in the presidential elections.
The Union of Lithuanian Peasants and Greens intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader Ramūnas Karbauskis called the election of conservatives of the leading "nationals" as a "unsuccessful experiment" due to the low activity of the partyes.
"Since we have to congratulate the experiment, which has absolutely failed.
Only 55% of the members of the party participated, with a total of just around 20 thousand voters.
Knowing what money had to be spent to organise these elections, it is quite clear that this has not been justified," Mr Karbauskis said to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I think that the costs will not justify the result, because the result is nothing, the party decided that their candidate is like this - all right, but to whom to spend so much money," he added.
During the internal elections on the weekend, 79 % of the members and their supporters of the Conservatives voted in favour of the nomination of Mrs Schimonyte.
Lithuanian salaries ridicule Estonians: one area can change everything
The Baltic Salary Survey, which is organizing the remuneration surveys this year, has shown that wages increased mainly in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have lagged behind from their neighbour, reports the company's press release.
"With a survey of 850 companies and a study of wage developments in the Baltic States, we see that monthly pre-tax wages in Lithuania increased by 81.8% of employees this year and increased on average by 7.7% and annual wages with annexes by 10.5%.
Latvia has slightly circumcised us - there has been a little more annual salary, but, like Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," says Povilas Blusius, a representative of the company organizing the salary investigations, and adds that in the event of such wage growth trends, the general economic indicators of the country should also be taken into account, which dictates them.
In Estonia, wages grew fastest
Although in Latvia and Estonia wages increased to a lower proportion of employees than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, annual wages grew by 71% of the employees of the surveyed companies and reached a little more than 11 percent in our country.
This year, in Estonia, wages rose by 73% of workers and increased by 13 percent on average.
Worker change also has a significant impact on wage growth, as changing jobs can receive much higher remuneration than in previous jobs.
For those who have not changed their place of employment in Lithuania in recent years, the annual salary has increased by 8.8% - it is more often than in other Baltic countries as well.
In the neighbouring Latvia, the annual increase in remuneration for such employees was only 3.6%.
Estonia remains the leader in the Baltic States not only as the average of the highest wage for new, but also for long-term workers.
For those who did not change their jobs or duties, wages have risen most quickly here: monthly - 6%, annually, including annexes - even 9%.
According to the remuneration investigator, these trends often depend on whether they go hand in hand with the general economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy, prevailing market moods.
For example, the forecast of the coming economic difficult years encourages business to be more cautious and less invested.
The predominant and fastest growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals, can also develop general statistics and overwhelm smaller changes.
The largest tax burden on Latvians
It is also important to take into account the different tax systems in these countries when comparing wage growth.
In Latvia, employees pay most of their taxes depending on their remuneration - even 31 or 34%, which can increase to 42,4 percent for more earners.
For example, in Lithuania there is a constant rate of 24%, so at higher salary growth in Latvia, employees can experience the same or even lower apparent gains than in Lithuania.
Estonia is subject to a similar tax rate to 23,6 percent in Lithuania, so we find the most favourable labour taxation in the Baltic States.
IT - Competitive wages
According to the survey, in all Baltic countries, almost regardless of the level of duties, IT professional positions remain among the best paid.
The opposite situation in retail trade is one of the lowest market indices for positions in this area, making employees earn lower than the average of the market.
Compared to the previous year, the fastest wages grew for engineering professionals with higher positions, as well as risk management professionals.
This increase in remuneration did not go beyond some IT positions this year - a significant proportion of organisations' information security professionals increased monthly salaries to up to 14 percent.
Meanwhile, retail wages did not change.
However, some companies have successfully carried out reorganisations of remuneration systems, which resulted in an annual wage increase of around 2 percentage points for bonuses.
According to remuneration specialists, there is a tendency that wage growth dictates the demand of the most demanding specialists - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: the former inclined does not stop laughing
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson pours out his pain by creating jokes about their two relationships.
By participating in the Saturday Night Live, he chose to joke about how too fast it blows into serious relationships.

Pete has tried to create scenarios that mention his unsuccessful relationships, but this will happen in the screens a little later.
A humorist, who was in his former relationship, is jealous of Arian himself.
Such jokes are painful to her, and not to her heart.
At least such a foreign news portal, TMZ was told by secret sources.
White or brown: what sugar to choose is recommended by a dietist
White or brown?
Which sugar will be chosen?
During the survey at the shopping centres, it was found that although Lithuanians still traditionally choose white sugar, it is amazing that many nationals refuse this white-minded ingredient at all.
That the sales of brown sugar are not concealed by the representatives of the marketing networks.
According to "Maximos" representative, brown sugar is becoming increasingly popular and the people buy it more, although normal, white sugar - according to the choice is still older.
Sales of organic sugar are also growing and specialized in organic product stores.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to dietist Dalia Vaitkevičiūtė, the main difference is the price, and the harmful health effects can be both.
"The unrefined sugar is three-fold more expensive, but from a health point of view these sugars are multiplying and their surpluses are harmful to the body," said Mr Vaitkevičiūtė.
To live without sugar, the dietist recommends that the amount of sugar be reduced gradually in everyday life.
This - the benefits of all - will fall and unwanted kilograms, and health will also improve.
A month's consistent consumption of less sugar will also make it easier for it to be abandoned at all.
'Every habit we are forming about a month's time, so when we have such an experiment, let's say, a month's time for drinking some product without sugar - coffee or tea, we will see how positive this will happen and I think that everyone can abandon a little bit of effort,' the advice on how to give up sugar was given by an ideologist.
Doctors claim that white sugar is not unduly mentioned as a cause for confusion, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
Therefore, it is worth trying to reduce its consumption, because this product is added to many foods, even in bread.
Another step of "Lietuvoskabelis": Lipkevičius borrows to another LKL crew
The team of Panevėžys "Lietkabelis" greeted Vytenas Lipkevičis - the attacker is borrowed by Prienai "Skycop" crews.
During this Betsafe-LKL season, V.Lipkevičius dropped 6.4 points within 22 minutes, returned 2.8 balls, performed 2 results of transmissions and selected 8.5 performance points.
FIBA Champions League 29 years 198 cm height athlete statistics reached 3.8 points, 2.5 retro-reflected ball, 1.5 results of transmission and 4.8 performance points within 21 minute of the game.
In the near future, "Lietkabelis" will publish a new purchase that will strengthen its composition.
S.Buškevic joined the training team
The chief coach of Panevėžys "Lietuvoskabelis" team Nenadas Čanakas has become an assistant of Lithuanians well-known Sandis Buškevics.
The 41-year-old Latvians played in the 2005-2006 season in Vilnius "Lithuania morning", while in 2014-2017 they worked in the club system as a coach assistant.
In the previous season, S.Buškevick trained the team of Jēkabpils.
Sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Stepon Babrausk to the station, but he is going to continue the basketball career.
The invitation was also received by Vytenis Jasikevičius, but there was no agreement between both sides.
S.Buškevic will work together with Robert Kuncait and Algimantas Bružu in the "Lithuaniankabelis" trener station.
Latvia will join "Lithuanian Cabinel" on Tuesday and will be in "Cido" Arena through FIBA Championship League matches with the Grand JDA, but we will not leave it on the choir, because the registration ended 24 hours before the start of the game.
A reduction in the price of biofuels will not be expected for all
In 2019, more leaf trees will be crossed in Lithuania in order to reduce the prices of biofuels, says the Minister of the Environment.
According to Kęstutis Navickas, this is what we want to 'impact' the prices of biofuels.
"We have a large stock of certain species.
We have to balance (...).
Concentration in soft leaves is, as this can also affect the prices of biofuels," K. Navickas said on Tuesday, presenting the situation of cutting forests.
According to K. Navicko, the price of wood in Lithuania increased by about 20% this year.
According to the Minister, next year the pine trees will be cut as much as this year and the trees will be about 80 hectares less.
According to him, in Lithuania, wood is cut more due to favourable natural conditions.
"In other years it should not be," said Mr Navick.
Now 10.2 million hectares of forests are public and 800 thousand hectares are private.
Fighting food prices - a doubtful obligation: will encourage purchases in your area only
Among the measures presented by the Ministry of Economy to reduce prices, the proposed obligation for public bodies and organisations to buy 50 % of food from local producers is published by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The law would be applicable not only to small traders operating in regions, but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, local companies that have won competitions could supply printing services or catering goods to the buyer in municipalities," Minister of Economy Virginijus Sinkevičius said to the portal.
Egidijus Mockevičius, President of the meat processor association, has no doubt that this provision would discriminate against some entrepreneurs, and it would be difficult to control whether the law is not being used by the resellers.
The measure is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation Valdas Sutkus.
Macron urges Europe to defend against Russia and the USA
The French President Emmanuel Macron called for the creation of a "real European army" to ensure protection from Russia and even the United States
Mr Macron, who has come to power since he has called for the creation of common forces in the European Union, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on American military power.
He has recently gained a strong argument after the US President Donald Trump declared that Washington would withdraw from the important Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Forces.
"We must protect ourselves from China, Russia and even the United States," Mr Macron said to the radio Europe 1.
This was the first interview on his radio from the beginning of his office in May 2017.
'When I see President Trump declares that he draws from an important disarmament agreement created after the rocket crisis in Europe in the 1990s, which will be the main victim? - Europe and its security,' said the French leader.
The above-mentioned missile crisis was caused by the non-strategic development of nuclear weapons in the end of the Cold War, through which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a key factor for the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude the Middle Range Nuclear Force Treaty (INF) in 1987.
'We will not protect Europeans unless we decide to have a genuine European army,' said Mr Macronas, an interview recorded on Monday evening in Verdene in north-east France, President of the First World War Fights this week before the 100th anniversary of the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macrono, in the situation, 'when Russia, which is at our borders, has shown its potential threat... we need a Europe that is better defended by itself than simply dependent on the United States'.
The French leader has become the main initiator of the project to set up forces from nine European countries that can quickly organise a joint military operation, evacuation from the war zone or to provide assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
The defence ministers of these nine countries will meet in Paris for the first time on Wednesday to discuss details on how these forces will work.
The European Union also intends to significantly increase its defence budget from 2021 onwards and allocate around EUR 13 billion to research and development in seven years.
The current EU defence budget is below EUR 600 million.
However, Professor Bruno Alomaras, professor of the French Military School, said that the vision of Ms Macron on a closely united European defence is difficult to implement.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad," he said to the news agency AFP.
- However, there is a huge gap between the defences of Europe, which Emmanuel Macron is dreaming of, and reality - very large disagreements between European partners."
Lukashenka NATO exploded by missiles: we're not idiots
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenka stated on Tuesday that his country would need new arms if NATO continued to concentrate forces at the western wall of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be frightened by deploying the bases in Poland or something else, Belarus will need a more effective weapon, in particular rockets", the public news agency Belta quotes the words of A. Lukashenko, a group of American analysts in Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its own rocket manufacturing industry.
'Recently - you have noticed, and we do not conceal - we have created our rocket industry and have produced our very precise (destructive) rocket weapons,' the President stressed.
Last week, Lukashenka stated that Minsk and Moscow are looking for an appropriate and costly response to plans to build a base in Poland and name it to the Honor of the US President Donaldo Trump (Donaldo Trampo) "Trumpo fortu" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, we're worried about it.
If, for example, in Poland they declare that they are ready to spend millions of dollars to deploy (...) some short fort, of course we are not idiots and, of course, we respond to it," said Mr Lukešenka, in attending the discussions of the main group of the Munich Security Conference in Minsk.
"Suspected, with our main ally (Russia) we are discussing how to answer all of this and how to find an appropriate response to the minimum costs," he added.
DOB: 29.9.1970
Their relationships are also the subject of Moscow's role in the Syrian conflict and the fight in Great Britain this year, as is believed to be the attempt by the Russian Special Services to poison the former dual agent Sergey Crypale nervous paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington exacerbated even more in October after the short announcement that he intends to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this step could destroy the security system in the world.
The deadly executed man revealed the killing of his wife's raped footballer
Brazil was drowned by a cruel crime in which this country's football player Daniel Correa Freitas was cruelly executed.

I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
And I saw Daniel, who was naked in bed, and my wife, who asked for help.
I was deadly immortal.
With my friends in the party, we pulled him out into the car.
This is where I had a knife with which my wife, who was raped, was dying.
I was very evil, I couldn't do anything for myself at that moment," said the murderer.
Together with his friends he throwed the dead footballer's body near the river, where police officers were looking for the main crap of the crime tool.
The civil Brazilian police arrested Junior, his wife and his holy daughter on birthday.
It is claimed that police officers who investigate the event still lack evidence that a woman was raped during the party.
True, recently distributed last footballer messages and pictures at WahtsApp opportunity can help the research.
The footballist sent two photos to one of his friends through "WhatsApp" in which he embraced himself in bed, next to a sleeping woman, who, as the wife of the killer Cristiana appeared later.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in various home rooms.
I'll eat the mother of the cookie, although her father is somewhere nearby," the footballist wrote to his friend.
Daniel Correa Freitas, who belongs to the Sao Paulo club, has been lent in this season to the second power matching "Sao Bento" in the Brazilian league.

Alabama "Hurts" can no longer use the suspension option
Alabama's backup player Jalen Hurts will no longer be able to be suspended for this season after this Saturday.
Hurts has been included in the "Crimson Tide" Saturday match against the weaker Luiziana team, and this is the fifth player's match this season.
This year, the NCAA has applied a new rule – to suspend a player in four matches.
This month, Athletic announced that Hurts was planning to do this because of the contradictory introduction of evaluations and the response of team coach staff to them.
Tua Tagovailoa changed Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Crimson Tide coach Nick Sabanas said that he still plans to use Hurts' skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabam to enter the match on the national championship against the Georgeian team, but the second half was replaced by Tagovailoa, contributing to Crimson Tide victory score 26:23.
The former attacker of the South East conference, Hurts, started the last 28 Alabama's matches and entered the season with record – 26:2.
In Saturday competitions, Hurts completed 22 out of 31 transmissions during the first four episodes of Crimson Tide, ran 276 yards, four times earned points and took the ball once.
He also fled 15 times with the ball and fled 54 yards.
Owens: Dess must immediately sign a contract
Former attacker of Dalas “Cowboys” Dez Bryant said that he will soon return to the NFL.
Terrella Owens, a member of the Museum of Slova, said that Bryant would be more forced to do so immediately.
In response to the question asked on Twitter when he intends to sign a contract with the team, Bryantas announced on Friday a message from one word "Twitter": "Not soon."
Three times selected to the Pro Bowl match, Bryant does not belong to any team since Dalas Cowboys refused in the middle of April in the event of a dispute on remuneration.
Bryantas, who may have refused the contract with Baltimore Ravens and is constantly associated with Cleveland Browns, said just before the season, that he wants to improve before signing the contract with the team.
In August, Owens, who came to the museum of professional American football glory, still talking about returning to NFL, TMZ said to the site that Bryant should try to return to sport as soon as possible.
“He must join the team and prove everything he can,” said Owens.
“All investigators think that he is no longer angry, and he is no longer as good as he thinks.
Now he must enter the team for any salary, accept one or two years of contract – this is absolutely not important – and show everyone what he can do."
In 2017 Bryantas Dalas team caught the ball 69 times, ran 838 yards and six times earned points.
In 29 years, the player did not escape 100 yards in his longest career – 23 competitions.
By signing a five-year $70 million contract in 2015, Bryantas did not flee 1000 yards for any season and received more than eight points of balls.
“If the Director-General or the owner assumes that your skills are deteriorating, you will not be able to secure or collect the amounts you want”, Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryant had to get to the team as soon as possible, as it could later fail at all and said that it would be possible to return to Cowboys in difficult times.
“Only known. I don’t know if their relationship would be damaged,” said Owens, who 38 times earned points for three seasons playing in the Dalas team.
"I think that in the case of Dez, if Cowboys accepts it back and will be able, it will be useful for Dez and franchise."
Suggested on the establishment of CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania
In Kaunas last week, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN) appreciate the possibility of setting up a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe in which companies receive support for the commercialisation of CERN technologies, the development of innovative products and their adaptation to public needs.
Although Lithuania has only become a member of CERN last year, the establishment of the business incubator of this organisation in the country has already been on board.
CERN representatives visited Kaunas University of Health Sciences (LSMU) and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) Institutes of Material Science and Biomedical Engineering in Santakos Valley.
The guests of the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC) together with KTU, LSMU, Vytautas Magnus University, Lithuanian Institute of Energy, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy, and business representatives discussed Kaunas's innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, since if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on scientific and business innovation in the region.
"This incubator would encourage CERN's knowledge and technology to be adapted to solve important problems, such as new technologies and artificial intelligence, for diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and for the processing of large data," says Dr. Leonas Balaševičius, KTU's research and innovation proactor.
CERN incubators, like other new business development centres, provide support for the development of business – provide information and expert advice on the adaptation of technologies in product development and help to find sources of funding.
The difference is that CERN incubator is more science.
This centre includes experts in various fields in Lithuania: specialists in information technology, materials engineering, as well as in the field of medicine.
The CERN is best known for the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in Switzerland, the LHC, The Large Hadron Collider.
However, CERN is carried out not only in quantitative mechanics but also in other areas, from cryogenics (high cold exposure to substances) to particle monitoring and radiation studies.
These technologies and the work carried out by scientists have an impact on many areas of public interest: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilniaus burner" has a new guide
The drink manufacturer AB "Vilniaus degtinė" appointed Rok Mituz, a new director-general, who will replace Raimonda Pilkė in these duties.
Since last year, Mr. Pilkė, leading the summer company, continues to act as the financial director of "Vilniaus degtinė", according to a report distributed through "Nasdaq" Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mituza is the co-founder of the company "Buga LT" making sauces, indicated in his "LinkedIn" account.
In 2012-2017 Mituza took office as director of regions in the SPI Group, previously working in Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever groups.
The "Vilniaus degtinė" ended in the first quarter of this year with a loss of EUR 315.500.
Last year, the company earned a profit of EUR 392.300 during the relevant period.
The company's excise sales income was EUR 4.956 million and decreased by 13.16% compared to the first quarter of the previous year.
"Vilniaus in the vodka" employs more than 100 people.
STT arrested R. Ača - Business news
Former parlamentar and former director of the Raseinių rajono municipal administration Remigijus Ačas are suspected of being bribed.
He's detained.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) reports that officials of the Šiauliai Board are carrying out pre-trial investigations on possible corruption in the municipality of Raseiniai district.
"R. A. (Remigijus Ačas - red. past.) is suspected by bribery.
The circumstances of the untransparent procurement are examined, while R. A. takes the office of the director of the municipality, a possible exceptional favour for one private company to conclude a public procurement contract with a company managed by the municipality of Raseiniai.
It is suspected that Mrs A accepted a large bucket (more than 250 MGL) for this", says the STT press report.
BNS adds that this company is the Race Bus Park.
On Monday, officials also detained the alleged leader of Raseinių savivaldybės "Raseinių autobusų parkas" Vladislovas Šiaitis.
This was confirmed by the STT's representative, Renata Andružytė.
The STT report also states that the suspicions were raised by two representatives of companies who directly bought Mr Ača or participated in the masking of the buckets in various financial operations.
All suspects are detained, their workplaces and their home crashes.
Founded membership of LSDD
Remigijus Ačas was a director of the Raseinių rajono municipal administration for some time, but in April, if the Council disagreed with his report, he lost these duties.
He was also the mayor of this district in 2011-2012. Ponas Ačas, a long-term member of the Seimas, has been elected to Parliament since 2004 as a candidate of the party 'Proceedings and Justice'.
However, in 2013 his roads with this party were separated, and in 2016 the Seimas elections failed to combat his own mandate.
Now Mr. Ačas depends on the separation of social democrats and the newly established Lithuanian Social Democrat Labour Party (LSDD), led by Gediminas Kirkilas.
Shortly after this news appeared, the President of LSDD Kirkilas informed the press that Mr Ačas suspended membership of the party until the investigation took place.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions expressed by Remigius Ačui are an unpleasant surprise for us, but in all cases the law enforcement must take all the necessary steps to find out the truth.
Mr Ačas temporarily suspended membership of the party until the pre-trial investigation takes place," says LSDD leader Kirkilas.
In 2003, Achas was the head of the advisor group of the then President Roland Pax, who was subsequently expelled from office through the conviction on national security issues.
Mayor A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of Mr Ačo
Neither mayor of Raseiniai district Algirdas Gricius nor the current head of the municipal administration Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS said on Monday without any information on which specific procurement may be involved in law enforcement investigations.
Mayor Gricius said about Mr Ačo's detention after learning from the media.
'I can't just say, we were very limited by the functions, I was as a mayor in my work, he (R. Ačas - BNS) - the work of the administration, and I couldn't tell you, either for what reasons or for what reasons the public procurement was done,' the BNS said on Monday.
He also claimed that, for the same reasons, he would not want to assess the former management of Mr Ačo to the municipal administration.
I would be afraid to say something that I could evaluate his activities, because I did not directly control the work of his administration as far as I was presented on the subject of public procurement, on the subject of competitions, said that such and such public procurement, such competitions, then who was visible in the public space, concluded contracts, that I have already seen as a mayor.
I cannot therefore describe how he led the administration at the time as its director," Mr Gricius said.
He said that he did not intervene in public procurement and did not influence it.
Team of the Minister of Culture - a new advisor

He will advise on archives, libraries, museums and the management of cultural heritage.

By the way, in 2017 students from the Faculty of Communication of VU elected Mr. Blažiūnas as the best teacher of the Faculty.
The new ministerial advisor is the author of many scientific articles on the conservation of cultural heritage and values.
Klaita does not stop
VŽ recalls that in May this year, the Team of Minister of Culture Ruokytė-Jonsson was left by advisor Dr. Viktoras Bachmetjevas, who advised the Minister of Public Information Policy, and was also responsible for media literacy and strategic communication.

He was responsible for cultural heritage, archives, museums and libraries.
Then Mr Ruokytė-Jonsson said that her new Deputy Minister will fuel the same areas as Mr Augustinavičius.
Currently, in addition to Augustinavičius, the area is created by Mr Blažiūnas, the ministerial adviser team consists of Rita Grumadaitė, Evaldas Stankevičius, Egidijus Gailiūnas, Rusnė Rinkevičienė and Eglė Saudargaitė.
S. Gentvilas: 90 million euro fines are threatened by the inactive GPAIS business
The Vice-President of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection Simon Gentvilas says that the poorly functioning information system for product, packaging and waste accounting (PSPS) may require fines of almost 90 million euros to be paid to Lithuanian producers and importers at the end of the year.
"According to the end of the year and the GPAIS system without the start of normal operation, the systemic crisis in the packaging sector is becoming an increasingly realistic scenario.
It is informal that the certificates confirming the recovery of packaging waste have been issued only 1% of the intended recycling tasks," Mr Gentvilas states in the press report.
On 7 November the Seimas initiated an extraordinary meeting of the Committee on the Environment, which intends to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not functioning, why the programme module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without taking into account the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, manufacturers and importers are at risk and again receive huge environmental taxes at the end of this year," says Mr Gentvilas.
In his view, the shortcomings and failure of the GPAIS accounting system signal the serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared with the Metrail crisis.
Anxiety on tasks
Some experts are also warned of the fact that some of the companies may fail to fulfil the State-defined recycling tasks for packaging waste in 2018.
The first half of the year's reprocessing indicators published by the organisations, the specialists confirm that there is a reason to worry that part of the organisations may fail to manage the required quantity of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, some companies may no longer be able to benefit from the exemption from the pollution tax and would receive an emission tax on a certain amount of their annual marketable packaging.
The CCI wrote that two of the three existing producer organisations rejected such concerns and one did not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, the Director-General of the VšĮ Green Point, said that at least formally, the success of the tasks depends on the resolution of product, packaging and waste information system (APAIS) problems.
The Green Point plans this year to overcome the tasks of handling all types of packaging, except glasses.
Although the Green Point glass task will not be overcome this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses that will result from it.
Experts question the benefits of food coupons
When the government intends to share coupons with less deprived people with food, thus encouraging family or farmer trade, experts are questioning the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that the new system would create an additional bureaucratic burden.
Marius Dubnikovas, Head of the Tax Commission of the Lithuanian Confederation of Business, says that the coupons have survived and the problem has not been resolved and the government should focus on increasing human income.
"The system looks quite strange and as if it was taken from older manuals.
If we want to help the public to acquire something or have more purchasing power, we need to channel all capacity to how to increase people's income, and people must decide whether to buy in one or another shop," Mr Dubnikovas said.
According to him, the Government would apply food coupons to people with lower incomes.
"It is obviously applicable to people with lower incomes, as if a voucher on the pallet, on which it would be written, we, this government, gave you a voucher, and be in favour of us.
It sounds like certain pre-election promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly to them," the analyst said.
According to him, the food coupon system will require additional investment and will increase the administrative burden because it will need to monitor what and how it allows them to protect them from fraud.
The Swedbank chief economist Nery Mačiulis says that the two objectives - to support low-income residents and small entrepreneurs - cannot be achieved with one instrument.
"If it is support for small entrepreneurs, the aid of vouchers compensates price differences and the population can buy more expensive goods in smaller shops, the price difference is compensated by the State from the budget.
Then it is support for business, but not support for the population," Mr. Mačiulis said.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not substantially alter the competitive position of small shops, but would create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it difficult for new market participants to enter.
"It is like that it would be a rather bureaucratic instrument with high administrative costs, and the population would also be quite uncomfortable, they should not buy in some bigger shop with a larger range closer to home, but look for several specialised shops with a smaller range," said the economist.
According to it, in other countries, coupons are used when the volume of goods or services is limited and must be provided to all in the same way, or some kind of social group.
The population then receives coupons for free and can issue them for food.
According to Mr Mačiuli, they are also used in the labour market by providing temporary tax incentives for businesses, the recruitment of long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
This practice, Mr Mačiulis, has been successfully applied in Lithuania.
Prime Minister Saul Skvernelis said on Monday that the new food coupon system discussed by the Government would help the poorest people, increase competition, promote small traders or farmers' business.
Prime Minister Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and customers with coupons could get a discount of 20-30%.
According to him, the number of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not misuse them.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow people to benefit from EUR 10-15 per month.
According to him, although the budget for the programme is not yet available, it could be financed from this source, perhaps from the European Union funds.
"Not everything that is currently foreseen or unforeseen in the budget will be final, yet he will change in the Seimas, so happens, may be funds from one line to another, and from the ministries, may exchange matters of funding.
There is always a priority, a decision - whether or not to give up, finding another additional source of income, and so on," Mr Malinauskas said on Tuesday.
The extent to which and from when innovation can be applied is currently being decided.
