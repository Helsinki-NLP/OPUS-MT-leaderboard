28 years old cooking found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week a dead 28-year-old cooking was found in a supermarket's staircase, which recently moved to San Francisco.
But the brother says he can't imagine anyone who would like to hurt his brother, stating that: "He life finally began to improve."
The lean found at the Vestfield supermarket was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, said a representative of San Francisco’s medical expertise office.
The San Francisco police declared his death to be murdered and currently being investigated.
Brother Luis Galicia tells the San Francisco broadcasting ABC KGO that Frank had previously worked as cook in Boston, but six months ago he was at his dreams at the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the message about his death shocked them and struck them.
"We are a small team working as a family united and we're going to miss him very much," said the representative.
In this difficult time, we will think with Frank's friends and family.
Louis Galicia says that at the beginning Frank was in hostiles, but in recent times his life has finally improved.
"He went into a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the radio station to KGO.
Louis Galicia claims that he does not know who would like to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a broad heart.
"He always educated his family by preparing a delicious meal and cooking lunch," said Louis Galicia
He never wanted to engage in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Because of everything that went wrong in the world, he was like a rough diamond that brightly flashed every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New doctor strike: calls for new protests
The representatives of the new doctors are asking their trade union to initiate protests in the dispute on the new contract.
The New Doctor Committee (JAC) of the British Medical Association (LMA) intends to ask the Council to support more extensive protests at the beginning of September.
The JAK considers that ministers have failed to resolve doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by the LMA.
The contract was voted against by 58% of all the members who took part in the vote.
On Thursday evening, the message Twitter, Elena Maccorta, a member of the JAC board, points out that the government continues to silence on this issue and therefore the contract proposal has been rejected.
She said: "As a result of the JCC vote, the proposal for a contract has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to require new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JCC formally asked today to meet with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts that will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the new doctors participated in six strikes, including, for the first time in the history of the NHS, having stopped their work.
After the vote rejecting the contractual terms proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, the representative of the LMA's new doctors Dr. Johans Malawana resigned from office.
Before meeting with 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer is good and will be accepted.
After the vote, the health secretary Jeremy Hunt informed us that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Extinction Alliance?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to bold up and declare the end of the eight-month war of names and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin congratulated Turkey's leader in St. Petersburg's castle, it came to the impression that this partnership is more necessary for Ankara.
However, the two folded.
Vladimir Putin’s smile looked frustration and did not cause warm emotions, even in view of his usual abstention.
On the other hand, the editor Tajjip Erdogan named Putin as his "dear friend" at least five times, reports a review of the meeting.
I've lost the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to pre-crisis levels but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm is causing conflicting feelings.
However, the lightning cooling of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the rubbish of the Russian plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow reacted to the sharps at that time.
Putin accused Ankara that it had put the dune in the back of Moscow.
It was even more painful because it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, the turkeys felt guilty of everything.
The most serious were the accusations that Erdogan's family itself had profited from the illicit trade in oil with the Islamic State controlled Syrian part.
He denied it, of course.
However, the main message of the Sankt Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
After all, this meeting was only due to the fact that Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia could perceive this as a kind of victory.
Ankara’s benefits of peace reconciliation are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the failure of the coup last month, in which he was trying to break down.
A number of terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russia's sanctions have caused serious losses, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually ensures the inflow of several million Russian tourists every year in Turkish resorts.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies are also easy to breathe when regular flights are restored.
They look forward to a holiday fever in the Mediterranean season.
This week, the national TV provides for a fall in fruit and vegetables prices, as imports of fruit and vegetables from Turkey will be restored.
As mentioned in the local newspaper Vedemosti: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives from Moscow.
Ankara is angry to the West about, in their opinion, the weak response to the coup attempt.
There is also a dissatisfaction with the long-standing negotiations on accession to the EU and the intervention of Putin, who is willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has alienated from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly obtained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing his support to its elected government after a coup attempt.
Be aware that Moscow understands this well, because it is itself deeply rooted in fear of the changeover of the regime in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxury offshore castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as a analyst named, the 'rest alliance', the two countries that feel excluded from the West, pool forces.
However, despite public unity, there are still significant differences in views between the two countries.
The main inconsistencies concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacekeeper, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of the initial negotiations, without wishing to disclose information, the two presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
The Turkish President targetedly avoided the issues of the inconsistencies of both countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how both countries can find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of open hostile relations and potential disasters, when a member of NATO Turkey took Russia's battleplane, the situation has improved, as both leaders have at least resumed the negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SKB will continue to play a support role as announced by the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Scottish SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevan tells the BBC Canal in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the Bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has abandoned these ambitions because, eight years ago, the bank was almost bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, branding strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The Bank received millions of pounds from international sport sponsors from the Six Nations regbie and the Vimbldon Tennis Champion Endy Murea.
However, it is now decided to put other national brands in the forefront.
Scottish Royal Banac will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initiated.
In England and Wales, all references to the SKB, outside the head office and official stock exchange, will be replaced to the name of NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There will now also be less private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevans was interviewed during the trip with customers and employees through Invernesshire.
He told BBC Scottish Canal: "SKB will become a brand of our investors and work with which our employees work, because we are now becoming more brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we have no more global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue to sponsor the "Six Nations" and will involve various brands in sponsoring sport.
"The time has come to become a brand bank, because we have long asked ourselves how to become a better bank for our clients?" says the Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become an excellent bank for our customers and develop these brands.
However, thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of customers, not our own needs, we have obviously made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think it is right time.
Frankie Detori won 3000 wins by obtaining the first place in the New Marketing with the Predilation of horses
Detories mark the champagne by fighting their 3000th victory twice by finishing the first race in Newmarket.
Friday, Professor Frankie Detori won his 3,000th victory in the history of Britain, gaining the first place in Newmarketing.
He achieved it by contesting the second victory in these races , which took place in his home city, with the Predilection, which is treed by John Gosden.
The 45 - year - old Italian is the sixth jacket, which has reached the result of horse racers.
He has joined Ser Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Pigot, Pete Ederi and Willie Carson.
The triple champion of the jacket Detori, who won before with the horse Ghayyar, said: "It's something special."
I'm so touched because my family is here.
I am very glad that this happened in Newmarketing because I lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, it is not a Royal Askota, but a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel comfortable and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Prediilection are expected with aplases and guivals.
Two vocabularies have reached this record in the race with obstacles - the champion Richard Johnson and the 20th-time champion Ser Antonio Maccoy, who has set several records in his career, fighting more than 4300 victories.
Lester Pigot, nine times the winner, won 4493 wins during the career.
Frankie is one of today's best jackets, and there's no surprise that he has made success, which only rarely can be achieved.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactical sensation distinguishes him from other jackets.
He is a fantastic representative of racing, his enthusiasm and harassment for years attracts fans to this sport.
A few weeks ago, I told Franky that he had already won 6,000 wins if he hadn't participated only in the weekends and the big races.
However, when it comes to serious speech, it is a real joy that Frankie has been winning the United Kingdom race regularly for 30 years.
He is a joyful man who is great in the British race, and he is an excellent joke.
Frank Detoric noted this achievement with his brand, a flight drift.
From finishing at the wind speed to a flying landing, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been the full way of adventure.
He has won countless large races, including the famous 1996 "Lielais Septītnieks" in Askot, and also survived a plane accident and distraint on the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he was hard to return after six months of distraint, but he demonstrated his power, challenging those who questioned him when returning to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for another time - Detori has previously said that he would like to continue the race at least 50 years of age.
President Putin releases the Head of Administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly rebates the head of the administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been in the hands of Putin’s nearest people for many years.
At the moment, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed a special representative for nature and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin has "continued to exempt Ivanov from the duties of the Head of the Russian President's Administration", without mentioning the reason.
Anton Vaino, who was his deputy since 2012.
The 44 - year - old Vaino has been a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin website (Russian language), he later led the President's minutes and the government staff's administration.
After his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main work of the administration is to support your work as President of the State by drafting laws and monitoring the enforcement of your decisions.
Putin said to a Russian broadcasting company on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave office and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Is the smile convincing?
This step has confused Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an ancient and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked at the Soviet Security Service.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia in this position.
At the national TV session, both men announced that Ivanov resigned from office on his own initiative.
But despite the camera smiles, which are rarely convinced by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the fight for power?
Nobody knows that.
However, the official statement that a man who was considered to be a prospective president suddenly wanted to become a leader of Russian environmental policy is perceived by great scepticism.
In the notes published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putina: "It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust this difficult post to me, even to say, a problematic post, for four years.
It turns out that I have been in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He was previously Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, just like Putin.
At the end of 1990, Putin led the Federal Security Service, who is the successor of the KGB, Ivanov took up his deputy position.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
At the end of the second term of Putina, Ivanov was considered to be a potential candidate for the position of President of Russia, as the election of Putina to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev, became President.
Putin became Prime Minister and returned to the President three and a half years later.
Little fish appearing in a garden in Banpha
A man from Banphas asks for help to find out the circumstances of the species in his garden in Banpha.
Kevin Bein thinks that 75 fish might be sandy geese who have lifted up with a bathroom.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 feet [500 m] from the sea, published a fish video on Periscope’s website, hoped that someone could know how these five - centimeter - large fish came into his garden.
Queenpheric crossing: the bridge is now connected to Faif.
Currently, the project worth GBP 1.35 billion is planned to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have joined the northern part of the Kvinsphere crossing and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is approaching the end.
The structure of the Faif Bridge is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10 000 tonnes of steel, 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 support cables.
Currently, a project worth GBP 1.35 billion is planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic secretary Keit Braun had come to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb on the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historical moment in the construction of the quannsphere bridge."
In this project we see an incompatible engineering solution where only the construction of these parts uses more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, the connection of the bridge to the viaduct is an extremely delicate process requiring huge accuracy.
Overall, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last stage that will connect the bridge to Rosit will be covered today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for installation.
Michael Martin, the director of the fourth bridge connection project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates high-class engineering.
After the last stage of the road and its connection with the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road to the part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by drifting the part of the North Pierre viaduct of 700 millimetres southward.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
It is huge because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled in slope by about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was just a few millimetres.
Fortunately, it's all done well.
Simon Bails gets gold in exercise for women.
Forget tension.
Forget anxiety.
Simon Bayl isn't all of this.
Dynamic lens.
Without effort, exercises on the waistline.
Unbleachable on the floor.
Absolutely perfect.
And finally the Olympic Championship.
On Thursday, the 19 - year - old American exerciser won a gold medal, fully showing the difference between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
She had a total number of 62,198 head courts over the score of the silver medal and her team member Alia Raismane and the score of the bronze medal of the Russian athlete Alia Mustafin.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simon Bails carried out a exercise on the bay sports exercise at the individual multi-fighting final for women in the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bayla became the fourth American afternoon who gained the title of a multitude champion and the fifth best vingroer, gradually strengthening the reputation as the best of its generation in the history of the vingroer and perhaps the best vingroers.
When the final result was announced, she poured into tears because the long way to this point was over.
This achievement ranks him next to unbelievable athletes like Michael Felp, who raised their sports at another level.
The Bayle has dominated its sport in the last three years by obtaining 15 medals in world championships, including 10 gold medals, carrying out such excellent, accurate and ambitious combinations of exercises that in 1984, the Olympic Champion Mary Lu Retone called him "the best vindor she ever saw".
In Brazil, she had the last test, where she had to deal largely with the hopes she had on, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas without golden medals.
The U.S. athletes Simon Bails (left) and Alia Raismane are visited after the winning of the gold and silver medal, respectively, at the individual multitude final of sports in the 2016 summer Olympics Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place on Thursday.
The first gold medal was obtained by Bayla on Tuesday, making a special ballet by Martha Karolji, a random coordinator.
Whilst Bayl claims that there was no such expectation on his long way to the peaks of praise, it is not true.
Part of her predecessor's free movements, which include her special acrobatic transition, are accompanied by Latin music that perfectly fits on the street next to the Rio Olympic Games Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents when she was still a baby, discovered by the coach Emiya Burmana's mother in a tour to the sports hall where Burmane's covenants took place, has now become a force to be counted.
She has not lost the multitude competition since the summer of 2013 and the victory series can continue as long as Bayle wants.
Although Mustafin’s two rotations led slightly, it was just a illusion.
Balanced base and free movements - the part of the competition where Bayl will defend his title of champion is still in front.
She set the front with a score of 15,433 on the ball and strengthened the leadership with a score of 15.933 in free movements
Raismane gently accused her as long as she waited for the results that were only a formality and she poured into the tears of joy when she fulfilled the dream she had ever recorded in her notebook.
The result of the Raismne was a slight rebellion for four years of events, when she divided the third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for the Bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which Americans call the "old mommy", set up in a convincing direction.
After the free movement of the performance, which dispelled her doubts about her return, she was able to devote the air kiss to the crowd.
Meanwhile, the 19-year-old viral Twitter record, which she published this week, now has a completely different meaning.
The 6-year-old Mahay Braun's "loop sailing" lives in question in Philadelphia.
The police say that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, stating that it is already the second six-year-old who shot in Philadelphia this week.
The grandparents of the child CBS to the Philadelphia news channel confirmed that it was Mahai Braun.
The grandparents say that Braun was shot several times, including in the circus, leg, arm, and abdomen, but there was still consciousness when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, says to the television: "He little body was simply a loud hole."
I can't believe it.
The boy has been placed in a hospital in critical condition and has already suffered several operations.
The family tells us that he will certainly recover.
He had to start in the first class of the local primary school.
Braun is one of the four people shot in the part of the city of Jermantaun.
Three men were also shot: two men 29 years old and one man 32 years old.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29 - year - old men is critical, while the other two victims are stable.
The channel says that the child was found in the front seat of the machine next to the 29 - year - old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims did not find themselves in the car and the police investigate whether one of them was a attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were most likely to be involved in the question.
At the site of the event there were found gun shells of patrons belonging to different weapons.
It seems that it has been a long-term fire.
Both sides of the pedestrian frame found shells.
"However, it looks like there have been several armed shooters here who actively participated in the question," says Antonio Ginaldi, Chief of the Philadelphia Police.
Damage has also been caused to several homes and cars.
No one has yet been detained and it is reported that the police check the records of surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday, during the fire, a wrong bullet hit a six - year - old girl in the hand while she played in front of her home in the region of Vestoukleina.
She gradually recovers, but the police still seek the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabia and Lauria?
I refer to this as the annual Women's Olympic Easy Late Teams for several reasons.
Firstly, I have been on all summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three lightweights in this team, Simon Bayl, Gabia Duglas and Lauria Hernandez, inspired by many young girls of origin.
People can be proud that this team consists of Alia Raismane, a Jewish woman and Medisona Kociana, who is a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best exerciser is an African American.
Last year, Simon and Gabia took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In previous Olympics Gabia Duglasa became an amazing champion of the Olympics, and America could be joyful.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises by Simon Bails, Duglas and Lauria Hernandez, the triple champion of the world, carrying out unprecedented, but mastery exercises.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth American in a row that has acquired a gold medal in individual multi-fighting women.
Her team's companion Alia Raismane got a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the situation in the rest of the country during exercise hours is completely different.
Simon, Gabia and Lauria entered the Olympics as Alia and Medisona.
They are the "Olympic Fifth" because the next Olympic Exercise team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year in the work of the trainer Marta Karola.
In fact, exercise is a costly sport. The trainees are mainly trained in private utility clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for exercises, premises, travels, forms, hotels (trainers, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these light sports clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes drive all of their workouts, and it is a costly and long investment for light-leaded families.
Amy Burman - Simon Bayl Coach and Maggie Haiti - Lauria Hernandez Coach has trained her athletes since both girls have started to work with a lightness.
We need to provide young girls who inspire Simona, Gabia and Lauria with cheaper exercise opportunities.
I set up my fraternity organization 20 years ago.
My organisation is located in Harlema and we offer more than 15 000 young people (mainly black and Spanish) exercise exercises at a cost or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit, my home town, to provide local young people with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Easy athletics develop strength, locality and body coordination, as well as teaching hard work, discipline and aspiration.
This combination provides a long life with good health and success both in school and at work.
This team will inspire thousands of young girls to work in lightness and it is fantastic.
Work on this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thank you Simona, Alia, Gabia and Medisona for the excellent demonstration of "Young Force", getting the golden medals of the Olympic Games and motivating countless young girls of different origins to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremiah Hant's offer, young doctors plan to expand more strikes.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on a change in the agreement with the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37 000 new doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July Hants announced plans to conclude a contract, stating that the NHS is in a fragile position and that further delays will only harm employees and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed a new contract which provides for changes to the conditions for night work and weekends in order to improve working conditions in non-standard hours.
On yesterday's evening, BMA's new doctors, Dr. Elena Makourta, announced that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will deepen the labour crisis and does not provide for equal treatment for all doctors.
The remaining eight weeks until the first group of new doctors will sign the new treaty, so progress must be made because there is no time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have been confronted with the government's unwillingness to engage and sometimes with full silence.
It happened despite the fact that last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremiah Hant should act immediately, stop being inactive and work with new doctors.
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protest shares.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 visits were carried out while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone in the pitch.
Ministers hoped to put an end to the dispute by reaching an agreement on the changes to the agreement with the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to increase the rate of work on weekends for 54 000 new doctors to be covered by new contracts.
Daniel Mortimers, Executive Director of the Employment of the NHS, invited young doctors not to go into strikes.
Mr Mortimera explains that the strikes are not solved, but only exacerbate pressure on the burdened workers and worry, create stress and obstacles for patients, carers and their families.
In the last two months, we have talked to the new committee of doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about guards and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as the placement of workers, flexible training, additional training for those returning after career breaks, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, abandonment of studies and gender pay inequalities in medicine shows that employers, English health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are keenly willing to implement the agreements concluded with the BME in November, February and May.
The medicine may reduce the risk of heartbeat by 2 pounds per day.
Thousands of patients who have had heart attacks could be treated with medicines at 2 pounds a day, as official representatives recommend that they be given more to people and for longer periods.
Antireductive medicines Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heartbeat in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for 12 months after heart beat, reducing the risk of re- heart beat.
NICE, represented by NHS, recommends the use of this product 4 years after heart beat to further reduce the risk of heart beat in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, NICE under the responsibility of the NHS is recommended to use this medicine for 4 years after heartbeat to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England experience heart attacks and a quarter of them experience recurrent heart attacks or strokes.
The heartbeat and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart walls, resulting in obstructions.
If the blockage plugs, it can cause a blood clot, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing heart attacks.
On the other hand, if the blood clot is separated from the wall of the blood vessels, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain leading to an infarction.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of re-heart.
Ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, a British company that is traded under the name Brilique, reduces the risk of developing thrombocytes.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and for another 3 years 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Health Technology Director Kerola Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent repeated heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had heart attacks experience another heart attack or stroke that often has serious consequences."
Fear of rehearted heart attacks can have a negative impact on the quality of life.
Evidence suggests that the combination of Ticagrelor with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks and infarction in people who have experienced it once.
By giving preliminary advice to treatment with Ticagrelor, we are glad that we can extend the treatment options to thousands of people who are thus benefiting.
In view of limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when taking this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used longer than this time limit.
Political correction culture promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former Mayor of Tauerhamlett, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that the culture of political corrections has opened eyes to wide-ranging fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Minister of Government Ser Erik Pikl criticizes the police, electoral supervisors and city councils that they ignore the signs of fraud in the election process, because "refusals of ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of communities, who has now become the leader of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so widespread that the police should allow the deployment of guards at the election stations to protect the intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present an identity document when they vote in order to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters must only indicate their name and address.
He even recommends marking the voter's fingers with a special ink to prevent double voting.
The rapporteurs should also be given greater protection, as Mr Erik says.
He believes that the press should be given greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The peaker is not only to prevent fraud in the elections, but also to protect local authorities from wider corruption and fraud culture that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was commissioned by Dauning Street after the scandal in connection with the Touerhamlet City Elections.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to cancel Mayor Lutfur Rahman from the post of Mayor for corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious view of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the view that the religious duty of believers Muslims is to vote for him."
About 300 votes were counterfeit or questionable because one person had voted several times.
Ser Erik also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it was particularly worrying that the fraud of voting by post, where older members of Muslim communities forced others to vote for the candidates they wanted.
Ser Erik recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral systems, including the presentation of an identity document.
His report says: "The evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the senior candidates selected by the communities, in particular in the Bangladesh and Pakistani communities."
"It is a concern that the regional authorities do not focus on these problems due to political corrections, as they could undermine ethnic and religious interests."
Sere Erik presented 50 recommendations on improving the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists to act with the votes put by mail to prevent the 'collection of votes'.
The report, which is being examined by Teresa Mey, also calls for a more thorough check of registration in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for fraud in the field of immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of requesting voters to present an identity document before the vote.
Select the fingers of the voter with a special ink to prevent double voting.
systematically verify the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Determine three-year restrictions for requests for automatic mail voting.
Prohibit the work of political campaign participants and activists with the votes cast by post and election envelopes for the vote by post.
Ensure the police with the powers to appoint guards at the electoral stations.
Change the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Prohibit the photography of the election stations.
Requirement to use only English (except in Wales) in the electoral compartments.
Strengthen training to ensure that the teams go to the election of uraniums by one.
Sir Erik is a sharp critic of the Metropole police, saying that there is no accusation in the Tauerhamlet case.
He says: "The court only disqualified Luftur Rahman and his representative for acts related to corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly found to be guilty of the standard of evidence of criminal law on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective "checkchecking" of the city council voters in the registration of voters.
Ser Erik says: "The judgment of the court last year is a alarm call.
Our land is known as the homeland of Parliament, but the dissipation of worrying and hidden electoral fraud and the fact that fraud does not endanger this good reputation.

The CBC Olympic Games commenter apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer is 'to end as a pig'.
An analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanha Finish in the fourth place of the 4x200 m free-style stafe for women, called a shouting storm in CBC viewers.
Canadian CBC was forced to apologize, because one of its commentaries commented that the 14-year-old Chinese sailor had been "departed from the competitions that slipped alone" and "defined as a pig".

"Too fleeing, she went out of the race that hid alone and ended like a pig."

You represent CBC and Canada, and because of you, we all sound like racists.
Soon afterwards, Scott Russell, who then led the CBC direct, apologized for the comments made by McDonald, saying, "We apologize that the comment on the swimming result was made in the direct ether."

Primark's buyers are shocked by a woman who is ingracefully acquainted with the middle of the underwear store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when a woman began to dress up to hold the cocktails in the middle of the store.
As she worsened the situation, she surrounded her to make sure that she was present and then pulled off by putting the tickets back into the store shelf.
She continued to search for clothes in Folkestonas Bouverie Place in the shopping center store and held four more tickets.
Primark store Bouvrie Place in the shopping centre in Folkeston – the place where this woman kept the underwear and then put it back in the shelf.
At that time, there was also a two - babies’ mother, Jenny Davidson, who says that the unknown woman wrapped her clothes and abandoned her shop without buying anything.
She points out that people were unable to believe in their eyes.
Staying in the middle of the store, she took her underwear, pulled her trousers and trousers, and measured them there.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place to measure them, she simply held them there.
Everyone looked like she pulled the bikes and apparently didn't like them because she just put them back in the shelf.
She measured three more tickets until she decided that she did not like any of them and left her shop.
He did not seem to be worried that someone would look or think about the person who would buy the clothes she wears.
Miss Davidson (33 years old) says from Kenth: "The idea that someone will buy clothes that another man has surrounded and which have not been washed."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson adds: "I assume that the shop workers took the clothes from the store shelves after leaving her, which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine you could buy a new underwear and learn that another woman has supported them and then has not washed them.
The representative of Primark indicated that Primark was known for an incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Specific clothes have been removed from the store’s shelves.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect ourselves in the nearby distance from the attackers with a fireplace, we talked to Krav Maga's major messenger from New York Ron Mizraki.
Regardless of whether you are attacked from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get the top of the attacker.
The barracks shall be indicated if the attacker attacks from the back, then first it is necessary to turn to see the attacker clearly and to avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the weapon should be conceived between its front hand and the shoulder, and the face of the opponent must be squeezed with its free breath.
Then follow the crash with the knee through the circumference and until the attacker is stiff in pain, remove the weapon from him, jump through the face with the crash of the gun and go away by continuing to draw the weapon against him.
If the attacker is approaching the front, the situation is similar: avoid the trajectory of the shot, grasp the weapon and locate it so that the evil can't shoot.
At the same time, pressure on the gun must be made and the opponent must be hit by the chest and finally remove the gun from the gun and go further on the gun.
Sounds difficult?
Look at the video to see how the Mizraki does it.
But remember if you're not a Craw Mag master, then it's more safe to give your money to the robber.
The Vandal family dismisses the social house of Saltaša Kornvola and is placed on the street.
The Vandal family has been put out of the place of residence for the terrorisation of neighbours, causing damage to the social house of 50 000 pounds.
Tanja Skeldona and her partner Šons Trebilkoks were only made out of their property in Saltash Cornvol, because a number of complaints were lodged for them.
When they were forced out of property, the shocked residential representatives found that the property was completely demolised.
In the floors and walls there were scattered holes, the waste was discarded everywhere, and the walls were covered with a graphite.
The family is now put out of property and is likely to live in private property.
Donna Makevoja, manager of the Housing Service in Cornwall, says that there are concerns that housing cannot be restored.
She says that people living here were extremely difficult and she believes that people could not live it.
In this case, a number of factors should be assessed, since the property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation in the future.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who had periodically lived in possession, and the police say that their terror manifested as violence, breaking down on the streets with baseball sticks, intimidating the local population, drug use, drug trafficking, and loud shame and laughing.
The 47-year-old Skeldone, whose name was property, was sentenced in June for antisocial behaviour.
In several demolised house rooms, waste was found to be wasted.
A number of floor boards have also been selected in a home where drug trafficking is possible.
The neighbors say they were regularly wandering on the street and being constantly called police.
Cornwall’s Housing Service forced them out of property when they were given 11 weeks to get out of the house voluntarily.
The desperate neighbors were very happy for their desolation because their life was an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care for other people."
We lived next to them for 20 years, it has always been crazy.
It is unbelievable how often we have seen the police here.
We couldn't lie down this morning.
We wake up, because there was so quiet here - we haven't used it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the Head of the Neighbourhood Protection of the Housing Service in Cornwall, said that the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and was regularly referred to as the police.
A variety of old and unusable items were found in the house’s raised garden.
He also said: "It's very sorry that the tenants did not show any responsibility for their behaviour, because displacement from the house is always the last step considered by the Housing Service in Cornwall."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and their neighbors were very hard to look at their behavior.
I appreciate the work of all my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the Communist who were courageous and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for neighbours and will show that antisocial behaviour is not acceptable.
Fitspatrick said that all three sons had lived here in different periods of time, but all were about 20 years old.
An dirty mattress that left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying.
The staff of the service will now have to clean the waste stack left in the house.
In 2014, the police house was shaking and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone is only recognised to be guilty of the storage of class B narcotic drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a monument to her son, Li Sheldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After putting out, it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plimuta.
Many walls of the house were marked with graphics.
The police tells them that they will continue to expel tenants who violate their rental contracts.
Ninth and Cornwall Police Representative Angela Krova point out that this release is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who believe that they can behave as they want and will not have any consequences."
The Devona and Kronvola police are not admissible criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue working with our partners to protect local communities.
Preparedness to spend can give an impetus to the economy.

The cannabis mayor banned burkini swimming clothes in the beach.
The Mayor of the French Southern Creort City of Cannes has banned the wearing of sailing clothes in the beaches of this city, which almost completely cover the woman’s body and very resemble the hydrowear, the local officials announced on Thursday.
The Mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order that " access to beaches and swimming is prohibited for anyone who has no bathing clothes respecting good customs and secularism" as a basic principle of the French Republic.
"The apparel of the palace, which expressly demonstrates religious belongings when France and the places of culture are the purpose of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk of public policy disruption (conflict, collisions, etc.), which is necessary to prevent," states the Order.
"We are not talking about the ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about external clothing that involves confidence in the terrorist movements that are fighting with us", explained Tierry Miguls, the municipal manager of utilities.
He added that the burkini swimwear has not been seen in the Cannes beaches since 28 July, when the right-hand member of the Central Party "Republicans" signed this order and it entered into force.
This week, the Aquapark in the city of Marseille cancelled a planned private event for Muslim women who would have dressed in burkins in bathing clothes, because the embarrassment of such an event was expressed by both the politicians of the right and left circles.
In France, it is prohibited to wear muslim women's headgear covering the face, but it is not prohibited to wear religious symbols or appropriate clothing.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terror organised in the nearest resort city of Nice, for which the Islamic State group took responsibility.
On July 26, two attackers who had sworn confidence in the Islamic State brutally murdered the priests at the church in the north-west of France.

The festival "Cuban" started in Lucavsala.
Thursday, August 11, in the evening of Lucavsala, the start was given to one of the last festivals of this summer - there will be "Cuban" until Sunday night.
On the first evening, the groups such as "Enter Shikari" from the United Kingdom, which were expected last year, but without seeing disappeared from the program, American pancakes "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
In the next days of the festival there are also remarkable words: Guano Apes and Garbage, the legendary "Ramones", Markijs Ramons with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with the leader of the Belarusian pancroque in Sergeja Mihalokas, the popular actor and singer Vahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Vopli Vidoplyasova" and a number of other, but the full programme can be viewed here.
This is the second year when the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year, it suffered financial failure and huge losses, but it did not stop the organizers from a repeated attempt – they added a spirit sign to the name, the programme included a Latvian group (Friday evening 19:15 on the stage dune "All Day Long") and declared that the festival has now become "a closer and gained a local colorite alongside such symbols as its panoramic and cats".
Whether these efforts are justified, it is too early to judge, because the festival just fled, but, as Delphi Entertainment was observed in the first evening, at least the huge efforts of people have not been made and the number of visitors was similar to that of the last year.

President, who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
Friday, August 12, about 145 years since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but unreasonably left the shadow of the first Latvian President Jānis Čakste and the pre-war president Karlis Ulmanis.
None of our nationals have defended democracy and the rule of law as Zemgals, and Arnold Auziņš writes in the book dedicated to Gustav Zemgal 10 years ago.
Talking with the Delfi portal, Auziņš emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the rare politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humour.
The rest of this kind, always very right.
He taught not to be, but today it could be like Raimonds Vējonis.
"He was the one close to the people," says Auziņš.
Today's politicians know bad history, they responded to Karli Ulmani as a good leader, but rarely who knows how bad he was.
The only person he wasn't scattered at the government's meetings was General Balodis.
Even if he was kind and smiling in pictures, he was histetic by nature.
"Semgal with its sense of humor and democracy leaves the opposite impression," says Auziņš.
Aivars Stranga, professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in conversation with Delfi, agrees with the Aukstās appraisal of Zemgala as a peaceful and weighed national husband.
He also notes that Zemgals has expressed respect for minorities and regularly invited Jewish representatives to the Presidential Palace.
"At that time, it was not a habitual act, after the Zemgal Presidency Alberts invited to take over this tradition," the historian says.
He was such a quiet and weighed man who had long to talk to be President.
He didn't look after it, but he just didn't hate praise.
He also appreciated himself quite critically because he did not know French, but he felt that the President had to understand it.
"The foundations of French were learned during the period of the republication," explains Stranga.
The underground did not allow it to be repeated, but he did not like so high posts.
In any event, he is a very worthy personality in the history of Latvia, before entering the Presidential Castle was a serious position - he was very demanded by the notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgala treasury in Suvorova Street 3, where the society of collectors and publishers was located, in practical government negotiations in Latvia.
He was always progressively mooded.
There was not a great fan of Ulman, but there was no public objection to him.
"In private conversations, though, it has sometimes been said that the activities of Ulmanis do not simplicate him," says Stranga.
He lived peacefully, and there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How does Zemgal remember today?
I'm sorry, but for a large part, he's just associated with a street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, the opinions were central.
"He did not have any major shocks during her time, that is, he could be associated with such a real stable Presidency," says Stranga.
During the Presidencies of Gustava Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, also took place a visit to Sweden by Latvia, which, at the time, implicitly meant full recognition of Latvia in the neighbourhood and inclusion in the family of democratic nations in Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals arrived at the country visit to Stockholm.
The Swedish King Gustav V response visit to Latvia took place on June 29, 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but left forever in January 1939.
Just ways to help your child cope with anger attacks.
I often face the fact that parents view child’s anger, angryness as something wrong and unusual.
When a child openly shows his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
Specialist urges a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and annoyance, which are experienced periodically by everyone.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed against another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, worrying - we usually know what happens to us and how to deal with it.
We can express, oppress, hide, keep, tell our friends or other lovers about it, we can piss sofa, smoke cigarette (this is not the best way to shed anger!), get in the shower, put in the table and do other things that we usually do not.
We do not turn our aggression to others, because we know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children who experience anger do not understand what happens to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", you're a fool, "Devil mom", "I don't see you", "I'm not gonna friendly with you" - and very rare when you can say, "I'm angry to you."
Children live literally, they are completely located right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly in their feelings, and often also in the imprisonment of different emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prohibit the child from showing feelings, including anger, grieving about it, but, on the contrary, helping the child.
Do you need a pause in your relationship?
A long working day, in which everything hasn't happened as you would like, or just a bad mood - there are so many reasons why you would like to have a moment, a day or even longer "off" from all over the world.
Can a relationship be paused and a little breathed for a moment?
Does this, however, show that each partner has its own path?
Ladies share their views in different ages.
John (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if the relationship requires a pause, you are not with the real person."
Meanwhile, Eduards (30) has discovered a scheme that may help someone.
If you feel that your partner starts to fall into your nerves for every smallest detail, then certainly - it's the right time to explore other hunting fields to understand if you miss her or especially don't think about her or even don't want to see her anymore.
So the answer is yes, withholding a pause can help save time and understand how important you have a second half.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
I think it is necessary to keep a pause of one of the other every day, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then the disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every detail that the other does, and it begins to fall into the nerves.
People start to piss each other, especially if there is no longer anything to talk about, just about what you have done in the day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not endured the relationship for more than a few months.
If you think at some point that it is better elsewhere or with another woman, then why is this woman with whom you are together deserves someone who can think that there is not enough good here and there are fields of paradise behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is already a small treasure.
If not, then not.
"I have, so a little condemned those who do not." Edmunds said (46).
Carlim (33) has a completely opposite view.
I think everyone needs a time to breathe.
You can't watch each moment, all the time, from morning to evening, each other's eyes and be joyful for the everlasting love.
Come on!
There are so many things - friends, work, party.
All of us have their own time.
Of course, even a friend or wife, though, if both are able to maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, it can survive to the edge of the grave.
That's it.
Martiņš (27) says: "It is difficult to say - it is necessary or not, may or may not take it pause, but one is clear - there is nothing to the end of its proposed relationship, something is missing."
If this issue comes out, it must be counted that there will be any change in the near future - to the right or to the bad side - that depends on itself.
I think as long as you are young and crazy, while you need a pause - even all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes in a completely different phase, there can be no talk about rest.
You decide to spend all your life together!
"If you can already endure each other's society and once again you need to breathe, what will be when you are pensioners who comment, like missing cats snow or disputes about the day on which the garden is better to worn," explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the kings have been changed.
With its exciting and exciting personality, Rozentals first worried the Latvian people's interest in imaginating art.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which will remain unforgettable forever," Romans Suta wrote about the old master of Latvian painting Jani Rozental.
It is also clear in 2016, when the old master’s extensive retrospective exhibition in the renovated main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art is opened - Rozentāls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be viewed until 30 October.
The Latvian National Museum of Art, with a wide retrospection in the newly created Grand Exhibition Hall, honors the painter Jani Rozental (1866-1916), whose hundred-fifth birthday is internationally included in the UNESCO holiday calendar.
A retrospective exhibition of more than 150 works is one of the central events of the Janis Rozentāls anniversary programme.
The selection of art works is largely made from the stock of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of classic creative activity, stylistic variability and variety of techniques.
Additionally, exhibits from the Akseli Gallen-Callea museum, the Museum of Writing and Music, the Liepaja Museum, the Museum of Tukums and several private collections in Latvia and Finland are used.
For centuries, the atmosphere of the mia revives the presence of photos, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals the connections of individual artworks with photographs taken by the painter for the purposes of creativity by his own camera.
On the other hand, the Finnish-Latvian Friendship Society "Rozentāls-seura", named on behalf of the Latvian classic, at the National Art Museum of Latvia, at the same time offers the first stop of a small informative traveling exhibition "with view in Finland, with heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with a content presentation in English, Finnish and Swedish will be opened in the Helsinki "Virka" gallery in autumn.
Matt Leblank is waiting for the return to the "TopGear" show with impatientness.
Mets Leblanks, the head of the TV broadcast "TopGear" ("Gaz in the floor"), said that he was waiting for the return of the car show in the second season with an unaccompanied expectation, but recognised he did not know who would expect him in the future.
At the moment nothing is formally happening.
"If there are, then the BBC will be announced," Leblanks discovered in conversation with television critics.
The doubts about the future of "Gaze in the floor!" occurred in July when Leblanka's survivor Kriss Evans declared that he left the program.
After leaving, Evans acknowledged that Leblank and "Gaz in the floor!" were "as created for each other".
Evanss described the stars of the former serial "Friend" ("Friends") as a "real and hard man", thus distracting the fears that both friendships have collapsed during the filming.
When Leblankm asked what he liked most in the show, he answered that traveling to other countries, such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
Telechannel BBC says that the show is not going to replace Evans in the new 24th season.

U.S. models of business behind his interpretation have gained the perverty of exquisite photosession glance and horror of the film.
In essence, very provocative, decent and banal vulgarist work, which makes it difficult to draw the borderlines between the European art house film and the Hollywood genre product territory.
The film with Vigo Mortensen underlines the question of whether the conceptually chosen lifestyles (environmentality, vegetarianism, alternativeism and separation from the smoothness and values of the consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The father of six children, after his wife’s death, is confronted with questions about the correctness and true values of the imaginations.

Of course, the shark is doing this alone as a attack on the foolish girls - it was a swimming agent in the jackets, in this case, a brave sulfurator, which is reproduced by Blake Laiville.

Collegovo shall refuse to stand as the Head of the VID.
Inga Koļegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, decided to withdraw his nomination for the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), informed the Agency LETA at the Ministry of Finance.
Colegovo points out that her discussion of the candidate has increased contradictions between the ruling coalition parties.
The real reasons for the debate seem to be related to the visible, but more often invisible interests of politicians, and they do not relate to the assessment of my professional capacity.
"I am also inadmissible," stresses the applicant for the post of Head of the VID.
If her nomination was approved by the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and would not allow the full work and the necessary changes to the SDG to be achieved by feeling the support of the entire government.
Without that, the full work would not be possible, Colegovo concludes.
"I have moreover publicly emphasised that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at present all my candidateships have been politicised too much," explains the official.
"I thank you for my trust and support, it's a experience that we value as a benefit", says Kolegova in the application to Reisser-Ozol.
Consent on Wednesday stated that during the meeting with Colegov, there was a "significant contradiction" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers about the costs of dividends of SIA Pallogs, as the decisions of the participants' meetings available to the public Pallogs provide for a non-distribution of profits.
Currently, the Head of the VID is a Deputy Director-General in Dace Pelek.
The police involved in the rescue of two young children left under supervision, informed by the State Police Regional Administration of Latgale.
Knowledge of unsupervised rats with infants was received on Friday around 7 a.m.
They were located in Līvāna at the former store building.
Both young girls were immediately handed over to provide help.
There was also a bag with documents and a mobile phone left in the chariots.
During a short period of half an hour, the law firmly explored the possible location of the parents and went there.
When a woman arrived at the civil husband’s home, the police found that the woman was sleeping because she was a strong drink.
According to the initial information on the evening of the last day, in 1992, a young woman visited a friend who used alcohol.
When she walked home after a joint sitting, she decided to leave her children to the shop in unexplained circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphan court of the event, which will also decide on the future fate of the children.
The Freeport of Riga has implemented all the recommendations of the EWC regarding the Russian island project.
The Freeport Administration of Riga has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Audit Office (VK) in general regarding the development of the project Infrastructure for relocation of port activities in the Russian island from the city centre, informed the portal Diena.lv in the company.
The approval of the project is planned at the nearest meeting of the Freeport Board of Riga.
In order to implement the recommendations in line with the discretion of the EQC, when preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Freeport Administration was also guided by the conclusions of legal and operational audits carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport Administration of Riga and the recommendations made to improve project management in the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the DC today.
Despite the fact that the Freeport Administration of Riga does not agree with the opinion drawn up by the NC on the usefulness of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the donor of funding - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to point out that all the works planned under the project have been completed in full within the set time limits and in the scope of the project.
"We have fully implemented all the recommendations of the EQC regarding project management and monitoring issues to all those involved in the project, including the EC, EQC and also the Stividors that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project", says Sanita Kaire, the Head of the project of the Russian island.
The long-term action plan for the control and monitoring of the project objective was complemented by the main planned activities of the parties involved and the time limits for the decisions needed, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process, as well as the definitions of the most important border points.
The approved action plan to achieve the project target by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the EWC, was complemented by enforcement monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the monitoring of the duration of the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project by Riga Freeport.
The project management plan has been re-developed to improve project management and reduce potential risks, defining the areas of project management and identifying the drafted documents providing a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
In order to increase the project capacity, a project management structure has been developed that reflects the planned structure of the project management team, the qualifications and functions of staff.
In order to improve communication between the Freeport Administration of Riga with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the interested parties has been developed, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the interested parties for successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of exchange of information.
On the other hand, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the opening of procurement and the rule of law will need to be more detailed in the future.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built a world-standard port infrastructure - four new deep-sea ports, rail ports, as well as engineering communications.
The structures co-financed by the Cohesion Fund have been completed and put into service at the end of the year that has already passed, with a savings of EUR 10.6 million in the funding envisaged.

The meeting will discuss the consequences of the British Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without Britain.
Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of deaths at the former Eastern Germany border of the Communist junction could be much higher than previously considered, but doubts about the number of real victims have not yet been resolved.
According to the data given to the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie on Wednesday, between 1945 and 1989 at the border with Western alliances and the later Communist authorities of the West Germany killed 1841 people who tried to leave their controlled area.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and adjusting the number of victims at regular intervals.
This year, 11 more deaths were added to the list, including the inclusion of a six-year-old boy who slipped by the family trying to get to West Germany through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the young victims of the Berlin Wall, there are also deerers of the Soviet army.
"The ultimate amount of damage caused by the dual evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented", acknowledges Alexander Hildebrante, Director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died while trying to escape from the Communist-controlled state are maintained and not disappeared", emphasised in the communication distributed by Hildebrante.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
"The figure of 1841 is unconvincing", Johens Stata, an expert in the history of the Eastern Germany of the Free University of Berlin, says the Süddeutsche Zeitung interview.
He, together with other researchers at the Free University of Berlin, currently reviews the possible suspicious deaths at the border and has so far managed to confirm only 260 cases.
Earlier, researchers thought that 138 people were murdered by the Communists only at the Berlin Wall.
In view of those who have died trying to escape the Baltic Sea or to come to the West through the territory of the neighbouring countries, the number of victims could, in the opinion of the State, reach around a thousand.
However, this is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different numbers of victims could be different methodologies.
The Checkpoint Charlie museum also lists all suicide cases of the Eastern German border guards, whether directly related to their service.
The museum also lists non-direct violence-related deaths.
"If older people from 70 to 80 years of age have died of heart attack, it must have the consequences of this "slepsy border", says Hildebrante.
However, Stath is convinced that there should be a distinction between the old people who may have died as a result of their dealings with them, and those whose deaths are caused by long waiting for the bus at the border.
In spite of this, the records of the victims are not easy, since the Communist authorities of East Germany did not collect such statistical data, and researchers have to educate documents in different scattered archives, states the Station.
However, the Stalt Group has recently come up with new documents and could therefore come up with a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
Mr. Rio, President of the LPF, went with a coach accreditation; it's a surprise for himself.
In recent days, the President of the Latvian Fleet Federation (LPF) Kaspars Mr. Rio de Janeiro has arrived in the Olympic Games with a coach accreditation, but he feels surprised about it.
On Wednesday, a wide-ranging joy was caused by the statements made by the Olympic Swimming Board of Alan Ribakov Germana Jakubovska, who found that at the last time he decided to go to Rio de Janeiro, Mr. while the coach had to stay home.
Initially, sailors Alan Ribakov and Uvis Kalniņš, coachs Jakubovskis and Dave Kolins, as well as the president of the Federation, were approved on the list of drivers.
The Latvian Flying Federation applied for the Olympic Games for five participants, and Aldon Vrubļevskis claimed that the Germans will and will be looking for tickets.
"However, obviously for objective reasons he was not," Mr said, saying that it had no effect on the results of Ribakov.
At the request of the Federation, Uvja coach took her to help.
Sir, who himself is a member of the LAG Executive Committee, he has sharply criticised the LOC's activities, bringing the guilty of the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organisation.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five persons in the LAG Executive Committee and not to bring any of them.
"I don't know why there was not enough space for the Fleet Federation," Mr President said, the work of the Federation and their presidents has not been appreciated in society, reminding them that the presidents of the Federation do not receive salaries.
He also criticised Mr Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he appealed to the International Federation of Water Sports (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any sportsman.
Mr. could not tell you why he is in the Olympic Games with a coach's accreditation, which is likely to have come to Jacukovskim.
"I was registered as the president of the Federation ("theam leader"), but for unknown reasons I received a coach accreditation and I am not in anywhere."
The situation changed every day and the number of accreditations available changed.
By the last time, I think the Germans will be, because I had no other information.
According to the information available to LETA, a couple of days before the start of Ribakov she had a conversation with the eye of Ponia and after it the swimming-up was with tears in the eyes, but the President of the LPF said that it was a daily conversation with the desire to mood athletes before the start.
Mr recalled that the LPF oversees five types of sport in the Olympic Programme, and four of them are training children in Latvia as well.
The president of the Federation said that it is also very important in Latvia for the issues of slipping, and he has spoken about such programmes, when Rio de Janeiro has been in the past for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the Federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup stage could be handled in Latvia.
The presence of Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I worked here, spent my time and I tried to implement the four-yearly programmes.
Many will inlet 600 000 salmon juveniles.
During the Latvenergo Fish Restocking Programme this week, salmon and tomato juveniles are taken in Daugava near Mangaļsala, and this year more than 600 000 annual salmon and tomato juveniles are planned to be introduced in the fish farms of Bior Tome and Dole.
Latvenergo Agency LETA informed that fish entry would continue in the coming months – 6 300 000 juveniles and larvae of different species are enrolled in the water of the Daugava basin every year.
In the spring and early summer of 2016, the larvae and the larvae will be released, in June - singing, in July - the only summer salmon, in August and September - the zandarts and the vitae.
Director of Latvenergo production Māris Kuņickis said that environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of Latvenergo group.
"Any activity is aimed at environmentally friendly activities, in close cooperation with the Scientific Institute Bior, through both juvenile growth and introduction in the Daugava basin and other activities," said Kuņickis.
This year, more than 600 000 single-year-old salmon and tomato babies will be entered in the Daugava Griva.
For the second year, the juveniles of fish are marked before entering, cutting the fat.
Today, there are 25 000 salmon juveniles with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Every year, juveniles and larvae are taken into the composition and numerical range of scientifically-based species in Daugava and its basin waters.
The multiplication of fish resources in Daugava and its water pools is carried out by Bior in accordance with the laws and regulations, based on an expert on the losses caused by Latvenergo’s economic activity to fish resources and providing an opinion on the compensatory measures to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
The State Environmental Service shall, on the basis of that examination, decide on the amount and nature of the compensation.
Latvenergo’s annual compensation for the recovery programme amounts to EUR 1 035 000.
In spring 2016, Latvenergo, in cooperation with the "We Fish" association, deploys 400 artificial fish nasal nest in Daugava near Kaibala and Ikšķile for the fifth year.
Cooperation with the association to promote the natural hake of fish is an additional initiative supported by Latvenergo in the framework of the Renewal of Fish Resources Programme.
Placement of artistic neurological nests in the water store is an important measure to promote the conservation and reproduction of fish resources in Daugava.

Reids claims that if Klinton will be elected presidential post, she will appoint Garland as judge of the Supreme Court.
Harry Reid, the leader of the Senate Democratic Party, is convinced that if she becomes President, she will nominate Mary Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked the approval of Garland since March when President Obama nominated him.
The leader of the Senate's majority Mitch Makonnel said that the next President will choose who will replace the current judge of the Supreme Court Antonin Skalu.
On Thursday, during its conference, Reid declared that it was certain that Clinton would choose Garland.
Reida’s representative later said that he had not personally spoken about this topic with Clinton and it was only speculation.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "catch the boat" with another choice.
Garlands is the main judge of the U.S. Colombia District Court of Appeal.
Reids said that the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are in the interests of Donalda Trampa, the President of the Republican Party.
He also said that Tramps was not suitable for the President's work.

Women will want to participate in this project, because it is an excellent artwork.
Models can be sent to electronically or personally boxing sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrae - a video overview
Scientists claim that Greenland’s sharks have the longest lifetime from all vertebral animals to our planet.
A shark researcher Julius Nealsen says that a long - life record belongs to a woman who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters old.
The French court rejects the request to break down the stores in the Yangley Refugee Camp.
The French court dismissed the Kale authorities' request to break down tens of self-established shops and restaurants in the “Junglių” camp where several thousand refugees live.
At this week's hearing in Kale, the authorities indicated that the country should mix 72 self-established shops where people in the camp area sell various goods, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some self-built restaurants in the euro.
The Caye Prefect Office pointed out that these self-established companies should be rebuilt because they form the shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the Humanitarian Group explained to the court that these small enterprises are important, as food provided by governments and support groups does not provide the needs of the camp in which the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that the self-established shops and restaurants often offer free shelter and food to those who need it most.
The Lille Court ruled that there was no legal basis for expulsion of people who created 72 self-established shops, but it understands Kale's prefect concerns.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply provide food to people who live in "extraordinarily short conditions".
He pointed out that these places were peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the camp café "Jungle Book Kids", which provides more than 200 free meals per day, English and French languages and provides advice on asylum issues for hundreds of vulnerable minors without being accompanied by adults.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of a child's café.
The letter addressed to Guardian states that the liquidation of the café " would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charitable organizations "Help to Refugees" and "L'Auberge des Migrants" said that the population of the "Jungļu" camp has increased to 9000 people, which is the highest since the rapid influx of migrants in summer.

The impressive performance of the British sample regbija-7 series ended on Thursday, when in the exciting final fight "Deodoro" stadium Rio Fiji the national unit convincingly destroyed them with the result 43:7.
Fiji showed a master class of ball management, the balls played with a leg, a support game and a brutal force game, fighting gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The Sake brought a decent reward of comfort - a silver medal that was then the third medal of the United Kingdom. The British selection can be proud of its success in the first Olympic Rhegbi-7 tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The heavy battle in the semi-final, in which the team of Boks suffered the defeat with the result 7:5 in the first half of the day, probably played in the final.
But in any case, Fiji's selection is now in its best form to win also 15 men's team.
Although unlikely, a certain comfort for the United Kingdom could be the fact that at least one British acquired a gold medal. It is the Fiji's main coach Ben Ryan - the former English coach from Vimbldon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Raiena, they lost all the games regbia-7 in the stage of the Adelaid.
This time they lost only one game.
The shot is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji impressively started the magic, reproving British power techniques for joy after.
Captain Tom Michel and the companions it was like a twist with several anti-buses, and the champions of the World Series arose under the direction of 5:0 when Osea Colinisau won the first land.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the weight of the land in the right wing.
Outcome 12:0 and the British team had not even touched the ball.
Michel’s excellent method of power prevented leaning Leone Nakarava from reaching three points, but it only had a little effect on Fiji’s outcome.
The seventh minute of the games Jasa Veremalua took the ground in the right corner, strengthening the weight over Britain to 17:0.
After the game Nakarava increased its weight and had left more than a minute to the end... the end of the first half of the period.
Vatemo Ravouvou was avoided by some invaluable methods of British power and crossed the line by reaching points.
Land provided the result at 29:0.
It seemed that Fiji was born to play Regbia-7 matches while the British still learn.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a thorough change in the half-time, overseeing Fiji's player line... full of four minutes, which after the first half-time standards was good, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team game, won a few more points for Fiji's team.
Den Norton succeeded in gaining points for the British team, making the ground in the left corner and reaching the result of 36:7, but the game was already lost, while the fans of the South Sea islands sang, bowed flags and dance in tribes.
You can’t be surprised by Fiji’s joyful attitude.
Matt William made Fiji win even more sweet with another earthly game at the end of the game.
When playing the end of the game, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British could only sit in the grass.
In the first half of the day in the semi-final Fiji defeated Japan with the result 20:5, while the British were superior to South Africa, where in a very strong battle both teams won by land and the South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the time Kail Braun put the Box team under command, but in the second half of the time, Den Norton crossed the line with shiny mastery and brought the ball between the pillars, providing the British victory.
Markus Vatson, a brother of the English regbia-15 team, Antonio, gave the team victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach’s fight against cancer inspired Helen Glover and Heter Staning for the victory of the roasting competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races, and it already expresses a lot.
From the first to the last cancer, Helena Glovere and Hetere Staninga’s golden moment had a special role in the Estacio da Lagoa route.
Although there are only two athletes on the boat, they were accompanied by Robin William’s support, which inspired them to get up to the second Olympic Gold medal in the winding of pairs to women, becoming the first women in the history of British sports that has succeeded.
They were undoubtedly dominated because they won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory for the 39th time.
Both great athletes with gulbja elganci slip through the surface of the water, do not fully reflect this triumph.
A trainer who did not know 30 months ago, or would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer, is working hard for athletes to continuously improve their performance and contribute most to their successes.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the ones that can operate and that happened.
If not, it would spread throughout the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It's a little change in your vision.
William’s cancer was detected in December 2013.
This trio was lucky that William was able to initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 inter-session and to reduce the duration of the interruption to a minimum if it could be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in a hospital and I went 6, 10 and even 15 meters long distances, although the doctor said that it would be enough to take a few steps.
It all started.
Irritation itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about William, who was very worried all the morning and spoke more than usual in the impression of anxiety.
Staning, which has served in the Royal Artilerian unit in Afghanistan, said: "This was a emotionally severe week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The 3 years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we wouldn't have achieved anything, so great thanks to him he is the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better workmate or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Heter Staning have not lost in any race within five years.
A couple reaches the huge speed with which competitors cannot compete.
Even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Staning and Glover were overweight.
We felt every moment.
Helen said, "Save the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
Do not lose concentration is really important.
We had a good start, but at the same time we had no hope.
That day, we didn't want to break the record, but we just had a good hatch and win the race, and we did that.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month there will be a wedding of Glover and TV adventure seeker Stīva Bašal.
In the meantime, she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't want to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic Champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Colegovi VID leaders will "direct to the last".
According to him, the Prime Minister Mārim Kučinskim (Green and Farmers' Union) and the Minister of Finance Danai Reizniece-Ozol (Green and Farmers' Union) are now "very important" for the approval of candidates appointed by the Minister of Finance in the position of the Head of the SDG.
Rajevskis decided that both Kučinskim and Reisniece-Ozola, in this government, the approval of the Head of the VID is the "first big decision", which can affect their future as politicians.
If they now start to change their position in the selection of the candidate for a VID manager, this will have a negative impact on their imidents in the public administration.
The agenda of the next week's meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the question of the relocation of the Director-General of the SDG, Colegova, as shown by the Government's agenda.
Colegovi VID leaders were headed by Minister of Finance Reizniece-Ozola after Inara Petersone resigned from the service’s management and the competition for the Director-General of the VID expired without a result.
On Thursday, August 11, the VID manager's poster Dace Pelēka allowed the Latvian Radio interview - if she had been offered to stand as a driver, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that other candidates for the Head of the VID were not considered.
Raivis Dzintars, the Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, also recognised that NA was still in favour of the Colegovi VID.
In Spain, the potential for reducing the deficit is threatened by the inability to set up a government.
Before 12 July of the month, the European Commission (EC) gave its opinion that Spain and Portugal have not taken sufficient measures to reduce the deficit to 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
The calculations show that, despite the austerity measures implemented, the deficit in Portugal was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year and 5.1% in Spain.
However, the European Commission decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while setting fiscal targets for the near future.
One of the reasons why the EC does not, however, impose sanctions on both countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only multiply such negative mood.
The Critics point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions, from the outset by agreeing on common rules and subsequently failing to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, stated that Europe is losing confidence in itself by creating the people's perception that the European Union's rules are recommended rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed, and all Member States have confirmed, extending the deficit recovery period until the end of this year to Portugal and Spain until 2018.
The European Commission promises to check the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce additional austerity measures if circumstances so require.
The initial projections show that Portugal's target could be achieved within the set timeframe and that the deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of gross domestic product already this year.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, this country's government needs to implement savings measures of 0.25 % of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, with an additional focus on controlling the purchase costs of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complex.
This year, the deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, the consolidation measures should be 0.5% of GDP annually in the next two years.
The fact that the Spanish political parties have not been able to agree on establishing a government for eight months makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives, and it is increasingly possible that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time of the year.
However, public opinion surveys show that the political picture of the third elections in the country would not be significantly changed.
The most popular party is still the people's party, chaired by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, who would again obtain a total of 33% of the votes in the elections.
Only socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the popularity of Podemos or Ciudadados, or Pilsoņi, are slightly diminished against austerity measures.
The People's Party wants to get socialists and Ciudadanos involved in the government in this month, otherwise it will not be possible to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval the draft budget for 2017 by mid-October.
As announced by Rafael Hernando, the representative of the People's Party's Parliamentary Group, if the government fails and the parliamentary elections will still be held for the third time, Spain will become a ridicule for Europe as a whole.
The cleanness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
In the fifth year of the beache survey, activists concluded that, unfortunately, the number of waste found has increased annually, and the majority of the bathing sites are guilty of the guilty.
The most polluted bathing areas are directly in Riga.
The city council explains that swimming places are maintained every day, but fighting unclean visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, the waste left on land during rainfall can be rinsed in water, thereby significantly damaging its quality.
Except for Liepaja beach and separate places in Kurzeme, the purity of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This has been distributed this week by volunteers from the "My Sea" campaign.
When the fifth year walks along the Gulf of Riga, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this assessment of criticism has taken place this year.
"We see that this is the year when the number of wastes on the beach can probably even exceed 200 units", says the representative of the expedition "My Sea" Jānis Ulme.
Latvian Radio called, he was located in the Town Beach, where the voluntary walk along the Gulf of Riga will continue.
This year, we had to collect even daily light bulbs left in sea sands between various household wastes and picnics.
The member and organiser Ulme say that the polluting populations are blamed directly.
"The main source is the beach visitors, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various wastes, ranging from bags, plastic pieces that are already at the stage of degradation, are no longer possible to identify them, and to spills, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the most dirty beaches are also bathing places in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriva, almost 800 units of waste have been collected on average per hundred metres, which is critical.
The organisers of the campaign also explain that there are also exquisites and not every step of warning or banning signs.
"The average figures for all three Riga swimming sites together - Daugavgrivu, Western bulls and grandparents - are unfortunately reaching large and far above the desired goal, as if Latvia is moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", the environmental defender concludes.
Cleaning of bathing areas in Riga every day, in the hotest summer days even twice, explains the representative of the council Uģis Iekškis.
However, the fight against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We are returning to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who apolate, consume alcohol, smoke and do all things that cannot, even special signs do not work," says Internalis.
Therefore, Internalis invites bathing visitors to report polluters to the police.
You can call the police, safely point out these violations, and in this way all fight.
Maybe you can put some new warnings, but, as I said, it would hardly change the situation radically.
"However, everyone should simply turn together and be intolerant to such offenders," he stresses.
Meanwhile, the water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by a Health Inspectorate, which may prohibit official bathing sites.
This year, like next year, the quality of water is good and satisfactory everywhere.
At present, the quality of water has always been good in all 56 bathing areas and there are no bathing restrictions.
"The last time we will take analysis at the end of August," says the Senior Specialist of the Inspectorate on Environmental Health Normunds Kadiks.
During heavy rainfalls, land-based waste may be rinsed in water.
This may, in turn, affect its quality by an environmental specialist.
Rotations in the Russian elite continue - change of manager in Putina administration.
Is he leaving office?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this post and will be the President's special representative for nature protection, ecological and transport.
When Putin announced the changes, he gave to Ivanov the commendable words: "Dear Sergei Borisovič, we have worked together with you for many years and do so successfully."
I am satisfied with how you carry out your duties.
I remember well about our agreement not to use you in this position as Head of Administration of the President for more than four years.
I am therefore conscious of your wish to change the field.
And I hope that you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience in the new post.
However, it is highlighted that the management of the President's administration is a very important position and has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the elections of the State Council in Russia are expected next month, the fears that this step is linked to the fight for power in the political elite of Russia have been highlighted.
Ivanov was also called a possible Vice-President of Putin, so the assertion that he himself wanted to take office as President for nature protection and transport issues raised doubts.
According to the archives of Lsm.lv, Ivanov is the General Assembly of the KGB and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an ancient and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his work in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the Head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, at the end of the reign of the First President of Russia, Boris Jelcina was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council.
In 2000, after Putina came to power, the "Information Security Doctrine" developed by Ivanova was confirmed, which included the rehabilitation of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became a Russian Minister of Defence, but already in 2005 he was responsible for the development of Russian defence companies and arms exports.
Now, after the Presidential Head of Administration, Ivanov will also remain a place in the Russian National Security Council, where there will now be a new president of the President's Administration Vaino.
The guilt comes from the family party in the elite.
Ivanov himself recommended the position of Presidential Head of Administration Vaino.
And Anthony Eduardovič and I have long known.
Another of the times when we worked under your government.
And in the last almost five years we communicate practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that in all the professional and personal qualities he is ready for this work", said Ivanovs.
The guilt comes from a family belonging to the elite of the Soviet party.
His grandfather Carl took up high posts in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988.
The Internet publication "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonia's self-determination and independence" says that at the end of the 1980s Karl Vaino has asked Moscow to authorise the use of force against demonstrators.
However, he received a refusal and shortly lost his office.
Shortly afterward, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Anton Vaino has graduated the Moscow Institute of International Relations and manages Japanese language.
However, he has gone from the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's minutes.
It has already been said that the last unsuccessful displacement and even arrests of several senior officials, including the replacement of the governors and federal representatives of several regions, have hit Russia.
According to politologes, President Vladimir Putin reorganises the governing elite before the forthcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features is that the representatives of force structures are increasingly involved in leading positions.
Nikiforenko also loses the killer in the first battle of the Olympic Games.
This was the first round of the fight, and the Latvian Judgids Crown has concluded its participation in the Olympic Games by finishing the 17th place.
Coach Oleg Baskin recognized for Latvian Television that the hope of Nikiforenko was very little, and it was already clear before the competition.
He also discovered that the junior was injured in the battle.
Significantly, in order to be a sign of the Olympic Roadmap, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - that is, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijan’s cave was 25 pounds heavier.
It has already been reported that Jevgeņiy in Borodavko’s fight for up to 100 pounds against Rjunosuki lasted two and a half minutes until the opponent had a worthy shot of pure victory.
Latvia has therefore concluded the jump competition in Rio.
The dreams disappear in Rio sand.
The Thursday was entered by the Junior Yevgeny Borodavko.
Yes, he had a more pronounced opponent, but the ambitiouss are sometimes able to bring a surprise.
He didn't.
The task of Arture Nikiforenko was even more complex, because the experience is smaller and the opponent is also respectful.
The result is similar, although he kept the tattoo for just one and a half minutes longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, in recent times, the Latvian Judists lack the most ambitious.
Since Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial stunt Vladimirs Šestakovs went from Latvia to Alexander Jackevičs, there is no longer "Golden Score", the joy development runs along a downward curve.
Jackevich, who advises Kazakhstan's joysts here, and Wsevold Zelonia doesn't see the heirs.
But if they don't grow, they won't.
And that's the federation's prerogative.
Therefore, as from another galaxy in "Rite panoramic" the President of the Latvian Judo Federation promised Rio to win medals.
Flight far from reality.
On the evening we waited for the beach volleyball match Samoilov/Smēdiņš - Evandrs/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga as already in the "death" group - losers of games ended.
Latvia's duvet had a small derogation - it could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was yet grown in a long previous game.
Nobody wanted to die - this feeling was shaken over the wind cord all the way.
For players, the bright wind created additional difficulties.
At first it seemed that it could be an alliance of ours, which is more comprehensive.
But he didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duet here.
Serve so on Samoilov and wait when he's going to break.
Toward Canada, Cuba broke up at the end of the first set and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not on the joke.
The champion could be fishing at that time, because the work was little, but when it was, he did it for honor.
The Brazilians Samoilov with Shaddine were able to win in two sets, because the first took the lead with 16:15, but 16 were also left by exhausting the limit of lost points.
But could also be lost with 0:2, because the second set of deficits was -4, however, also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third was already on the Evandra serpent.
The chain was formed - unconvincingly accepted service, the second bucket often flies too close to the network, and Samoilov remained very few options for a successful attack.
If there were some strange Samoilov in the area against the cubicians, then this time he was more successful, and only on Sasa to novelt the loss would be non-professional.
Kreil was also wrong, and quite symbolic that he tried the last ball block.
The team is lost.
This time, there was certainly a lack of success: in the third set alone, two Evandra attacks almost fled out of the card, but the ball, however, hit the line.
Two moves were next to the line.
The videos of the controversial episodes also decided in favour of opponents.
If in the first two games Evandra was mocked with reserves, they were very productive against us.
All sumed in the loss on the tab.
The causes of failure must now be analysed calmly.
Maybe we had to live as many as next to the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It took two and a half hours.
Maybe a little self-confidence was given by seven semi-finals.
Perhaps you shouldn't have played in Clagenfurt, but come here sooner and get better to acclimate.
Maybe there was a mistake in finding the top of the sports form.
We have yet to ask more questions than answers.
Our bishops' games have ended.
The dream of medals is over.
What else?
There are still some World Cup Tournaments and also Jūrmala Masters.
The shot with Samoilov has never been or will not have been friends in life because there are too different personalities.
But it is not necessary to do so.
When the dream of the Olympic medals has collapsed, it can also be thought of divorce because the guilt will be sought not only in itself but also in the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but it will be much harder to find a decent partner in Latvia.
For both brothers, John and Thomas have already tried and separated, and Michael Samoilov is still too green to start conquering the world’s peaks.
You can try Harald Regju, Alexander Solovie, Edgar Toch, to return to Martiņš Pieviņš, but it will not be better than this option, which did not just show itself once at the stages of the World Cup.
The cooking sand wasn't smiling for them this time.
And everything.
Of course, we also need to take into account the fact that the beach volleyball becomes more popular, the circumferential flows into new couples, and only the rare height is less than two metres.
It does not yet guarantee success but is an essential argument in the fight for winning.
We don't stay longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the places offered by the players, as well as to choose their own.
U.S. basketball selection lives on a cruise ship, some tennisists do not stay in the Olympic village.
Also, some volleyballs of the beach have found a hotel in Copenhagen.
This time, prices were exaggerated for quite modest accommodations offered to journalists.
Therefore, the choice also fell to the rent of apartments.
The risk is because sometimes they may be uncomfortable from a logistic point of view.
This time the risk justifies.
With Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the border of Kopakabana and Ipanem.
The beach is 200 meters away, the beach is in a half an hour walk.
The district is quite safe, because the favelas are besides, but there must not be a wake-up here too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some immediately imagine, but professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. looks like another medal dream was dreamed on Friday morning.
Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa, at 100 metres in the barrier run and high attack, is lagging behind her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of break "Porgey and Besa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, opera "Porgiy and Besa" was experienced in 1973 in the National Opera of Latvia.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been re-emerged.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsis Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the listeners the opportunity to enjoy George Gēršvina's master.
"We are delighted that after the last 10 years of break, when Liepaja was able to enjoy the installation of the opera, the version of the concert session of this great George Gērsvina "Porgiy and Besa" opera is pleasing to us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Lielais dzintars", says Baiba Bož.
Opera "Porgiy and Besa" is a bright musical story about love, its volatility, passion, as well as household tragedies and simple daily joy.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
That is the lack of political correction in this operation, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says the director, Viestur Kairišs.
What I like most - listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stop points - famous melodies, famous motives, but these transitions from one character to another, illuminated by one personage or another personage, or choirs, or orchestras.
"This is the most exciting, this building", the opera is rated by the musical leader and conductor of the opera "Porgijs un Besa" concert program Andris Poga.
Visitors of the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear this world's famous Guarshwin Opera.
Blessed, Liepaja can feel the breath of the world.
"Failure professional", the opera is rated by the visitor Edgars Lāms.
The concert was special with the fact that the newly opened concert hall "Lielais dzintaris" played the orchestra in the orchestra bed for the first time and the concert of the opera took place.
The area at the Museum of Art could be named on behalf of Janis Rozentāls.
At the opening of the exhibition of the Rosental jubilee, Riga Vice-Merman Andris America stated that the museum's own address could also be not the Boardmāra street of Krišjānis 10a, but the Janis Rosentāls square 1.
Director of the museum Māra Lāce acknowledged that re-registration of the address would create a heavy bureaucratic burden, but generally welcomed this idea and therefore accepted the municipal proposal.
The city of Riga has placed a stone of some kind to this idea in 1936, creating the Burkarda Dzeni monument to Janim Rozental, who stands at the museum.
Vilhelm Purvītis, the director of the museum, was one of the initiators of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I have a little conscience all the time - but Willhelm Purvītis, where will we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said Lace.
It is reported that the National Museum of Art has officially opened its doors in May after an ambitious reconstruction and modernisation.
This week will finally start the reconstruction of the VEF Culture Palace.
The castle will be renewed by SIA "Velve" for about 11 million euros.
It is planned to renovate several rooms of the castle, including two rooms for viewers, as well as to adapt the building to people with reduced mobility.
The Riga Council intends to attract the European Union funds of six million euros to the project, but Oleg Burov, Director of the Riga Council Property Department, recognises that there is still no complete clarity about the European funds for the project.
"Despite the political willingness to start repairs of the VEF Culture Palace by attracting the European Structural Funds, we are waiting for months for a decision, real action from officials of the Ministry of Finance, will be allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you should make your own decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
At the moment, we see that there is once again another circle of discussions, now we will see what we can expect in the coming days.
"I can say that the Riga Council surely guarantees that this process will be initiated and completed in time", says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Palace collectively organized a detached concert immediately before the renovation of the near future building.
Although the year has passed, the renovation of the building was still not started and continued collectively under inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga Council Department of Property, the renovation of the VEF Palace of Culture is divided into seemingly independent combinations of reconstruction works, where each will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the availability of the VEF Culture Palace and improve the surrounding area.
It envisages arranging the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as restoring the facades of the building.
Second - Improving the supply of services by the VEF Culture Castle.
It plans to improve the interior, wall and ceiling restoration of the building, stage and sound recording studio, as well as to organize the internal engineering communications of the building.
Thirdly, improving collective working conditions for creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of the Līvu, the legendary rock group can be found at the exhibition in Liepāja.
The exhibition will include various items characterising the "Lives" - photos that are arranged in the timeline to reflect the group's activities from the beginning until 2010 when the end of the group's activities is announced.
The participants' stage clothes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be displayed, as well as other things not yet visible to the wider public that reflected the creative activities of the group "Live".
The exhibition will be supplemented by the items of the Liepaja Museum's stock.
The visual presentation of the exhibition was made in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalniece.
Also musicians who were associated with the "Lives" group and their relatives responded to the call and shared both objects and memories.
The beginnings of "Livas" can be founded in 1972 when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pavitols, is created in Liepaja Culture House.
The ensemble participated in the festival "Liepājas dzintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the city and Republic views.
In 1976, a delicate meeting took place when Juris Pavitols met Erika Ķiģelis and Metalurgical Culture Palace founded a group inviting him to join Ingrīdu Gūtmani, Andri Kuziņš and Jānis Grodums.
Over the years, the composition of the group has been me more than once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - the desire to prove that Latvian Rocket is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What did you see - jeans, mathentias and orphans, these boys were impressively different from the generally accepted stereotype of the estrad," musical surveyor Klāss Vāvere says about the group.
In addition to the musicians mentioned above, such outstanding musicians as Igo, Vilnius Krieviņš, Modris Šterns, Valdis Štarks, Laimis Racennieks, Tolis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brīze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomass Kleins and many others have worked in the group.
Access to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition is from August 19 to October 30.
On 27 August Liepaja Concert Garden "Pūt, vējš" will take place in the group "Lyvi" 40-year anniversary celebration "Livifest 2".
For the first time in 8 months, inflation is observed in Bulgaria.

This is the highest since 2012 and the first indicator above zero since October of the previous year, when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after the PCI in the last 12 months (August-2016) compared to the previous year was -0.8%.
The consumer price index was 101.9% in July 2016 and the monthly average inflation was 1.0% compared to the previous year.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation rate was -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, the price increase was observed in July 2016 for the following groups of consumer goods: foods and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural events (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices for clothing and footwear decreased (2.2%); housing equipment, household appliances and regular household cleaning (0.5%); health (0.1%).

Zbigņev Stankevich: Come time, and the truth rises up.
The Archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia metropolitis Zbigņevs Stankevičs in an interview Independently stresses that if we want to gain strength in life, the Gospel message should be placed at its centre.
For the power of truth is greater than the unity of evil.
Many are already on the way to the celebrations of the Most Holy Mary in the heavens of Aglon.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, a pope's nuance has expressed the desire to lead the main service in Aglon.
The main message is therefore also the content of his message.
It is also the fact that the crossroads are run by the Bishop John Bull.
He will also make his own message.
Last day, I led a feast vigilance service.
Last year I focused on the French encyclics "Laudato si" of the Pope and updated the total house, the Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course I watched what is happening in the world and I tried to respond to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with the church’s suggestion that the Gospel message should be placed at the heart of life.
It should be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of man’s life and gives him inspiration for the next journey.
Then it talks to people.
But in Cēsis, at Lampa's discussion, you said that "returning to the understanding of the full man".
What do you mean?
Does that mean that a person turns away from the church message?
And does the church today have such a return resource?
In the capital of India, a man dying on the roadside is rinsed.
In the capital of India, nobody has said any idea of a deadly nut man on the roadside - it turns out that he has deposited the roadside for an hour and then washed out, informs BBC.
A man identified as Matibull has been reported to have traveled a harsh day and worked as a guard at night.
5:30 in the morning went to the house on the way, when he was taken by a light car.
The observation camera record shows that the driver went out of the car to see the victim, and then went.
After an hour when no one told anybody about the bleeding man, he was rinsed by a napkin.
About 90 minutes after the accident, the police arrived and the victim was delivered to a hospital where he died of the injuries.
By revoking its nomination to the post of Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID), Inga Koļegova, Head of the State Environmental Service, will liberate the government from falling, the Associate Professor Ojārs Skudra of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia is considered.
The explanation of the withdrawal of the candidate in relation to contradictions in the ruling coalition is linked to the fact that she has prevented the fall of the government.
The Scudra talk with the agency LETA stated that it was difficult for him to imagine that during the next week's government meeting "Unity" would support Colegov's candidacy.
Consequently, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but Colegov was approved so, it would lead to a government demise.
The expert also considers that before the cancellation notice, Kolegova has consulted both the Minister of Finance Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and Prime Minister Māri Kučinski.
At the same time, it is also a concession on the 'Unity' which has strongly opposed her candidacy.
By predicting whether the competition will succeed in finding a suitable candidate, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be selected, or the institution will continue to lead Dace Pelek as the Director-General.
At the same time, he points out that if the Minister of Finance so far claimed that another candidacy had not been examined, it was a house for Peak that it was not allowed to participate in the competition.
LETA has already stated that the Head of the State Environmental Service, Kolegova, has decided to withdraw his nomination for the post of Director General of the VID.
For the sake of unity, the Government postponed the approval of Colegova on Tuesday to a week as Director-General of the VID.
Following the Government's decision to postpone the decision, Collegovo confirmed its readiness to become the Head of the SDG.
However, she later changed her thoughts - on Friday's application to the Minister of Finance, Dana Reisniece-Ozola, she pointed out that she had withdrawn her consent to the transfer to the Head of the VID and that she had no easy choice.
The press secretary of Prime Minister Māris Kučinskis, Andrejs Vaivars, explained to the LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of the Director-General for VID.
An accident took place in the center of Riga involving a police car.
In the center of Riga, this afternoon a road accident involving the State Police Car occurred.
The police car with on-line sound and light signals has hurried to the highest category call, until the crossing of Krišjānis Barons and Dzirnavu streets collapsed with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the original information shows that the other spector has not missed the police car.
A woman in an accident.
This year the number of people in Riga decreased
At the beginning of this year, there were 638 784 inhabitants in Riga, which is 0,34% less than in 2015, when 641 000 people were officially registered in the capital, the LETA of the agencies informed the Central Statistical Authority (CSP).
In terms of the population, the capital of Latvia ranks in 30th place between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the large cities where the population exceeds one million.
According to Eurostat, the largest proportion of women is in Riga - the capital of Latvia is convincingly first among the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three Baltic capitals, there is the largest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities: in Vilnius they are 123, while in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
Alert pictograms will be displayed at the LNMM.
In the nearest days, the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM) will display warning signs - icons, the LETA was told by Baiba Gailīte, representative of the Riga Council Property Department.
At the moment, the Museum's glazed glazing has successfully completed the repair of the rapid damage resulting from the operation of skeitbords.
The warning pictograms will be displayed on the nearest days.
It will tell its citizens that the coverage is often slippery during rain and snow, it must not move by cars, and also visit bicycles, roller skates and rollerboards.
About this social network Facebook was also written by Ushakov, who pointed out that no safety hazards are caused by damage, but "they look unaware", and the skeitbords will "be healed".
Festivals for children and parents- New playgrounds for children are installed in Riga.
In this summer season, the municipality of Riga installed two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Ciekurkalna, which are already available for children.
The Kipsala beach is equipped with a wide, multifunctional toy ship with various sheltering elements, bridges, games, trubs and sliding mountains.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
Swings and different balancing elements are also installed in the field.
The world of Phantasia for small sailors is filled with an attraction position on the Daugava coast with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships there.
In turn, the playground between the Ciekurkalns 4th and 5th crossline is equipped with a game house, a bat, a stepway track, a balance bridge, swings, play balls and other elements of the game, as well as a exercise area with rings of force and coordination exercises, tracks, etc.
The rubber covering is covered under the field in different colours.
A new, coloured brush cover is enclosed from the street to the playground.
The reconstructed road phase has been discovered in the honeys.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, management of the VAS Latvian Roads (LVC), as well as representatives of the builders SIA "Benders" and municipalities today opened the reconstructed state road border Russia (Grebņeva) -Rēzekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border (Medumi) (A13) phase from Medams to Lithuania's border (156,4-163,05 km).
The roads are a national visit plan, especially the border routes, so a special pleasure is to discover a reconstructed stage at the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of improving the situation on national roads thanks to co-financing of European Union funds.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for the roads will be learned already in 2018 and we have to think how to continue maintaining the most burdened roads in very good quality and also to ensure the mobility of the population in all regions of Latvia without funding from the European Union", Uldis Augulis emphasised by turning the symbolic tape.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that the proposals prepared by the traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads will be presented to the government in the meantime.
The construction works were started last year from Medems to Lithuania's border (156,4.-163.05. km) SIA Benders started and continued this year after a technological break.
Reconstruction costs amount to EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed stage of the road the construction of the road is fully rebuilt and the next year the repair works will be started in the next stage from Medams to Daugavpils, which will result in all the routes from the border of Lithuania to Daugavpils," said Jānis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The country's main roads are most congested, and by 2018 we intend to ensure that all its main roads are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, ensuring timely periodic maintenance and the replacement of asphalt superficials every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travellers look forward with hope to the proposals put forward by the expert group to arrange the road financing system," Lange noted.
As part of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the hunting centre.
Significant groundworks have been carried out: four phases of large-scale refreshment and large-scale recording and burial works, smoothed road long profile, which was so far very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been rebuilt and a rebuilt roll-over area for public transport.
In the past, the road had insufficient volatility and the terrain was not transparent because of mountain valleys, as well as the old path to the common terrain.
The next works season plans to restore the road section from the Daugavpils border to the reconstructed stage (144.80-156.40 km).
This year LVC plans to perform various types of works in more than 1100 kilometres of national roads.
Information on all repairs planned in the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight-loss results, the right choice of food combinations is very important", acknowledges Lithuanian dietist Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriene.
In addition, it is easy to do during the summer season, when fresh fruit, berries and vegetables grow in our gardens.
A balanced combination of dietary products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also target the various processes of the body.
Macaroni and vinegar are a successful combination because they provide a long-lasting house sensation and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a positive effect on blood glucose levels and helps us feel mourning.
Cayene peppers and protein-rich meals such as poultry meat or protein cocktail not only give you a feeling of food, but also reduce your cravings after a large meal in the next meal.
Such a combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal to 35%.
Research shows that Caien peppers can help to get rid of fat in the abdomen area.
Eggs contain a metabolic nutrient, choline, while paprika is a good source of vitamin C.
When taking enough of these nutrients, the cortisol level can be reduced and thus the accumulation of fat around the middle part of the body may be reduced.
Oats’ flakes with fresh berries include another delicious and fat - burning meal for breakfast, which is worth adding to your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fibers that, according to the conclusions of Canadian scientists, control the sensation of grelin - an appetite stimulating hormone - and thus hunger.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols that are aids in weight reduction and also prevent the formation of fats.
Vegetables and proteins are also able to perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of creating a sense of house.
Vegetables contain water and fibers, thus contributing to the sense of the house.
At the same time, the protein slows down the digestion process and provides a sensation of the urine for a longer period of time.
On lunch you can eat chickens with salads or prepare protein cocktails from the finished mixture and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Some combinations of products should be avoided.
The fruits contain sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, the starch in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit divides into the stomach mechanically, while chemically it does not divide until the third or fourth degree of digestion occurs in the intestine.
The starch breaks down in three different stages, which begins already in the mouth.
It is therefore important not to eat sweet meals immediately after a meal.
To eat sweet food immediately after a meal, it is "closed" in the stomach together with other dishes where it is not chemically digested and starts to blow.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dateles or other carbohydrates together with lemons, happiness, oranges, grapefruit, pineapples or other acidic fruit.
The enzyme ptialine, located in saliva, works only in the alkaline environment.
Fruit acids inhibit not only carbohydrate digestion but also their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheeses and eggs or cheeses and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and similar combinations of protein-rich products in one meal.
Different digestive juices, each of which have different strengths, characteristics and time to enter the stomach, are required for their processing.
Arbūz, medusmelone, muskatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons shall not be digested if they are found in the stomach together with other foods.
Fat in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat is a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said about fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If you consume a large amount of protein-containing products, avoid fat intake at all.
This also applies to freshing - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of nuts (containing proteins) with whole avocado (containing fat).
This combination inhibits effective weight reduction.
How better to prepare?
"Eat preparation, heat treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the initial nutrient content of the products", says the dietologist.
In most cases nutrients are lost by cooking foods in water.
However, the value of some food nutrients increases by direct boiling.
After cooking the remaining liquid is recommended for soup preparation – in this case you will not lose the nutrients remaining in water and you will be able to eat it later.
Vegetables are recommended to be prepared also by steaming them.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of lycopene contained in tomatoes.
When cooking tomatoes for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
The thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of betacarotene in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The heat treatment of eggs and meat shall remove the natural properties of the proteins contained therein, making them more easily digestible.
The heat treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbable in the body.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of products can reduce vitamin C from 10% to 90%, but the freezing of fibre does not affect.
Beans in combination with tomatoes may increase iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body takes up to 33% of non-haemorrhagic iron found in herbal products such as beans, leaves, cereal products than bloody iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-haemorrhagic iron in your body when taking food products containing non-haemorrhagic iron together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps to change the non-haemorrhagic iron to make it more easily absorbed by our body.
Iron is necessary for the production of haemoglobin, which ensures the delivery of oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To maximise the benefits of salad, add healthy fats such as olive or linseed oil.
When preparing a lot of butter with a laser, add a vitamin D-rich lasime or sardine-free yogurt that is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and plays an important role in the bone formation process.
Oats (and other whole grain products) together with vitamin C sources such as strawberries, rivers, raspberries and other fruits or berries help to stabilise cholesterol levels and avoid arteries blocking.
The effect of Snapchat Anime criticizes the cartouring of Asians
The representatives of Snapchat say that this filter has been inspired by animation, but some commentants claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change the reality and play with their identity in an absurd way every day.
You can turn yourself into an ananasus, a dog or a image that fits Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are fog, image distorting tools that generate more than 30 million transformed selfies per day.
Any error will quickly become public noticeable.
Snapchat lens effects have already been criticised in the past, receiving the rejections that the application promotes too black or light facial skin tones as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, new lens effects were published, allowing users to form the eyes of chips, dental shades and round cheeks, and some critics named it as racist oaks – “yellow faints”.
It was also asked whether such contradictions did not indicate that the company had more problems with diversity.
The news and public negatives emanated on Wednesday when the publications The Verge and Motherboard stated that the lens effects have been removed from the application.
The company explained that the aim of the lens was to portray the image of Anime, not to caricate people of Asian origin.
However, those who experienced racism reminded them of the painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the similarity with Anime.
In an e-mail she notes that the lens effects are "injurious and uncomfortable not to say more".
She added that it is difficult not to notice the visible similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the infinite fight for diversity and inclusion, ranging from business meetings rooms to Hollywood and devices that we use every day.
And the great audience of Snapchat young people, representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lens creates an image that hurts users, then "in modern times such things remain unnoticed", in Thursday interview expressed Keitija Žou, 25 years old.
On Thursday, the manager of Media products Žou erased his Snapchat application and recommended that others do the same.
In her article “Medium” and the telephone interview she explained that, in her opinion, problems related to race are due to the employment policy of Snapchat, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Žou criticised the company's management, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"It means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether some other racial representatives are working in the company, but they do not take such a position to be safe and comfortable to express their views," says the Chinese American Jacques.
She also agrees with others, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many races represent the employee, stating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative found that the company had hired a staff member who would focus on representing the company of racial minorities, which were not widely represented and would facilitate inclusion in the company.
On the other hand, I would not renew my Snapchat account, adding: "It's interesting if they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The Congress Chamber declares that military officials have distorted the reports on the Islamic State.
In a statement published on Thursday, the Chamber of Congress notes that the U.S. Central Command has distorted the reports, representing the war against Islamic country in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than is actually the case.
The analysts of the Central Command Intelligence Service express their general dissatisfaction with the temporary report of the team of the members of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defence Financing Sub-Committee, indicating that their management controlled reports on American contributions to the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, overseeing the US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news of this report tells us that intelligence reports, approved by the Higher Centcom leaders, reflect the US fight against terrorism more positive than in fact. The facts were regularly amended to reflect better achievements than other intelligence analyses.
Mr California's representative, Ken Kalvert, says: "Centcom's action is unacceptable: our soldiers are those who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are searched for under the authority of the organisation.
This 10-page report reflects in detail the existing problems in the reflection of the Central Command and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide compelling evidence that the oldest officials of Obama's administration would have distorted the reports, it shows that Centcom's leadership has made some pressure on analysts to display a more optimistic view of the threats posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the publications, statements and reports of the Central Governance press represented the situation in a much more positive light than in fact.
For example, Centcom's representatives publicly announced that Mosulas's recovery operation could start already in April or May 2015.
Mosula is the second largest city of Iraq, still under the control of Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, representative of the Cansas Republican Party, says in his report: "Inquiry over several months clearly confirms this."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the US Central Governance Heads distorted the reports reflecting the threat of ISIS in Iraq weaker than they were in fact.
The Republican Party set up a working group to learn that analysts are concerned that information about Islamic country is being amended.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will follow new findings in this case.
The General Inspection of the Ministry of Defence shall carry out an investigation of the activities of the Centcom intelligence service.
Members of the Democratic Party of the Intelligence Management Committee published their own report on Thursday, in which they agreed to some conclusions of the Republican Party Working Group.
The democratic representative, Adams B. Šifs, reported in his report that Centcom was too limited from 2014 to 2015 to the preparation of intelligence assessment reports in relation to the ISIS and Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr Šifa explains that this process "has stopped disseminating information", deteriorated the work ethics of analysts and "distributed truthless facts."
But Shif and the members of the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has made pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports in line with the 'predetermined or political position'.
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the General Inspectorate of Pentagon initiated an investigation following complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant-General for Pentagon, Patrik Evan, stated that Pentagon would not comment on the convention report until investigations were continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data differently, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Administration calls for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to the question whether the American-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement expressed by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations call into question whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot points.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reminds us of more than ten years of events when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hūker published a study, claiming that George V.Bush's administration began Afghanistan's war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
He also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic state intelligence issue.
Last year, official representatives reported that Hūker's team revealed that, contrary to public reports, air flights to Islamic State Oil Plants did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary plants to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not outside the central management walls.
At that time, Centcom Commander General Loids Ostins III received a sharp criticism because many lawmakers thought that the war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Ostin was vacationed and General Joseph L. Votel came to place him.
In the United States duele with Britain, women in the field of the choke, win the United States, thus gaining a fourth success in a row.
On the day after victory over Japan with score 6:1, Thursday Katey Bama won the first two gates for the US female field of the hokey team, when Americans won the Indian team with score 3:0.
Five gate gains in two games are unforgettable achievements, but 27 years old Bama said that she could not remember whether that was what she had ever succeeded.
She said, "I have no idea."
I am not the people who count their gates.
But she knows that the American result in the Olympic Games is 4:0, which gives them in their group unresolved with Britain, which Thursday after victory over Japan with the result 2:0 remained unfortunate.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last matches in the first round of games.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the group of six teams and whose second.
The first winner will avoid meeting with the strong Dutch leader in the second group for a little longer.
Although the Saturday game would not develop, Americans have already called a surprise storm four years ago, taking the last place in London between 12 teams.
It also included Bama
She grew up in Blubel, the field hokeja bat she first took her hands at the age of 3 (her oldest twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Draxel) and she joined the national selection when she was 16 years old, becoming the newest player of the sample.
She wasn't on the 2008 Olympics because she wasn't in the finals.
But 2012 was unsuccessful to her and her team.
In the following year, coal Craig Parham was appointed as a random coach and everything changed to the right.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical change."
In London, we did not invest as much work as we are now.
We have changed everything completely.
In the Thursday game Bama discovered the result by obtaining the gates in the first half of the time with the back of the weld from the nearby distance.
India started without victory in its account, but their selection was very rigorous and kept the minimum result of 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama re-catched the gates.
She entered the ball into the anti-injection zone along the left side of the area, then noticed being on the middle part of the area and broadcast the ball in the counter-injection gate, by directing the Americans under 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzalesa received another gate.
This was the first US gateguard Jackie Brig dry game in each of the first three games in one gate.
She's fallen.
And like Bama.
"We are now going very well," said Paham, but as well as well, show the game Saturday.
The most depressive meal for the depression period is "Soft meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of the President, Franklin Delano Rūzvelt sat in the oval room to hold a meal.
President Ruzvelt was tasted by fine cooking delicates such as a goose liver paste or fuagre and a Merilend turtle soup.
But that day his meal was much modest: filled with eggs in tomato sauce, potato thick and dessert - plum puddle.
Jane Ziegelmane says: "This is the way to solidarity in cooking with people who were very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Kou, adds: "This is also a message to the Americans, as they should eat."
A couple of the Brooklyn Heights district is food historians.
The last book of Kou "Garden Sautums" describes the Chinese kitchen in America, and Ziegelmane describes life through a meal in the east of Manheten, in his book "97 Abeles".
Their new joint work "A saturated meal," which will be published on Tuesday by the publisher Harper, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Exercising some solidarity in the culinary, they kept the meal together by the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunch catering in the district of Flatiron and operating from 1929 when the great depression began.
Ms. Ziegelmanes, 54 years old, ordered a sandwich with melted cheese and fried olives, while Kou, 57 years old, ordered turkeys, potato thicks and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered the falsified goat, a couple acknowledged that his choice was very appropriate for the conversation about the Great Depression time meal.
Ms Ziegelmanes said that the falsified bitch was very popular.
There was a peanut, a liver roast and a bean roast.
They were made of basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine how it is – eating so many peanuts so that they are in the place of lunch.
Mr. Kou was worried.
"Surely it seemed that the abdomen was full of lead," he added.
In the years of pre-depression, the American lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women prepared to eat their husbands-workers and breakfast, fresh meals were served in lunch and dinner.
During the first World War, the Americans sent a meal to Europeans. The "Soft meal" described how the Americans adapted to the circumstances when America suddenly was no longer a land of superpiln.
"Then the meal became the main focus of the American people every day," says Mr Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write exactly about this subject.
The new budget diets became just as important: such unknown dishes as the falsified goat and the sauces became everyday, the sauces were "a great way to use the surpluses," noted Ms Ziegelmanes, because the cook could hide the unattractive ingredients under the creamy sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the main ingredient of American meals for years, has now become an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when the number of calories and foods were more important than the taste, there were new, yet unseen formations.
In an ancient cooking book, Ms Ziegelmanes found a recipe for the preparation of peanut butter-filled onions.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular supplement to the lunch table."
Ms Ziegelmane stresses: 'It was a sirreal'.
Peanut butter and cooked onion are not compatible.
Many home food recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Luīze Stenlija, the head of the Federal Household Economic Office from 1923 to 1943, identified state eating habits that were not experienced before or after the Great Depression.
When publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended households to become "economy" and accept challenges such as to convert macaroni and carrots into a delicious meal.
"Soft Maltette" is a loveliest of historical deliciousness.
It is particularly interesting to show the government's attitude toward its hungry citizens, for example, President Herbert Huver's 'Let me eat cake'.
Although he publicly spoke about his simple childhood and eating in Aiova, in fact he was eating as a fine millionaire about whom he had become.
Mr Kou says: "They liked a European kitchen, such as a fish with a cucumbers' sauce."
He was eating almost a yellow tower, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely distracted from reality.
President Ruzvelt would have made the same mistake, unless his wife, Eleonora, recommended that he set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells us that Ruzvelt has hired a homeworker who did not teach him to eat, so the White House became a place "where not only was served one of the most delicious dishes in Washington, but also the poorest dishes".
As soon as the country’s economy regained, most of the culinary signatures of the Depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, and to how to apply science in culinary, Ms Ziegelmane added.
A couple tells us that when writing the book, they became more aware of Ms. Ziegelmane’s mother’s eating habits, for example, why she was unable to throw out food.
"He was really afraid to throw out the meal," Mr. Kou said.
Mrs Ziegelmane said, "It was actually trapped by people."
There was an incident with wind cakes once.
When we were eating at the Eysenberg editorial, a couple of writers pulled out the dessert made from the bag home: a plum puddle that President Ruzvelt used to eat in lunch.
"It is a plums foam," said Ms Ziegelmanes, adding that at the time there was a common habit of giving a shiny name to modest dishes.
It does not contain foam, only dried plums, slight flour, sugar, water and cane.
Everyone insisted on the spoon in the brown mass on the plates.
Suddenly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr Kou eats a few more cousins.
Speaking of an experienced "ekonomist", he said to his wife, "The harsh hazelnut."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenses in the fight against Merck for hepatitis C patent
The judge of the region has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. has the right to reimburse the costs of the lawyer's services paid by it in the case for the destruction of the Patent of Hepatitis C against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was justified in the case of a fine of 200 million pounds for the destruction of two Merck patents, which threatened it with regard to the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found infringements of Merk’s activities, such as melting after the oath has been transferred and other non-ethical activities.
In hearing the case on Thursday, U.S. regional judge Bet Labson Friman indicated that Gilead was entitled to claim compensation for the legal costs incurred in defending it in the present case.
Merck is trying to obtain market positions against Gilead, which is dominated by the market with new generations of hepatitis C medicines that are effective in 90% of liver disease cases.
The case was initiated already in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active ingredients of sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient of Gilead’s medicine.
The forces supported by the United States claim that they have fully taken over the control of Manbidge City from the Islamic State.
The forces supported by the United States have fully taken over the city of Manbidge in the northern part of the country at the Turkish border under their control and the last Islamic State troops have abandoned the city, the group's representative announced on Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are currently cleaning the city from the last opponent fighters who have not left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 hostages-civil people from the fighters, told Reuters to the news agency Sharfan Darwish from the SDS ally of the Manbidge Military Council.
"The city is currently under our full control and we are looking for fighters", he informed the agency Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton's income reached $10.75 million and a couple paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate.
The expiring Clinton Friday published the 2015 tax declaration, which shows that the candidate and her husband, the president of the Democratic Party, earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
During 2015, Clinton has donated 1 million dollars, mainly to his Clinton Charity Organisation. Former President Bil Clinton earned about 5.3 million dollars, speaking as a spider and having received 3 million dollars from his book on work in the State Department, published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton Election Union - Senator Tim Kein and his wife, U.S. Virginia State, have published their tax declaration for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20,3 %.
"Hilary Clinton and Tims Kein continue to establish new standards for financial transparency", said Jennifer Palmieri, partner of the Clinton campaign in her communication.
On the other hand, Donalds Tramps hides behind various reservations and reservations so that the promises to disclose their tax information should not be fulfilled.
Publication of tax information paid is a record of practice for the candidates of the US President, but it is not required by law.
The businessman of New York Tramps and his lawyers mention the audit of the State Revenue Service as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"Your move", in your Twitter record, Ians Sams, the partner of the Clinton campaign, was told about the tax information of the Democrat Party's candidate.
On Thursday, Trampa Special Advisor Michael Kohen told CNN that he would not allow Tramp to publish tax information before the audits were completed.
Trampa critics, including the candidate for the President of the Republican Party in 2012, Mitt Romny and other Republicans, claim that his refusal raises questions about his real property volumes, donations amounts and other business commitments, including commitments with Russia.
Clinton added oil to fire by publishing on Friday a video where several influential Republicans require Trampa to publish their tax information.
She returned to this issue again during the economic speech on Thursday in Michigan.
She said to the crowd: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for several decades."
“Politico” says that in 1990, two years Tramps has paid very little or no taxes, and the author of the business column of “New York Times” said that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an essential issue in these presidential elections.
Clinton, in support of the proposal by billions of Varena Bafeta, promotes the idea that everyone who earns more than 1 million dollars a year must pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Obama.
During the last week's presentation in Klinton, Omah, Nebraska, where his “Berkshire Hathaway” conglomerate is also located, Bafet called on Tramp to exchange tax returns.
Bafet said that he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps feared the voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information by 2007.
The Clintons are now living in Chapakovo, New York and have paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent for the period 2007 to 2014 and a total tax rate of about 40,5 per cent.
The 2015 Clinton Tax Review shows that unlike most Americans, only 100 dollars of their income are wages.
Their main investment was the low-cost index fund, from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticizes the hotel in Berlin for the unlocking of Israeli long-speaking code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The Greek French film director has built up a storm in the social media when it was discovered that there is no Israeli telephony code available at “Kempinski Bristol” hotel in Berlin.
Claude Lancman, director of documentary films about the holocaust "Shoah", did not conceal his dissatisfaction with the hotel in Berlin "Kempinski Bristol" and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During the recent visit, Lancman tried to find the telephone code for Israel in the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries that can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel has been wrapped and destroyed?
The article is Lancman.
Instead, the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel offers to call to this country through its call centre.
The director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer received "he was shocked."
The hotel administrator explained that "it was an informed decision of the hotel management".
The reason for the removal of the code was even more punched by film directors.
"The vast majority of the guests are Arabs and they asked for the Israeli code to be deleted," Lancman quotes the explanation of the hotel employee.
Suddeutsche Zeitung says that the Ambassador of Israel in Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsman, has called this case "a great shame".
We are surprised and shocked about this incident.
The same is a great shame.
And the fact that it is in Germany that it is in this hotel network is even more degraded.
Explanatory notes are not required.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will draw the right conclusions".
This event also gained quite a wide range of resonations on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski hotel has simply been arranged for Arab customers.
Another entry said "came" indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendamm on the street next to the synagogue.
Edition Der Spiegel says that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all the mistakes, declaring that it is all "a misunderstanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Ms Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes the representative of Kempinski.
And add that the code is added again to the list.
Police uses rubber balls and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The student and police collision took place on Thursday in the city of San Paulo, Brazil, where students gathered in demonstration against government education system reforms.
The police used rubber balls and tear gas against students.
The problems began when the law enforcement officers tried to extinguish the students, leading to the use of rubber balls and tear gas by the police.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to show their trouble with the reform of the education system.
Mr Geraldo Alckmina's proposal to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be moved to other schools to save money.
Some demonstrators drew on the walls graphics with messages against temporary President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of expressing their support to the deferred President, Dilma Rousefa, whose imprisonment was voted by the Senate.
Scott Kelums Skiner finishes the first to bring gold medals to the United Kingdom in the cycling
Kelums Skiners from Scottish finished the first men's cycling team at the races in the Rio Velodrome that took place last night. The British team guarded the title of his champion, which it acquired in the 2012 London games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glazgow played an important role in these competitions, making the legendary Scottish Ser Chris Hoy and putting the victory on favourite New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoey won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also reiterated this in the World Championship in London, although Huy had already finished his athlete career.
The problems were at the stage between Beijing and London’s Olympic Games because of the need to replace the experienced start specialist James Staf.
They did it at the last moment.
When Hoy left, he tried to fill Kyan Emady and Matt Crympton.
The British coachs were hoping for Scanner, seeing the potential that he later also showed.
Hindes, Kenny - championships that started four years ago with Hoy and Skiner, who set up an Olympic Qualification record, but the best start of the race was for the New Zealand team
However, British trio obtained gold medals.
Hindes were the close drivers in their circles, Kenny set up under the direction, and Skiner guarded this direction.
The change of the strategy played an important role in the victory, because Hindes were driven with a larger gear to allow Kenya and, in particular, Skineer to drive faster.
Hoey watched the race as a representative of the BBC and caught the eyes of Skiner, Kenny and Hindes when they went to the honorary pjedestra.
The 23-year-old glossary said, "It was an inexpensive honor."
I do everything to defend my name.
In conclusion, we set up an Olympic record and won the World Champions.
It was simply incredible.
There's no better victory.
After winning the 2012 Olympic Games in London with Kenya and Hoy, Hindes recognized that they deliberately fell on the track after a failure.
Later, he refused this comment and did not have the power for British competitors to prove the opposite.
This time there was no such incident.
Hindes said, "United flags in the tribunal brought London to memory."
Over the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many of the World Champions, so the victory in the Olympic Games was really special.
One medal will compete for a country that won seven of ten gold medals in the cycling of Beijing and London.
If this achievement is the result of the team's progress in the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya's outcome, he could really repeat the success of Hoya by obtaining three Olympic gold medals.
Kenya would mean six won gold and one silver medal. In addition, Kenny was born on March 23 (this looks like the British holy date, because Steve Regreiv, Mo Farah and Roger Banster were also born on that day).
On that date, Hoy was also born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old athlete from Bolton said: "Today I just enjoy it.
The team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win with the team members.
If honestly, then win one is a little lonely."
Hindes said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be put in the armor round."
On that day, it was the only fight for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Ser Bredley Vigin, Ed Clansy, Steve Burke, and Ovein Doul showed the fastest qualification time for four kilometres.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record, which was installed in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will certainly be at the centre of attention.
Yesterday before the qualification trip, he had disagreed with the commissioner when the judges called him to measure his height.
On a woman's journey that will continue and end today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Šanda, Elinora Barkere and Keitija Arčibalda, from Milngavia, installed a new record time of 4:13.260.
The British delegation hopes that the British wheelchair team, hopefully. will win medals in the middle stage of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the excellent and unprecedented performances in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio too.
Meanwhile, behind has gone different, after accusations of sex and respect, the technical director Shane Satons resigned, and the career is finished by Hoy and Victoria Bendletton.
However, starting with the first bike races, Britain seems to reach the highest level at the right time as always.
The future of the Portland cup becomes uncertain as an ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of aluminium cupboards and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, became uncertain, as its main client of energy company announced the termination of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the plans of the Government of Victoria to stop subsidising an energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year subsidies will be terminated in November.
Consequently, more than 2000 jobs in the Alcoa Portland are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be threatened.
In addition, it will also have unforeseen side effects, because the melthouse consumes about 10 percent of the total Victoria electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry cup, which led to the interruption of Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa Portland cup works with losses and can be closed.
These events have been caused by several years of speculation on the increase in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the plant.
The power supplier of the plant AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroubes Iele, says that the remaining three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plants belong to the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the parts of the company, are owned by Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp holding companies.
AGL looks forward to the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean a further supply of energy to the factory," said its representative.
AGL stated that the contracts were so-called "risk-limiting contracts", which were expected to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts are valid for a period of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also during the 2017 fiscal year," said the company representative.
From the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL argues that its forecasts have already accounted for losses of USD 187 million , providing that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa notes that the decision to terminate contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue or supply energy.
The U.S. company states that it has concluded a contract with Loy Yang in 2010 for 20 years, but it will be interrupted in November. The company does not provide explanations on why it will interrupt cooperation.
Analytics have expressed concern about the possible closure of the Portland cup in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the industry.
AGL Executive Director Steven Mikelon said last week that, according to analyst estimates, Portland uses 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy during the year.
If both plants leave the energy market, then energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160 000 people are rejected, and the situation may deteriorate as the budget falls.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mainly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to combat illegal extinction - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been congested, warns that the situation will only become worse as funding falls.
As of June of the following year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than it has been.
James Farels, Director of the Legal Centre of Queenland, said that the latest Report of the National Legal Centres Association states that the legal aid is now refused by thousands of people who need it.
Mistress Farel pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only become worse.
He also says: 'The legal centre of Queenland is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that thousands of people who need it are denied.'
People who are trying to put an end to violent relations, people with deep debt, families experiencing divorce, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have legal problems and this report shows that they do not receive the necessary assistance.
From June 2017, the Federal Government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, which means that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to deal with their difficult legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Prosecutor General and the Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately suspend the reduction of funding so that people in need of legal aid can obtain it.
Last year, the government revealed its plans to raise the level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to draw attention to the needs of local communities and their customers and to the Palazčuka government to invest in this important area.
Donalda Trampa campaign is challenged in court because one of the employees has pulled the fireplace
New York: Donalda Trampa campaign organisers have been accused of the court because they have not acted on the information that its Head of North Carolina operations will turn the fireplace against a staff member when they have driven in one car in February.
This incident was described in a court order submitted by Vincent Bordini to the Sharlot court on Wednesday, an former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had waited for months to start the internal investigation of this case, but he realized that it would not happen.
Driver Michael Philip "written the gun, put his good indicator finger on the guilloche and opened the roof against the Wincent's road", Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same experience.
"The armies do not need to shoot to cause damage," says Bordini in his complaint.
Only two days before the submission of this case, the candidate of the Republican Party for President was triggered by a scandal declaring to the people that "The people of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners of arms and enthusiasts, could act in the event of his wish to win his lateral cense Hilarija Clinton and his elected judges.
The representatives of the Trampa campaign announced that the media had expelled his words from the context, and he had never given anyone to violence.
By its request, the Bordini wants to recover compensation from the organisers of the campaign for the negligence of supervision, and from Philips for the attack, illegal use of the rock and the creation of emotional stress.
Mr Trampa's representative Houpa Hixa did not make any comments immediately.
Not able to contact Philips.
The WCCB - Charlotte local news agency says that Philip has recently abandoned the campaign.
Likewise, his consultancy firm "Innovative Consultation Services" has not been able to call.
The candidate for the President of the Republican Party Donalds Tramps has implemented a controversial election campaign.

New tradition - the municipality and sports festival in Kūļciema.
On Saturday, in Kūļciem, the people gathered for the first time on the parish and sports celebrations.
After ten years of celebration, this time it was decided that the Lakes Festival would be no longer.
A new page has now been divided.
The day started with sports competitions.
This time the race was not traditional and too serious because, for example, the shooters had to throw in the sleeping target, the boot fled, the left-hand throw, the balling has not been in any Olympic game at all.
However, each member could show how strong, courageous, fruitful and resilient he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered in the open-air estrade, where the city celebration began.
In the meantime, there was also a "child corner", where young people could get out of inflatable attractions and get a new image in the face groove.
A novelty that could also become a tradition was a parade of tractors and motorcycles.
Inga Kadik-Skadiņa, the head of Ķūļciema district administration, who wanted a nice rest and dry time, talked to all of them, but it did not disturb anything much.
The festival continued with the welcome of the youngest people of Kūļciema.
It is really good that the municipality has supplemented five girls and one boy.
Amateur art collectives from the region of Engure had arrived at the junipers - the audience was very pleased with the performances of the oldest dance set "Ruden rhythms", the various people dance performers "Redas" and young dancers "Zelta peale".
And it's nothing that wetly on the stage somebody also slipped.
Of course, local people and villages were delighted by the famous actor's duet Jānis Jarans and Dainis Porgants, who were once again Mildiņš Nabiņš and Skaidrīte Kraniņa, as well as Berzciema's attractive wives from the fisherman's "Daily".
The ball was played by the group "Brussels".
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and extend Hitrova.
Hitrov will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also in the country as a whole.
This, in my opinion, makes Hitrov very attractive, as in 2012, in London, where we invested a huge amount of work so that all regions of the country could benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford and Īstenda got a lot from the Olympic Games.
And we will do this again, providing local citizens and businesses with business opportunities near Hitrov.
For local communities alone, we will create 10 000 new business opportunities, 40 000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Hitrov region.
As in the London Olympic Games in 2012, there will be people this time who will believe that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hitrov is too ambitious.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympic Games and that it would be a global failure.
Sceptics were mistaken for 2012, and in the case of Hitrov, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Hitrov has so far overcome everything.
As in the Olympic Games, Hitrov is an infrastructure project that benefits society as a whole, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs, with an economic growth of 211 billion, creating a soil for both employment and experience at this airport and for the whole of Great Britain.
In Hitrov, there is a great team, which has created an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion pounds, including in time and budget from terminal 5, which has been named as the best airport terminal in the world for five years, and terminal 2, which is built between the more intensive runways in the world.
They are now ready to create a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were an excellent success, and I am sure that this will also be the enlargement of Hitrov.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and extend Hitrov, ensuring the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain could be proud.
Lord Paul Daton is a member of the Hytrou Board and former Secretary of Commercial Affairs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman flew on the highway, trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, it's on the highway.
The police tried to find witnesses for an accident, when she traveled several cars early in the morning on the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the city of Morges in Vo Canton.
Vo Canton Police Report says that when she desperately wanted to commit suicide, she had learned on the road in darkness where she traveled several cars.
In an unambiguous attempt to kill himself, the victims, the 49 - year - old Swiss, traveled several cars, including a heavy car.
She died at the event.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already witnessed, but others have not yet been identified, says the police, who invites the drivers and witnesses involved.
The case also opened a criminal investigation, which in that case is a logical step, to the Le Tribune de Geneve issue by lawyer Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofsteller adds: "The prosecutor will explain this."
Two similar cases that have occurred over the last 5 years show that none of the drivers will be held liable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone to the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect a highway pedestrian to be in the middle of the night, a newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was righted to be killed out of attention in August 2014, when she traveled to a man who was in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijerne.
The Court found that the 22 - year - old victim was drunk and later noticed sleeping on the road.
The Court concluded that the policeman, who was on the road to the accident, traveled in an appropriate way and the judge acknowledged that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unpredictable and exceptional case".
Anyone who has information about the accident that occurred on Thursday near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Signatures for a new VID manager’s post shall be collected on the Internet.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" launched the collection of signatures for the competition of a new Head of State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Green and Farmers' Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional appointment process.
The petition was founded on August 10, and it is currently signed by 55 people.
The appointment process of the applicant for the Director-General for the VID is opaque and non-professional.
It recalls the best functional traditions of the Soviet Union.
It discredits public administration and makes society disappointment in government and politics for the next time.
"The competition with clear criteria for which all candidates are to be assessed is necessary", the petition text states.
Its author, Jānis B., indicated that the public is not aware of the criteria for the appointment of Collegovo.
Nor is it clear what candidates intend to do in the work of the VID.
The study states that the Registry should establish a new open competition, which actively addresses professional candidates, attracts staff selection experts and offers an appropriate remuneration.
Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola formally appointed the Head of the Colegovi VID last week, which was intended to approve him in the government this week in the new post, but all the ministers of the 'Unity' party voted against, so the question was postponed for a week.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played bad.
Pludmal volleyballists Alexander Samoilov and John Schēdin have hoped for the prize in the Olympic Games of Rio de Janeiro, but without it, there is no difference in place to conclude the competition, after leaving the tournament expressed Samoilov.
One of the world's strongest beach volleyball pairs lost Evandrs Gonsalvešs Oliveirs and Pedro Solbergs Salgadas in the closing and decisive game with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) by concluding their participation in the four-year most important sports forum.
In three subgroups Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same ratio was for two more couples.
The ratio of three small points between pairs was further calculated, which was the most unfavourable of Latvia's duet after the persuasive loss suffered in this line.
"In the first set we were guided, but from 16:15 we also remained to 16 points," the course of the game was remembered by Šēdiņš.
I don't even know how we stayed in the rest of the set.
It must not be played.
After that, everything in the second set was fine and the set at the end managed to break the game, and it should also be a good foundation for the third set.
We started it similarly, but after we changed the sides, the result grew for only one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so the small points were important.
"We should have played more similarly than repeatedly return 3-4 points in a row," said the athlete.
We knew that Evandra could be reserved.
"In the first set we met with it, in the second inlaid 1-2 points, and in the third +4 he left the game," recalled Šēdiņš.
We tried to show the best game.
The times came, the times didn't.
I did not look at the situation of the overall assessment before the match, but it was known that there was a need for as many small points as possible.
"If we lost, so I played bad," said Samoilov.
We waited for a good service from Evandra, and in its first set, we also met quite well, but in the third, we opened up the service and made it difficult to form an attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistakes in my admission to the service of Peter, but it had to be done.
Samoilov said that, contrary to the previous match, athletes today had no nervousness.
"We went, played, protection was, however, needed a better service," said the athlete.
"They played well, and at the end they came to the "curra".
Before the tournament, we said that the lottery was the most uncomfortable one.
We also had the prospect of fighting for the first place, but we did not even get out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for the medal and also for us, but then there is no difference - 25th or 4th," said Samoilovs, who predicted that the duet would continue to play together in the future.
I think the question will not be and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samoilov Rio de Janeiro was already in the third Olympic Games career because in 2008 he started with Martiņš Pieviņš, but four years ago he played with Ruslan Sorocin.
Meanwhile, Shadddy had the second start in the Olympics.
Latvenergo is followed by the process of opening the gas market from the position of the potential trader.
The State Energy Company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from both the consumer's position and the position of the potential merchant, said the company's press secretary, Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether or not in the future Latvenergo will join the gas market as a trader will determine what the model of the gas market and the legal framework will be established."
"For this reason, we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation and we are presenting our proposals", said Bidere.
The Agency BNS already wrote that the Ministry of Economics (EM) in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the Energy Company "Latvian Gas" developed draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers "The Rules for Trade and Use of Natural Gas", which will change the existing principles of the functioning of the natural gas market, providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose the natural gas trader from 3 April 2017.
The aim of EM in its new natural gas market regulation is to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service option, the "central model of the dealer" is chosen, where all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one invoice and one place of provision of information and customer service, leaving the distribution system operator technical issues.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in electricity trading.
We recall that the gradual opening of the market for household users - even after 3 April 2017, those household users who will not want to choose another natural gas dealer will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader", informed the Ministry.
Conversely, operators will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom a natural gas trade agreement is to be concluded.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, trade in natural gas for a certain period of time will be provided by the existing natural gas trader at a fixed price.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers address in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to and the end of supply to users, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the rights and obligations of the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the owner of the gas-fired facility; the arrangements for settlement of the services received, the amount of interest on the delay, the modalities for exchange of traders and the supply of natural gas to the users in the event of disruption; the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to the related users by the public trader.

Minister: next week it is planned to decide on increasing the remuneration of the Director-General for the VID.
Minister for Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Green and Farmers Union (ZZS)) plans next week to speak with Prime Minister Māri Kučinski (ZZS) and government coalition partners about increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of the State Revenue Service (VID).
On Friday, the President-Ozole pointed out to journalists that the question of increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of the VID should be addressed urgently in order to make this post more attractive to potential tenderers for re-succession.
The next week also talked about changing the conditions of the tender.
The Minister also stressed that she had no idea of a specific candidate to address the vacant position.
At the same time, Reisniece-Ozola expressed the view that Inga Kolegova, the Head of the State Environmental Service, would have been a good director-general of the SDG.
On the other hand, with regard to the current MDG leader, Daci Pelik, who has expressed its readiness to qualify for this post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new MDG Director-General should be "sight from the edge" and should not come from the MDG structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for the return of the Saeima from leave to direct the amendments to the legislation necessary for the reorganisation of the SDG as soon as possible.
The Agency has already stated that the Head of the State Environmental Service, Inga Kolegova, presented an application to Danai Reisniece-Ozola (ZZS), to refer to the post of Director-General for the SDG.
In her application she stated that it was not easy to choose, but in the last two weeks her relatives had experienced serious emotional pressure, although they had not done any act of law condemnable.
Colegovo also pointed out that her candidacy discussion has increased contradiction between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that Mr Inara Petersone, Director-General of the previous VID, left office at the end of June.
Oil prices continue to climb; stock exchange indexes in the USA and Europe, as well as US dollar value.
World oil prices continue to increase on Friday morning, with the positive impact of investors' moods on the Saudi Arabian Minister for Oil, which reinforces the expectations that the largest oil-benefiting countries will take action to stabilise the world oil market at the forthcoming OPEC meeting in September.
The three main US stock exchange indexes reached a record high level that has not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the oil price rise and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several companies in Thursday also led to the increase in European stock exchanges.
The value of the US dollar increased on Thursday in relation to the euro, in relation to the British pound and in relation to Japanese yen.
New York Stock Exchange price for deliveries of WTI brand crude oil increased on Thursday by $1.78 to $43.49 per barrel.
The price of Brent crude oil for deliveries on the London stock exchange increased by $1.99 - to $46.04 per barrel in October.
The turnover of the Conservative manufacturer "Blue lagoon" is declining by 33.8% last year.
The turnover of the Conservatives manufacturer "Blue Lagoon" last year was EUR 4.202 million, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses decreased by 5.7 times - to 904.7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The company's management report states that in 2015 the company worked with losses caused by several reasons, including the permanent lack of turnover due to the exit of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by stopping the existing credit line and leaving the Blue Lagogue with contracts concluded without being able to execute them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient means to buy cheaper raw materials in large volumes and obtain a volume discount.
The exit of the bank concerned from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing the structural support projects of the European Union which would have allowed the production plant to purchase new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Similarly, the financial creators of the company were negatively affected by the increase in raw material prices and by the customer’s unwillingness to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only in the second half of July 2016, customers recognized price changes and were prepared to buy goods at the new - highest - prices", says the company's management.
In 2015 "Blue lagoon" also started discussions with potential investors, including the valuation of company's movable and immovable property.
Investors have already been at the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have familiarized and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the implementation of the restructuring and optimisation plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimisation of technological processes, which enables higher production productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"Several equipment that ensures a higher speed of production have only been purchased", indicated the company's management.
The management of "Zilo lagūna" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's factory to execute orders that were not possible so far.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
As intentional protocols on the sales of the product have already been signed, all production will be sold according to the intentional protocols.
The new product increases its turnover by around 300 thousand euros per month", says the company's management.
Also, in August 2016, the company plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish production to Iraq.
"Blue Margin" has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, expanded the market to Cyprus and signed this September a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the United States.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Blue lagoon" worked with a turnover of €6.347 million and a loss of €5.113 million.
The Blue Marina was founded in 1997 and its share capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company belongs to two Latvian individuals – Mikhail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor Schirshon (10.89%).
Welcome to plan 15 at the museum to wait for the film show Zar Leander and to participate in the press conference.
Riga can be seen as a city of beginning and inspiration of the dedicated film dives of Sarah Leander's career.
The visit of Zāras Lenderes to the cross-committee Ruta, who was a Swedish Ambassador in Latvia, appeared in Riga in 1924, because it was she that revealed the unusual low controversy of Zāras Leanderes to her woman, which she tried to debit to the stage of the theatre in Riga.
Perhaps the accidental feeling in Riga became a fate turn in the creative way of Sarah toward the world's praise.
Riga Zar Leander was associated with warm memories, and she was hoping to visit Riga in guest exhibitions, but unfortunately, these expectations were not decided to be fulfilled because the Second World War began.
Using the show form, this meeting will be possible at Riga Festival 2016 and the great Ieva Kerevica will feel in the role of the outstanding Sara Leander.

The insurer shall pay compensation to passengers on Wednesday of the flight cancelled at the airport.
If the insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family for Wednesday, on August 10, the cancellation of the airline at Riga Airport, which led to the refusal of the planned visit to the music festival.
11 August If an application for remuneration was received from a client in insurance.
The family had planned to go to the music festival in Belgium, but since this was not possible on Wednesday, the customer was compensated for the booking of accommodations that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the tickets of EUR 204 purchased at the airport.
On the other hand, the customers have promised to reimburse the airline for the flight tickets.
If, on average, 15% of all travel insurance benefits have paid compensation for the termination or cancellation of the journey.
"These times the expenses for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of the accommodation are reimbursed", says Dagnija Rutka, the head of the insurance product for the risk of persons.
As we know, the technical problems of the runway at Riga Airport on the evening of 10 August were caused by a private aircraft, so only several departing flights were cancelled and several incoming flights had to be channelled to other airports.
Because of the repair of the neighborhood, the man is crushed at the ceilings and forced to leave the house.
Dmitris Saidjaševs, whose neighbor started to make capital repairs in his apartment, turned to LTV 4.Study, and since then Dmitris has been deprived of ceilings and is not sure to stay in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbours carried out arbitrary construction and that the ceilings in my apartment have been damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Construction Board, the House Manager and other organizations.
The Construction Board said that we are not any operational service and we have no expert.
"The owner of the gym must go to the Latvian Inspectors' Union, and there will be an expert from there", says Dmitris.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what was happening, and recognized that the cover was in an unsatisfactory position.
However, a month has passed since the first Dmitri's application in the building council, and by the beginning of this week no one could answer whether the location in the apartment was life-threatening.
The construction board said that this is legislation, wait if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then wrote to the Riga Council, but they sent the house to the manager, then the house manager again to the construction government, and then there is a clash," says Dmitris.
After examining the entire paper cup, it is clear that the construction work has been stopped, even though you can hear that someone works there.
The owner of the apartment carrying out repairs must carry out an examination within two months and all these defects must be eliminated within six months.
The independent expert has developed his opinion, but the construction board considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether or not the metal structure contained in this carrier structure has been affected, and therefore there is no assurance that the owner of the lower apartment is exposed to the risk.
"However, we have requested an additional explanation from this expert", says Ilze Žūka, representative of the Riga City Construction Board.
Despite the ban on any repairs in the upper apartment, construction continues from there.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a construction permit is between EUR 70 and EUR 700, but in the case in question the penalty may be much stricter.
As long as the expert's opinion is expected, the construction board decided that both apartments should not be operated - both where construction works are carried out and Dmitri apartment.
"This is not a case in the practice of the construction government where, as a result of its lack of knowledge or simply the unwillingness, the citizens may have caused a threat not only to their own property but also to the owner of the subordinate property, as a result that the owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the construction council.
Now Dmitris has been deferred to search for a different place to live - to his relatives, friends, hotel or to rent another apartment.
But Dmitri can try to recover from a neighbor in civil law, which can take a lot of time.
Because of arbitrary construction, it is prohibited to stay in both apartments at the moment until the engineer gives his conclusion, and it may have to be expected for up to three weeks.
Losses incurred will be borne by the owner of the apartment in which repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened by a prison sentence for up to six months because the government has not taken into account what it says.
Think about it!

The conversion of the former Ķemeru sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost EUR 22 million.
The conversion of the former Ķemeru sanatorium into the five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" will cost EUR 22 million, the LETA is told by the representative of the future hotel manager SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri".
The establishment of the hotel is the first phase of the renovation of the former Ķemeri sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or well-being clinic, which is planned to be opened in 2022, while the hotel will be opened in May 2018.
Želve notes that the cost of accurate clinics is not yet known.
But she points out that it will be located in a former Ķemeri resort’s clinic building of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be placed on three floors.
"Park Hotel Ķemeri" and the prospective clinic are the owner of the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
G Capital Europe's owners are several investors investing in this fund, according to Želve.
As George Joun, Executive Director of G Capital Europe said earlier, it is planned to invest between 12 and 15 million euros in the development of the former resort’s clinic, with a total investment amount exceeding 30 million euros.

As reported, the historical sanatorium complex Ķemeri plans to create a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and "wellness" or a well-being clinic.
However, reconstruction is prolonged.
On the other hand, the 2010 annual report stated that Ominasis was regularly communicating with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to ensure day-to-day technical control of the sanatorium "Kemeri", and that already in 2011, it was definitely "complete the reconstruction of the future hotel "Kemeri" and immediately started preparations for opening the "Kempinski" chain hotel.
In October 2014, his readiness to acquire the rescuing stock of Ķemeri owned by the insolvent "Ominasis Latvia" was confirmed by "Park Hotel Ķemeri" in the auction, but a month later the auction was recognised as unsuccessful because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the prescribed time.
The sale price was set at the start price of the last unsuccessful auction of EUR 2.86 million.
As a representative of the City Council Ieva Aile informed the LETA agency, the municipality, signing the protocol, confirmed that the European Union’s support for the co-financing of the Structural Funds will arrange an upcoming infrastructure – will restore the historical Ķemeru park, create an interactive natural tourism facility, arrange roads and parking places.

Former NATO Commander Bridlov's e-mail hacked Russian hackers.
Hakers, who broke the computers of the National Committee of US Democrats (DNC), may have carried out several other cyber attacks, also broke up by the e-mail of the former NATO European Force Commander Philip Bridlov and the servers of the George Soros Institute "Open Society", the business news agency "Bloomberg".
The Hakers published the information on DDCLeaks.com.
Among other things, the Bridlovs correspondence and information on the work of the Soros Institute are included.
For hackers the Institute's computers were available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same Russian spearheaded hackers who broke DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal, in turn, reports that the U.S. President Baraka Obama's administration is currently dealing with the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the launch of DNC computers.
In order to introduce sanctions, the administration will have to make an official cyber attack against the servers of the Democratic Party against Russia or hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
As reported, the WikiLeaks website published in July around 20 000 emails from the DNC computer system, from which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the campaign of Vermont Senator of the party's ex-Clinton competition in the fight against the beginning of the presidential election of the democratic nomination.
According to the US press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts the investigation of the use of democrats servers, as well as other US secretaries, believes that Russia's relationship with the cyber attack is undoubtedly questionable.
Makartny: Joko Ono's presence threatened the Beatles.
Paul Makartnis acknowledged that Joko Ono's presence created the feeling of danger of the legendary group The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of Jonas Lenona, but at the time she went to the group while visiting the record studio, Makartnia was afraid because Ono was the only woman among the group members - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenon and Makartnia.
When he asked about both relationships, he answered the magazine "Rolling Stone": "It's really good."
We felt at that time at risk.
While we wrote, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most groups could not tolerate this.
We were able to do this, but not quite successful because we were very tense.
We were not sexists, but the girls usually did not come to the record study, they allowed us to work.
When John began to meet Joko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of our four.
The author of "Yellow Submarine" has also acknowledged that he is now regularly contacting the former member of the group Ringo and regularly confirms the work plans of the record studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" has "complete".
The question was whether he still meets with the other one still living in the legendary hand group, Makartny's magazine "Rolling Stone" said, "Frequently no."
We meet in social events and parties.
But I do not go to meetings, but I feel slightly separated from it.
I went from Apple during a heavy divorce.
I sent John Trutman to the meetings in my place and said, "Come to me what everyone says, because I can't suffer sitting at that table."
It was too painful as if we could see our pet dying.
The company now works so that I only listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venice has ever been inhabited on the planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has ever been an inhabited planet.
Researchers from NASA Godarda Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore the history of Venus through the tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venice, whose surface is hot, with no water and which is almost carbon-based atmospherics, had ever had earthlike conditions.
Scientists have already said that the slow speed of Venice is due to the dense atmosphere.
However, the latest simulations show that Venus has ever had a plan, earthlike atmosphere and slowly turned into it.
The model also looks at Venice's former topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on the Earth, but there were enough water and geographical diversity to make life and prevent water evaporation.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was more bright than 30 percent.
In the simulation of the GISS, the Venus rotation model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts 2 months, explains in the press release of GISS scientist Antonio Del Genio.
This process warms the surface of the planet and causes rain, which in turn forms a thick cloud layer that acts as a rainguard, protecting the planet from sun heat.
This leads to a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model reflects Venus history, similar to the evolution theory developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although ever inhabited, Venus has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation over several billion years.
Its oceans were tanned, and the spirits were tanned by ultraviolet rays.
When the water was completely emulsified, there was only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse gas - Venus, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venice climate model in the magazine “Geophysical Research Letters”.
Patrick Roy resigns from the Avalanche coach's position
On Thursday, the coach of Colorado "Avalanche" and Vice-President of Hokey's operations Patriks Rojs made an appeal as a reason to mention the insufficient impact of the team's decision-making process.
Vice-President of Colorado and President-General Joe Sakik approved this message and informed that the club would immediately start searching for a new coach.
"In the last three years, I have been vigorous, passionate and targeted as the main coach and the Vice President of Colorado Club's Hokey Operations," said the 50-year-old Paradise.
During this summer, I've been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team's performance to give it the necessary glory and achieve a higher level of results.
In order to achieve this, the visions of the main coach and the vice-president of the hockey operations must be fully agreed with the organization's visions.
He must also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions are not met.
Says who hired Paradise on 23 May 2013, thanked Rojam for his contribution to the team.
Says he said Patrick was informed of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the best coach in the League and received Jack Adams prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Divisia, but in the first round of the exclusion games the team of Colorado won the Minesoto hokeisti. Since then, the club has not entered the exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche closed the 2015-2016 season with the result 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team without obtaining the second special invitation from the organisers of the Western Conference.
Slava Hall Guard Roy won four Stanley cups in his career - two with Monreal "Canadiens" and two with "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and postpone strike
The employees' strikes on the remuneration of North Sea oil platform workers have been carried out because both parties have resumed the negotiations, tell the negotiating leaders.
Wood Group is periodically organizing strikes on North Sea oil platforms with Royal Dutch Shell.
The Joint Communication states that the Wood Group and Unite and RTT trade unions agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled over the coming weeks, which will start at the beginning of the next week with a view to re-examineing problem issues.
Trade unions stated that their recent events, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were directed against a planned reduction of 30% of wages.
Due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced wages for the North Sea workers by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that the reductions in additional wages would allow the company to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has already reduced wages for several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas activities in 10 countries to optimise its work in preparing for a large-scale merger with the British energy company "BG Group".
Energy companies are under pressure due to the fall in oil prices, and the situation is more difficult for the British decision to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, Member of the Scottish Parliament Dave Anderson met with representatives of workers to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea Strategy Plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
He explained in his report that the North Sea and the country as a whole needed an economy that would benefit all, not individual individuals.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion compared to $7 billion invested in the last five years.
Kepler is the size of the stars turning speed in the Pleadade constellation.
The newest Keplera Telescope mission has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of star rotation at the Plaice Constellation.
The new data helps the astronomers to understand why the stars turn at different speeds in this constellation, as well as how the speed of the stars is to be attributed to the formation of planets.
"We hope that when comparing our results with other stars, we will receive more information about the relationship between the mass of the stars, age and even the history of its solar system," Luis Rebula, the analyst of Pasaden Caltech Infrasarkano Process and the analyst of the Centre, announced in the news release.
The plane constellation is located 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this constellation only begin to grow, reaching about 125 million years of age.
They turn at maximum speed.
These growing stars emit a large amount of star winds at peak speeds.
When winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they stop the stars.
As the stars age, their turning rate is decreasing.
The Kepler shall measure the rate of rotation of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognisable star area such as the sun spot.
The latest star speed catalogue shows that larger stars turn slower than smaller stars.
Rebule compares stars with dancers, bigger height dancers perform piruettes slower than small height dancers.
Rebuls tells us that the "Ballet" of the Pleadade shows that slowly rotating objects are larger and massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Pleadade's constellation is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where the characteristics of the stars can be compared with the speeds of turning.
Rebulas tells us that the Pleadade constellation helps to create theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn how, when and why the speed of stars turning down and the process of stopping them completely is slow.
Rebul and his colleagues presented a detailed analysis of the speeds of the flood stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
