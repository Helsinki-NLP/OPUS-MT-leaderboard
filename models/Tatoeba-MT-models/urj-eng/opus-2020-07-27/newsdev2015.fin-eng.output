In addition to EU company aid, the management of national company aid will be concentrated on four housing centres from mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, South Savo is responsible for operations in Mikkeli, the South Savo ey centre.
According to the new company aid law, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Fund assistance must no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is entirely new.
The subsidiaries of municipalities of more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be great honours.
Instead, EU aid can continue to be granted for investment in improving local economic conditions.
In Eastern Finland, about 30 people will be able to strengthen the EU and national aid management unit.
At least for the time being, they all continue to work at their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölösen, Head of the Structural Funds Unit of the South Savo Ely Centre, is working in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is Russia now seeking to pursue Ukraine.
Russia works consistently, even though it doesn't always seem like it.
Head of the National Defence College Strategy Department, Colonel Lecturer, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised by the conflicting Ukrainian news of Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more from here).
On the other hand, Ukraine is telling us that its paratroopers are currently fighting with the Russian tank division near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank division has received confirmations (read more from here).
Lavrov insisted that a immediate ceasefire should be achieved in the talks of Minsk without conditions.
Russia denies being involved and must immediately be able to reach the outcome of the negotiations so that they can gain their settled status in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole plan, siren says.
This is the big pattern: we must quickly start negotiating and precisely so that Russia can take its own grip on Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair externalises passenger services for the Norwegian company, rents people.
Finnair is starting to buy passenger services as subcontracted from OSM Aviation from a Norwegian crewing company.
The agreement first concerns the routes between Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore, but it is intended to be extended later.
In Finland, the appearance of two routes leads to a reduction in the total of about a hundred working years, which is carried out in the first stage by bookings, the company reported in its information.
In addition, about 80 Asian temporary workers will be out of work at the time when routes are outside.
Finnair already told us in June that it is going to take out about 20 routes of passenger services over the next two years.
The missions were concluded when the staff were not able to reach agreement on savings.
The exhibitions are intended to start next year in January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will also continue with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems increase the risk of nerve back pain, i.e. shock pain, for those who work hard to work.
In the field of occupational health care, firemen were monitored for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disorders to the impact of the attack on the tree is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and sustainability of firemen, which are tested regularly, does not seem to protect you against pain, reports the research director, Docent Sirpa Luisa, in the information provided by the occupational health care service.
The work of the firemen is an irregular work in which shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the unexpected new reasons for water damage?
They easily cause damage to other dwellings easily cause damage to damage to other dwellings and other dwellings easily cause damage to the damage easily to damage to other dwellings.
Water damage Water damage does not always result from leaking pipe or tap, reminds me of the expert in the Hostship Association.
We have been contacted by the fact that the infringement of the quartz has caused water damage in the building, as to whether it is possible to ban aquariums, reports the legal expert of the Hostship Association Marina Furuhjem.
It is recalled that only pipes and sinks are not common causes of water damage, but also more and more new machinery, such as ice-colding machines, have caused water leaks in housings.
Many do not know that machines such as washing machines or washing machines should not be left uncontrollable.
Water is also to be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, because otherwise the pressure in the pipe can lead to water leaking.
A resident may be considered to have committed negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case liability for damages is a resident.
Of course, in such cases home insurance may compensate for damage, depending on the conditions and the case of the insurance.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused carelessness in the event of damage, the citizen shall be liable for compensation.
If the resident has gone into the shower on the floor well, failure can often be proved because in these cases the water has been flooded elsewhere and the care provider comes into the apartment where the lost resident is found.
The record shows that due to the increase in the impact on the floor mines, many student housings now have two floor mines installed in the showers.
Water damage has also been caused by waterbeds, although not to the extent that they were more popular than before.
Even the dog's water cup and the fall of the home wine can become real water damage.
I also know a case where there were many cats in the apartment that had been peeing on the floors so that there was widespread damage, Furuhjem tells me.
The principle of liability always goes in the same way unless otherwise specified in the company’s statutes.
The share is responsible for repair of the surface material and damage to the building structure and damage to other dwellings.
Water damage can easily cause damage to other apartments, because concrete in the structure is really easy to suck on water.
According to the loads, battery leaks in housings are particularly difficult because batteries are easily leaked into secret structures.
Water damage can now cause increased air heat pumps that produce condenser water.
Water should lead to a solid drain or a rainwater network, not just a container.
It is also the responsibility of the Participant to remove water, snow, ice and waste from the balcony, and to advise the lawyer.
The box provides that although the rules of the holding do not require, for example, fixed removals of washing machines, insurance may be subject to the condition for which compensation is not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policies.
However, I find the unladen, for example, of washing machines, as a major risk of water removal pipes in the tub, which have resulted in many damage.
I recommend that those removals be kept permanently connected to the sewerage pipeline.
The removal of snow and water by a balcony with a balcony with snow and water.
Control of washing machines, washing machines, etc., with them on top of it.
Closure of water (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor well is visible on a part twice a year in half a year.
The recommendation is to switch off your removals firmly to the drain.
Check the gloves and their possible leaks.
Regular freezer digestion at regular freeze digestion.
Do you have any experience of water damage?

F F F F Konka disappeared again, and cast into a comic as a serial ju b b C F F F C C C C C Hon lost again, and cast into a comic as a serial jujujujujujujujuju as a comic into a jujujuju
On Sunday night, two of the weakest teams met in Tapiola Sports Park with the fitness team at this moment.
In June, the FC Honka, who celebrated the final victory, hosted seven games in a winning tube from Vaasa Ball Society.
VPS has just received Honka in July.
Sunday's encounter with the espoolas team came to a good sauna, for VPS returned for a long time to its profit margin by reading 2-1.
Commissioner Olli Huttunen complained before the game about the inefficiency of his team, but the confused Honka defense facilitated VPS goalmaking problems.
It's just that it's a very nervous performance.
We didn't get any more attacks at all, we didn't get to hold the ball," Hutune estimates his own performance.
In the first half of Honga's top-thirty, Milos Milos Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played really uncertainly.
Both Vassian paints were born as a result of loose play of the cuppers.
Only five minutes after Steven Morrissey directed Sebastian Strandvall's launch, the opening land of the game was seen by Honka painter Walter Viita.
I'm sorry for the first half.
By field time the team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game", Honga’s head coach Shefki Kuqi was on his man.
After the start of the attack, the espoolans were able to collect their game and turn the ball around at the head of the attack.
Especially in the middle field, Carlos Portela and the tailor Roni Porokara were eager to apply for places of work, but the final solutions were almost repeatedly sour.
The closest goal was Honga's mid-field man, Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres was, however, a little past VPS painting.
VPS effectively attacked using his quick attackers and Honga's confusing cupboarder.
At about half an hour, the Vasas made 2-0 osuma when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got in two blocks between themselves.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was on a good end during the opening season and created repeated situations from the left.
Stewart's speed again seemed to be too much for espoolal defence throughout the game.
"I woke up in half that if they were lost, then we'd lose with honor," Kuqi told me.
Deficient Honka applied for the second period with fiercely enchanting paint.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third attempt succeeded.
Contributor Yerai Vilaboa finished the goal in the middle of the penalty zone.
After the Vilaboa goal, Honga had a half-hour time to pay off the match.
The Espoo team has been taking more and more risks, giving VPS the opportunity to face dangerous counter-attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey reached the brightest time with the Cute, but the frantic attacks of the Honka painter kept the home team involved in the game.
The rest of the line Honka was a little tired, and he didn't get any extra standards before.
With the ticket, Honka was the last one to swear the Veikkauschiang when there are still seven matches left in the show.
magazine: Putin was threatened by being able to conquer Kiev in two weeks a week or two a week.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was rather busy in his telephone discussion with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian La Repubblica magazine.
It expressed its irritability at the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica will tell Putin said so.
According to the newspaper Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth annoying Russia with new sanctions.
Putin gave the Russian television first channel an interview about the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
Putin told the interview that he was keeping the conflict fully within Ukraine and urged the Government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time he warned Kiev about the fire of civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "Can't watch next door" if people are shot to death from close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine admits: The actor's work destroyed the family family family destroyed the family.
the hard work of the Conquest and the theatre family grew to recognize how the actor’s profession destroyed his first marriage.
An actor Esko Roine will be over 70 years next Friday, but I think she's qualified to say that age is just a number.
I don't notice any difference between the year before or two years or ten years ago.
The mental puberty appears to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine's been retired for years, but still she's pressurized for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was a joke that this country would not do many plays without Esko Roinetta.
Currently, Roine has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre play How to make progress in business life, at the Tampere Employment Theatre's Mental Reconciliator and at the Kvartet of the Tampere Komedia Theatre.
Roine will also be seen in the future Risto Rupper movie.
KAU: Reijo Hietanen
Rogaine's actress career didn't start out promisingly.
I didn't fit in with a teaboy picture in high school.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't lose weight.
The choice was clear, there was no choice.
It seemed close and beloved to me.
I was so busy in the field that I left school together, and as a volunteer, I went to the army just to get to the theater school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done some 200 theatre roles and 300 TV shows a little depending on how calculated.
If the works are calculated like the Engelsmanns, that each part of the TV series is its own show, then the television stuff is over 600.
After all, I was three years in New Day, which was done three cycles a week.
That spring I was killed there when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full blow and are doing the Tampere Workers Theatre In the long term - the wild roles of anarchistums in the play.
The little brother's gonna be running in the bays for years.
That's what it looks like now, but I don't know about this age.
You always have to take a little reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
Years have left the man behind, too.
And I'm not gonna be alone.
The knee has been operated, the hips congested and the joint is troubled, but when you don't let it bother you too much, that's what you're getting out of here, Esko Roine says.
The TV audience Roine became familiar, among others.
From the pirate radio, as well as a joke about where he and Antti Einio shared hundreds, 100 marks of notes.
It was Antti Einiö, who divided you in hundreds.
I was trying to tell you that they were hundreds and not hundreds.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was an instigating Lieutenant General Raukaallio.
He became the favorite member of the Tampere Police Officers, the department when it happened to be a Commissioner in the same condition.
A cop stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled to me, "It's Rautaallio's great!"
The working group succeeded.
From the theatres to Roga, the mind is lost, among other things.
Producer and Master category of the Helsinki City Theatre, the death of the commercial passenger of the Tampere Employment Theatre and the long-term journey of the Tampere Theatre to the night of the night by night.
It has nothing to do with the fact that the performances have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's my task force. It's a success.
There's also been a number of demonstrations.
The role of Pekka Woodhead in the film is one of those.
There are others.
The reason is that I've done too easily is because I've done too much.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome is not for myself or for the viewers satisfactory.
You can't choose your own work as an actor.
It's just kind of done what they've been told to do.
In addition to the theatre work, Roine has tried to succeed also in business life.
In the '80s he held a restaurant called 'Wanhat Room' in Tampere.
It was a educational experience.
It never happened when I tried to be the director of Tampere Theatre, the actor, and then the nutritionist at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year it came to a conclusion that these things must not be aligned with one another.
It was typical that when the show was over or over, and I had time to figure out if I was going to put on the sauna, the restaurant would have to call that there were friends of yours who hope to see you after the show.
Reminders memories for the honor of the birthday.
On the day of her birth, Esko Roine shows up with memories, ghost writers Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of hair they've brought in a face-stamp from the memories of the woman-stamp.
At one point, when I was playing Zoom, I was called a face-stamper.
I didn't know them for a long time.
The book has been prepared for years.
Roine used to tell me that there's no news bomb in place, because he hasn't done anything so rough, or if he does, he won't tell me.
I made a small compromise in the book.
I'm saying that if someone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading this.
There's a lot of business to do there, as an actor as the director of the theatre.
The publisher's body is that there's also a tour of a crazy theater school student.
It was a pretty normal student life, but the kid had to do all sorts of trick-looking things.
It wasn't as wild as Turka's time.
It was so different.
I don't know how much more than I got out of there to make sure that when the school has gone so far, it's not gonna stick to it if it doesn't get better.
I didn't have to think how good I would have been if I had gone to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häärinen and got to work with them.
After all, there were legends from my first father-in-law since Kaarlo Cuttus.
Pia Hattra and I had very close spaces.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during school.
Martti, the middle boy of the fire, was with me in the same class.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Hutusen.
It's a bad thing he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in such a way that the daughter went to the mother and the boy to me.
I did not think it was a good solution, and I believe that the children are quite agreeable now as adults.
It's not uncommon in the theater circles that silver is put into distribution.
In the case of me, one part was that I worked pretty much at the time.
I was locked up in the theater almost every case.
Then there was a television and a radio on it.
I've been doing a long day and I've been through family life.
Maybe on the day of the party, we'll probably be off the night off.
Esko Roine celebrates the Tampere Workers’ Theatre at the Mental Remedies on 7 September.
On 21 and 28 September, the festival will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre.
There's a lot of pressure that's going to make you feel better.
I was in the 50s at work and I worked for the 40s.
When such an easily moving play occurred, I thought that after the mid-19s, we'd get them off with one spin.
Well, according to Roga, there are no holidays on the actual birthday.
I think it's free, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have stolen some kind of a job that day.
Or maybe it's a strange night off that I'm going to like on the night off, Roine says.
The aviation industry companies are concerned about the production chain.
Some of the UK’s smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that the manufacturing capacity problems in the supply chain may prevent large aircraft manufacturers’ ambitious plans to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In the UK, thousands of companies in the manufacturing chain of aircraft manufacturing are currently enjoying an unexpected number of aircraft and engine development plans that are currently being carried out simultaneously.
Aviation and defence
While some enjoy the order pass, capacity problems at the production chain and price pressure warnings have been given.
"It is true that there is a price pressure, especially now that the volume of production poses challenges," says Craig Gallagher, Director of MB Aerospace, one of the major suppliers of aircraft engines such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing about 240 suppliers of North West Aerospace, of North England aircraft production, more capacity is needed.
"Do strategies and investment plans open for these growth plans?
To be honest, I'm not quite sure about that.
Above all, we need more investment in new production equipment and machinery that is needed to implement these production volumes", Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft buildings are part of the problem.
According to JJ Chrurchhill, CEO of gas turbines, Andrew Churchill, the company has a "happy time" when several new building plans were launched at the same time at the beginning of the year.
We moved in the blink of an eye to a very small production space where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were only paid afterwards, and we were also supposed to try to tighten forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," says Churchill.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing 800 000 pounds in new machinery and hiring 26 new employees.
Many operators in the sector believe that more investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed if the United Kingdom wishes to maintain its position as the second largest operator in the aviation sector after the United States.
The President of the Ford Aerospace and engineer Geoff Ford, Tyneside, say that the order clause should increase the confidence of producers and the desire to expand and increase production capacity, as work must be argued.
"If this doesn't work out, we'll lose in competition against other countries," Ford says.
A few large operators are trying to solve the problem by obtaining capacity.
The company that manufactures aeroplanes and engines belonging to the FTS 250 index, Senior bought up to 75 million pounds of UPECA that manufactures parts of the aircraft in Malaysia.
MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland last year.
"It is possible to buy new business from creative Start-up companies, but it is in fact most likely that production is slowed down by design constraints and by the number of engineers", says Gallagher MB Aerospace, an undertaking called Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engines manufacturers to them.
Some believe that the problems of the production chain operators are being overreacted.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN’s production unit, also serving as a representative trading entity in the UK aircraft sector, says the President of ADS that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There's pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important than what Bryson says.
Both Airbus and Boeing have made mistakes and are now more cautious in order to keep building levels from increasing too fast.
As Boeing attempted to increase its production in 1997, it was in great difficulty when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, director of the Rolls Royce Aeroplane Production Unit, says that the company has not yet faced problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18 000 parts necessary for the manufacture of the jet jet engine.
"We will certainly be obsessive, but we believe that we have done a more thorough work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers when preparing them to increase their operations" Wood says.
According to Boeing CEO James McNerney, the company's manufacturing chain has had time to prepare for the increase in supply volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have worked openly towards journalists, which is very important.
Managing Director of the Airbus passenger shuttle manufacturing unit Fabrice Brégier says that the company will do everything in its power to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 aircraft per month by 2018.
Perhaps one of the suppliers is not successful, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation as well as support journalists and look for alternatives, but there are major problems", Brégier says.
Bregier says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the main supplier.
So this is my work and the work of Airbus."
Hong Kong protest groups will start 'a period of 'a period of non-governmental times' for civil disobedience' in Beijing, in the language of the open elections in Beijing.
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong Hong
The activists supporting democracy are spreading to the streets of Hong Kong after China rejected their demands for open elections.
The groups supporting Hong Kong's democracy highlight that demonstrations can stamp and swear to ensure that the city starts 'an age of non-governmentalism' in order to oppose the reform of the elections proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protestors attacked the flooding horizon in Hong Kong as they traveled to a demonstration organised by the Occuppy Central Group in support of democracy in front of the Council premises responsible for the implementation of laws on Sunday night, where the protestors invited people to participate in a wide-ranging session lecture to break down the city's financial block.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it bans the right of voters to propose candidates publicly in 2017 in the municipal elections organised in 2017 by the mayors, threatening these months of demonstrations that will increase the town’s dual season.
The speakers will take part in the opening of a demonstration by the Occupy Central movement in the presence of key government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want fair and decent elections", says the 24-year-old website operator, Dion Tse, who attended Sunday's demonstration with his 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect the voice of the Hong Kong people.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kongan people.
The Chinese Congress of China's highest law-making body adopted plans for electoral changes which allow only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, a candidate is required to be approved by the 1200-person appointment committee, and opposition politicians believe that this is an effective way of preventing the access of the different political views to the electoral flags.
The speakers will take part in the demonstration organised in connection with the Occupy Central Love and Peace Project, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the government building in Hong Kong.
According to police estimates, over 2 600 people were currently involved in the mood.
A large number of policemen followed when around 100 speakers led by the Scholarism Group were gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hyatt, where member Li Fein of the Communist Party had to stay overnight after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of Occuppy Central, attended the press conference, including with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Schilarism and Federation of Students.
However, in order to comply with the law, he did not state the exact date when road blocking was carried out, but invited the participants to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in "the next few weeks", while adding that the city is officially moving to "an age of non-discrimination".
Benny Tai will answer press questions.
"Look at the person next to you," he said in his Sunday demonstration, standing before the advertising board that represents two disobedient figures in China.
That man will rule the center with you.
Joshua Wong, a 17-year-old meeting representative of Schilarism, said earlier that preparations for protests by high school students are under way and are planned to be held at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to demonstrate their views by refusing to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility", Wong says.
In Beijing, Vice-President Li Fei told the journalists that defending the 'international standards' of public voting rights is 'a waste of time' and that it comes from some Hong Kong politicians who are trying to 'mack society and mislead it'.
"Unusual proposals such as being a public candidate have wasted a lot of time", Li says, calling for the election method to be created in such a way that it is compatible with the real situation of each society and the legal framework for each society.
Only if a large majority, or two-thirds of Hong Kong's 70-person legislative body, is in favour of this, which means that 27 opposition members of the Government can stop the initiative.
He warned us that Hong Kong might be caught up in a prolonged political debate if the proposal for a reform was rejected by veto law.
"It would affect business and city development" he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal survey organized in June by the Occuppy Central in order to oppose China's demands.
Even 172 000 people on behalf of the march for democracy on 1 July, while the march against Beijing and the Occuppy Central against 17 August attracted some 88 000 participants. The estimates of these figures come from the University of Hong Kong, although the police and the organisers' estimates differ considerably from those figures.

This is the latest manual of network users for employees and supervisors, and it is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager website.
According to author Seth God, it's a good idea to identify such comments as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand."
Unless this is the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – i.e. boring and daily – or the benefits it brings are so limited that it is not worth reaching out.
When she was a historian at Harvard Drew Gilpin, she never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that she had nothing new to offer.
Now, principal of the university, he repeats the same thing several times to get a broad message.
Bob Hoffman thinks that TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read the news about the network does not mean that the internet would be good between advertising – just as the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad choice for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that there is only one word to motivate employees: together.
In one study, participants were told that they would solve the problem of cooperation, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not told about cooperation at the beginning.

In the event of a risk of safety, the treatment of the Mount Stuart hospital hospital is prohibited due to the risk of safety due to the risk of security.
The medical surgeon has temporarily resigned from his post, and the UK National Health System NHS stopped guiding patients to the hospital after the hospital problems came up.
Two people went to Torbay Hospital after they had been treated in the Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that he had been in contact with 19 patients who had been treated on 26 July and called them "serious clinical research".
The Mount Stuart hospital apologized for the matter and said that the case had started to be examined after medical separation.
The case came to the hospital in Torbay when two patients who were treated with Mount Stuart applied for it for first aid due to eye problems.
According to Tobay's hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all investigated on the same day required repair surgery.
Tobay Hospital and South Devon and the Torbay Hospital have not directed patients to the treatment after problems have occurred with Mount Stuart.
The interim director David Sinclair of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation, leading to the Toronto Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem at its initial stage and we were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we direct patients to a care provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its licensing matters are in order.
According to Gill Gant, head of patient safety in the South Devon and the Torbay Region, "the patient safety is always the absolute priority, so it is important that these ejaculations are not performed until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe".
Ramsay Health Care UK, the Ramsay Health Care UK, who is managing Mount Stuart Hospital, asked "unfortunately to forgive all patients who had been subject to complications".
The Company was informed that "you know, when we found out about the possible problem, we and the hospital in Torbay were called to all patients concerned".
This specialist has had a medical license for Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has completed 4 537 manipulative surgery in different parts of the organisation. According to statistics, the clinical results of the operations he has performed have been excellent and the percentage of complications has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that your doctor had been temporarily withdrawn from office until a study has been carried out.

The site is divided into a number of sections, i.e. information tables where anonymous users can discuss any possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other web forums, users do not create the same, constantly using profile, and their publications are not preserved.
With the most recent notices, comments may be lost less than a minute when the latest publications replace them in the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creative atmosphere of "4chani".
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known honeys in the network (such as "rickrolling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to the fact that there is a lot of question or direct criminal content on the site.
The most popular notification form of the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is published on a regular basis by NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may include tad porn, but also rough and stimulating images. The anonymous hacker published famous stolen images just on this notice table this weekend.
American CytRx invests CytRx in cancer medicines for research and development in research and development in cancer medicines.
CytRx aims to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
The company that produced biological medicinal products in Los Angeles, which has recently become a target for the development and development of cancer medicines since the sale of the shares in terms of effectiveness, has specialised in research and development of cancer medicines.
The most promising medicinal product is aldoxorubine, which is a more advanced form of corticosteroids commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx performs clinical trials with aldoxumab in treating soft tissue syndrome, Kapos sarcoma associated with AIDS and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It is also a controlled missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body, says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx, on a cancer medicine called aldoxorubicin.
Aldocorphine contains so-called combined technology that acts like a Troy horse.
It binds directly in the blood to a protein that collects also into tumours that directly pass through the medicine into the cancer cells.
I was able to give up the medicine only in an acidic environment, i.e. cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to receive more and more cancer medicines at doses.
"It's like a missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to the rest of the body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on pharmaceutical development, CytRx does not make a profit.
The company sold shares this year and thus raised $86 million to maintain operations and research.
CytRx is currently searching for 400 patients worldwide for a crucial 3-stage clinical trial of alternative treatment for soft tissue disease.
Soft tissue syndrome is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
Alternative treatment is used to treat cancer when initial treatment does not result in results.
If the clinical investigation is successful, CytRx plans to apply for authorisation for a medicinal product from the U.S. Food and Medicines Administration site in 2016, says Kriegsman.
The medicine could then be adopted in 2017.
Analysts say that the data published in December on a previous clinical trial of CytRx showed that aldox was a promising treatment for soft tissue disease.
"We haven't seen any clinical information about how much it's different from the medicine itself," says H.C. Wainwright & Co. Investment analyst Andrew Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed many opinion that this treatment is different.
However, Fei says that it is difficult to predict the results and schedule of the current clinical trial, since it differs significantly from the previous study, which yielded good results.
"Now we have to go right," he says.
Fein compares pharmaceutical development to mining industry.
"In the first place, a lot of money is invested to find that one gold salt, and the investment will continue for so long that that my golden vein will be found," he says.
The money will be spent on research and development for so long that the medicine will be able to commercialise.
A number of shareholders have called CytRx to court because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
In the complaints, the company is accused that it hired a DreamTeam Group, which claimed that it hired people to write positive comments on CytRx and on the other technology company Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Foolin and Wall Street Cheat Sheet on pages such as the pages of Forbesin, Seeing Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the applications, the articles did not find out that the companies paid the commissions to the writers.
As a result of the news, the Seeking Alpha announced that it had removed the articles, "which were actually contrary to practice."
A number of articles on the company were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the accusations.
The company has hired an external lawyer to respond to the action.
"I don't have time or energy to focus on this", Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who are usually seeking employment in biotechnology centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is, in many ways, a wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry," he says.
The views of Analyst magazine
The price of shares in CytRx rose to $8.08 on January 10 and then dropped to less than three dollars in April when the allegations of advertising of shares became public.
According to the Analyst magazine, the claims and the negative public have decreased the price of the shares lower than their real value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to get past this thing as long as the idea is valid."
In the name of the law the camera of the police series was killed in the middle of a description of the camera of the police series.
On Tuesday night, on Tuesday night, when he was shot in the middle of the shooting scene, the illustrator in the name of the Law presented in Finland also died.
The cameraman shot a shooting between a suspect in an armed robbery between a private police department and a fast-food restaurant when he got hit by bullets.
He died quickly of injuries that he received.
According to the police website, in the shooting scene, a person suspected of armed robbery was killed in addition to a cameraman.
In the name of the Law, which is included in the first set of true TV programs, the series has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, the series has been presented by MTV channels since the 1990s.
The question of the third question arises from the crucial role played by Ulvila's death in the court court settlement that started today.
Anneli Aueria is accused of the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahde in 2006.
The court court of Vaasa is now dealing with the case for the second time, for the supreme right was restored to its right of conduct by new evidence.
The purpose of the court's court is that the judgment will be given by the end of this year.
The right to a court of Vaasa was released by Auer in 2011.
In that case, the court considered the possibility of an external agent to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, the Public Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala told the prosecutor about the murder and the circumstances that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our opinion, the crucial question is whether the external factor in the house has been killed by Jukka Laden Anneli Auer in the way and in time.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's story," Kulmala said.
According to the prosecutor, Auer had started a family conflict during which he had announced that he would leave his home and apply for divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where the Lahti was holding onto Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One of them took a kitchen knife", Kulmaala described the events of the night of the death on Monday.
According to the prosecution, several factors prove that there were no external factors on the scene.
For example, the voice call does not include a voice about an outsider.
The oldest child - daughter of Auer - told me in the interview that he saw the author when he left the back room door.
The judgment of the court of Vaasa in 2011 was partly based on the daughter's report.
According the prosecution's state that the daughter's statement cannot be true true true as the state's statement of the daughter's cannot be true true.
"Tyrr didn't see an external factor in his parents' bedroom, even though he went there twice to see", Kulmala said.
The state's new witness has just been associated with the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Laden's sister has told me what happened after the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the daughter only told her that she saw the body of Lahti only when she was in the trunk at the scene of her death.
Auer's defense intends to present to the court investigations whose role the police have not sufficiently been able to resolve according to the defence.
When Vaasa's court was released three years ago from Auer's charges, the court was required to find the dna of a strange man as one of the five factors of the outsider.
The evidence later proved to be a Dna of a scientist working in a Central Criminal Police Laboratory in the Central Criminal Police Laboratory.
At that time, 700 people took the dna sample as mass sampling.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigators were excluded," Juha Manner said.
Another defense of the new witnesses is about the possible external factor.
The Ulvilan woman told the police about a man who had been a poulister who, according to a woman, had admitted to the act.
The police questioned a man this summer.
The prosecution has made a decision that a man who is a porilaism has nothing to do with a spirit crime.
The state's attorney made a request for an investigation for a woman, because the prosecutor is a suspect in a woman's false report.
Another defense of the new witnesses is a nurse who worked the night of death in the centre hospital in Satakun district.
The capital punishment of a century was sentenced to Auer's life sentence for the murder of a life sentence last December.
According to the judgment of the Court of First Instance, the possibility of an outsider to fight against, among other things, the reports of the children of Auer, the voices of the uninterrupted external agent, and the time required by the course of the events.
The judgment came from a voice of 2-1.
A minority judge wrote that conflicting evidence in the criminal case must be interpreted as being in the interest of the defendant.
Therefore, the daughter's report must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions in the report, this had been found in the door of an outsider's exiting fireplace room.
The two oldest children of Auer have been called to hear the court order.
For the first time last year, the girl was heard personally in the Satan district court.
When he was in court, he stopped remembering the events of the night of murder.
Auer's second oldest child named his mother as the killer in a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard about the night of the murder that happened behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer planned to kill for six months.
The son has no obligation to say anything in a matrimony.
The trial of court proceedings will continue today with the consultation of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the consultation of Auer will continue tomorrow.
Ms Auer is currently sitting in prison for more than seven years for crimes of sexual and violent crime against children.
Should the participation of Putin in the G20 meeting be permitted?
The actions of Putin in Ukraine have made him many of the first weddings.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is very much discussing whether or not it should be allowed to enter or not.
Punkrock Activist Group Pussy Riot asked Australia this weekend to ban Putin's participation in a summit involving more than 4,000 representatives from the world's most powerful countries.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20 meeting", Maria Alyokina said to the public at the Opera House, which was packed in Sydney, during the Festival of Dangeous Ideas event.
Kiev has warned us that he is on the brink of "full war" and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "New Russia." So we need to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said, "He's making a decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, Director of the G20 Centre for the Low Institute, Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even though the meeting will be held in the country.
"Austria may decide who it will release, but it is an international meeting," he says.
Just like New York hosting UN meetings or Washington hosting meetings of the International Monetary Fund, "the assignment is not to deny someone invited to enter", Callaghan says.
Last week, Tony Abbott said, "He's taking a decision" after Russia's depraved actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very significant international meeting, Australia has no right to decide on this issue alone.
"But there is an important matter that I will be considering a lot, and I believe that it will also do the other countries in the coming weeks," he says.
People are taking part in an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The event will take two days, and will involve a wide range of representatives of the world's largest and fastest-developed economies, which total about two-thirds of the world's people, which account for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
The members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as some specifically invited guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was asked to balance the different interest rates under high public pressure.
In his opinion, the Prime Minister's best way of dealing with the matter is to take advantage of the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent activities.
"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to use this opportunity to seek a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, it's up to him to give us an explanation of his action," says Callaghan.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressure.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
The Russian rebels are preparing weapons for attack on the bases of the Ukrainian army in East Ukraine at the Donetsk airport in Donetsk.
It is still unclear whether Mr Putin is taking part in the meeting, and according to Callaghan this may not be known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He probably notes that "I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November".
President Bill Shorten takes the view that Putin's Australia is coming 'very conservative', but he understands that it is an international conference.
It is probably time for prime and foreign ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20 whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It is an international, non-Austrian conference, I understand that.
Following tragic events following the Arabian Airlines accident, as well as the lack of proper operational capacity for pity, responsibility and aviation security, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are taking part at the Ukrainian border, I believe that most Australians are very reservations to welcome Putin's wishes to Australia.
Germany's business world criticises "self-ish" Berlin.
Some of the top management companies in Germany warn that Germany has become "a very reliable" and "self-religious" because government policy threatens the country's sub-competitive competitiveness.
The criticism of the government of Mr. Angela Merkel happens at the same time as the major European economy seems to show signs of slowdown, which is why it is concerned whether it is able to run economic growth on its own in a straitable euro area.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of the fierce opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term employees for 63 years.
"I think that the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably leads to a sense of self-prudentiality", according to sales figures, the CEO of BASF, the world’s largest chemical manufacturer, Kurt Bock, says.
EU economy
He says: "It is generally a feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment to a relatively low level. So what's the problem?"
I think there's a great danger here.
The German government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not a favourable environment for businesses, but rather we are focusing significantly more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of BDI, Germany's industrial organisation, "Germany's situation is good now.
In the next ten years, however, each developed economy will have to change. ...[Germany] The reform programme will not make as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce, DIHK, has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, even if it is already one time slowed down in consumption is growing again.
However, the fall in GDP of the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of the export-profit Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2 per cent over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakened performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make a quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber would like the government to "replace public consumption from public to public investment", for example by focusing on the increase in future consumption in infrastructure rather than on pensions.
In Kerber’s opinion, the Merkel government destroys the fruit produced by its democratic predecessor Gerhard Schröder in the early 2000s by strict policy.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of Stiftung Familianenternehmen Foundation for Business, "Germany's situation is still good compared to other countries.
It is a thank-you to companies and not a government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of the neighboring country in France has shown that spending money on social aid and limiting the freedom to conduct a business are the wrong way of doing so.
A leading German banking bank described the situation more clearly, namely that recent government decisions are a disaster.
Germany threatens to lose everything it has done so much for, just to please the voters.
This is my main concern right now," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new board of governments failed to resolve fundamental policy weaknesses that have caused industry to face competitive costs.
At Ashton Kutcher's handicraft music festival, Ashton Kutcher's handicraft music festival with security guard without stopping access to the fan without getting access to the fan.
An actor in Ashton Kutcher took part in the Stagecoach music festival in India, California, where he is reported to have a violent quarrel with a tight security guard.
Ashton Kutcher is told about a time-drunk fight with a security guard in a country music festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him on the backstage at the Stagecoach Kantrim music festival in California, followed by a robbery from his hands, the TMZ website tells us.
Kutcher was at the VIP station when a young woman approached him to say hello and to give him a hand.
The star of the male-sex series went to say hello to the fan, the super-intelligent security guard intervened and caused a nuisance.
An actor and a security guard run a handgun, and Kutcher's friends had to go between themselves to keep Kutcher off, and TMZ tells me.
After his ex-wife from Demi Moore, Kutcher is seeing Mia Kunis, who is the stars of the last 70s show like Kutcher.
The nujakka happened shortly after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from the standard character card of the hit series after he published a video in which he calls the series "happy" and urges fans not to look at it.

The Baltic bacteria killed a vacationer.
Six people have been affected by bacteria from a popular German tourist destination from the Caribbean.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but most of it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria is most spreading in the 20s in the breakout waters most frequently.
"The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct", Dr Heiko Will told The Local, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS).
The bacteria can be found equally in Denmark, Poland and along the coast of Germany.
According to LAGUS, the sick had been on holiday on the island of Odom at the end of July.
He died at the beginning of August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg should be shot.
He went swimming close to Ahrensop's little wound in his leg.
A sick person went to the hospital after he found out on his way home that his leg has turned blue.
Doctors observed blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus bacteria in the leg.
"My husband certainly wouldn't have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known about danger", Sonja Bruehl told the newspaper Ostsee Zeitung.
Severe disease and damage to the patient and the family caused by blood poisoning could have been avoided if the information had been better provided, for example, the destination could have been the subject of information.
The LAG informed the Dpa News Office that doctors were invited to report the next infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no formal notice was given.
Cool temperatures have resulted in a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"The results from the test results of [Manantain] show that V. vulnificus strain has decreased significantly," says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked out.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of the cholera-induced bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person is already suffering from chronic liver disease and a weakened immune response such as HIV or diabetes patients and elderly people.
Men's risk of disease is greater than women because estrogen has been detected as a protective pathogen.
If the bacteria get sick, it'll cause blood poisoning and septicism.
In case of bacteria, the probability of disease loss is about 25 per cent.
V. vulnificus bacteria can also be affected by eating contaminated marine animals, although Dr. Will says that in these cases this is not an infective matter.
The pollution of food from the sea is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, V. vulnificus bacteria caused poisonings last time in 2010, when two people died of it.
Viio Kekkonen: The breast was removed because of cancer cancer cancer cancer cancers.
A 80-year-old singer, Viio Kekkonen, has worked hard to train, but has also been forced to fear his health.
I mean, I can't believe that Viio Kekkonen, who's been radiating, is going to spend 80 years.
She is astonished at how all those years of age can suddenly be so much.
I didn't realize I was this old.
It sounds like 80 years ago, Viio Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday is Viio Kekkonen spending time with his family.
At the end of August, he was awarded a birthday party by the League of Peoples and Pensions in Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, the same place my grandfather was born.
I was almost ashamed of the celebration, the birthday hero tells about the occasion where the stage measured for three hundred was full of congratulations.
A few days later, a meeting took place with the Muhoks to greet Armi Kuusele, whose life Viio Kekkonen remembers that he was following when he was young.
And now we're both this age.
Viio Kekkonen is laughing.
During his long career, there are only a few sides that Viio Kekkos has not seen in public.
One thing he has never said in public: 2006 was removed from the second breast.
The rite was unclear in a point where it was decided to completely remove it.
It wasn't cancer, which I was, of course, happy about.
A new chest was performed during the same surgery, so it was a pretty big procedure.
Viio Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own chest in a way that is unnecessary, since knowledge of the unclear finding would have been a heavy strain and could not have failed to deal with it.
I was just so relieved when there was nothing serious, Viio Kekkonen tells and points out that losing younger ones in his own breast is certainly more difficult.
Read Viio Kekkonen's extensive personal interview for the whole of the day from Night-Sandom.

The farmer is to be committed to the holding of the sea.
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its link with Finnish agriculture is depressing at its level.
The votes of experts have been drowned in political and purposeful opinions.
In particular, during the summer, Helsinki Sanomat and Yle have continued to support agriculture's responsibility for food emissions to the Baltic Sea.
A rapid effort has been required to control emissions.
The average farmer seems to have a few environmental researchers and, with their help, experienced suppliers in the field compared with the over-food expert.
The farmer knows that no nutrient meal can come from cultivation if the field is sown with the same amount of nutrients that are harvested there with the harvest.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires close monitoring and reporting.
Authorities will monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the field have been irradiated into water, even after pollution restrictions, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for many years.
Farmers have the desire and ability to continue working to reduce nutrient emissions.
But everyone should understand that access to a zero level is impossible.
"If you want us to have about a consumption equivalent of agricultural production, you just have to accept that this is the case", Jyrki Akkula, Director of MTT Environmental Research (MT 29.8.) says Jyrki Akkula (MT 29.8.).
The summer that went to the Gulf of Finland brought massive blue-lining plants to the Gulf of Finland.
The researchers were quite unanimous about the fact that the rest received its growing power from its own phosphorus reserves in the sea.
The phosphorus stored at the bottom of the sea is partly the cancellation of the farming of the coastal states for the last decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The treatment of waste water in the growing cities of the Baltic Sea coasts was from the ruin until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also concerns the waste water from the large Helsinki and has not been seen as a problem as regards pollution on its own shores.
Coastal pollution was prevented by building waste water pipelines on the open seas in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water managed there has improved over the years.
The nutrients that soon ended in the ocean will not leave, even if the agricultural land would stop completely from Finland.
Yet every summer, the blue-collar debate and the accusations put forward are always against agriculture today's agriculture.
A public debate marks the farmer responsible for the state of the Baltic Sea.
The blame is excessive, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to achieve political passions.
Under the leadership of Mr Niineninen, the Greens will drive major changes to agricultural environmental standards, under the leadership of their President, Mr Ville Niinistö.
As a highlight board, Niinistö has used summer's rest discussion.
In my words, the producer's representative organisation has accused the MKC of old age and considered it to be the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be some limit in political rhetoric.
Most specific water protection projects are based specifically on the cooperation between the OCTs, farmers and the environment.
The so-called so-called 'invasion' style serves more to fish the sounds of urban greens than to protect water.
I guess that's the point.
With hard speeches, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In the context of policy change, it is up to the MSC to ensure that its members are able to make their living.
It is difficult to trade costly changes for farmers unless there is a replacement for their costs.
The only money Ville Niinistö has put forward is cuts from other agricultural funds.
The repeal of the mining tax does not go through: Palmer
The latest attempt by Abbott's government to throw mining tax into the garbage basket appears to be doomed because Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will abandon it without any changes.
The Australian Labour Party is also concerned that the Government has included in the new initiative a rule that could limit employers' additions to compulsory pension contributions up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in Parliament's House on Monday to rush through the repeal process in the hands of general confusion and in the face of the clear dissatisfaction of the Labour Party.
It set aside the original annulment initiative, which the Senate had previously made significant changes and replaced it with a new legislative proposal, described above all in relation to taxes, pension contributions, social security and social support for families.
Originally, it was an initiative to reverse "enhanced" mining tax and other decisions, such as low-income pension ($3.6 billion savings), income support bonus ($1.3 billion) and bonus ($ 4.7 billion) for school-age children.
Clive Palmer, leader of the Palmer United Party (PUP) did not accept a government transfer.
"The planned mine tax elimination initiative will not be accepted in the Senate without a low income pension, income support bonus and a bonus for school-age children", he Twiitted.
The government needs support for independent parties such as PUP in order to ensure that the Labour Party and Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
Mr Chris Bowen accused the Government of trying to eliminate Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory amount of pension contributions, giving the Minister of Finance all the power of decision.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay further additions, with a 12% target for the amount of pension contributions granted by the Labour Force Party to move up to 2034.
"It's not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, be opposed by any means", Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to suspend future additions.
The body of a man's body was found in Brighton's swimming pool in Brighton.
Sussex's cops picked up the body of an unidentified man before the rising water in the afternoon, and the police closed the area that was near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist destination.
Police and medical examiners are working to find out where the body was on the beach under the circumstances.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Researchers are going through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons have any contact with the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police police, one death victim was killed by an accidental explosion at an accidental explosion at the border border by accident.
According to the Piedras Negras police, an accidental explosion in a customs building at the border between Mexico and the United States caused the death of one woman and the injury of five other persons.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas acts as an operational director of the local police of the city of Texas bordering Texas.
He told the Associated Press News Office that a woman who died in the Sunday explosion suffered skull damage and five others received burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning at the night night night of the customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion will result in the accumulation of gases.
The explosion did not affect border guards.
The three Atlantic City Casino will be closed in September.
Three Atlantic City casinos are closing their doors this month.
A male customer plays in a showboat casino, which is supposed to close his doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to be difficult for Atlantic City for a month when three casinos share their last cards on the table on the table.
Three casinos will close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means, at the same time, that this neo-phobic metropolis, known as the film of money machines, can no longer count as a payout.
More than 5 000 workers are unemployed when showboats and Revel casinos are closed this weekend, the Associated Press News Office told me.
There will be more unemployed when the Trump Plaza turns its light off.
Three casinos, one of which had been able to operate for only two years, expected closure is the city's most recent disaster after the end of the Atlantic Club story only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of city casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times writes.
When the gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, the AP News Office, who suffered from a bad economy.
However, the local gambling industry has received much more competitors when casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania comfort a large part of Atlantic City once so powerful casino casinos.
Even before, Massachusetts, who has opposed to gambling, is looking at his own share of the money by calling to the state to welcome three casinos.
TVO: The new timetable for Areva is difficult to accept is difficult to accept.
According to Voima (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment by institutional supplier Areva that the Olli luoto 3 reactor will only be available for commercial use until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, director of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction works are already well prepared and that the number of work in progress is known.
TVO will continue to evaluate the information received from Areva.
Mr Silveninen notes in the Communication that TVO welcomes all initiatives that can speed up the project.
Ava today submitted an updated timetable for Olkiluto 3 to TVO, according to which the construction work of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial activities could start in 2018.
According to the updated information, the recent delays in the project have been mainly due to the approval of reactor automation systems, which were obtained in April.
This has been the case for four years in negotiations with TVO.
Olkito 3 was originally supposed to be completed already in 2009, but the schedule has been delayed once again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is raised in the arbitration court in which Areva has claimed compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
On the other hand, TVO considers the requirements of Areva to be unfounded and requires approximately EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water operators is needed in the face of global challenges facing global challenges.
International leaders met today in Stockholm within the 24th International Water Week, calling on energy and water operators to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time in order to ensure that there is sufficient water and energy production for the growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting and cleaning water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it immediately affects the other.
These two reserves are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be borne in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, Executive Director of the Stockholm International Water Institute, organised by the Water Week, said at the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are huge".
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to grow by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water operators is urgently needed to find solutions that allow all the peoples of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, who received this year's Water Prize, described water as a possible basis for growth, which is needed both as a society as a whole and as a whole. Briscoe said that "the developing countries face major challenges.
They must mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that "[in the water crisis] does not exist a permanent solution anywhere".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form the spring.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water operators during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally, Professor John Briscoe from South Africa will receive the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King Kaarle XVI of Sweden, in a ceremony to be held in Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that provides research information and provides decision-makers with information in order to enable them to make reasonable decisions on water and sustainable development.
Flying of dead foreign bodies home home in Miami, Miami: Costs of physical flying by bodies: Cost of the cost of the flight of bodies.
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees transported to Miami fell and 14 people were reported dead.
The same happened hundreds of years earlier, and I'm sure this wasn't the last of its kind.
Every year, more than 1 000 Mediterranean migrants die trying illegally to cross the U.S. border.
The first town is ready to die.
It is ironic, however, that once they arrive in the first city in the country, they rarely plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many of these cities, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, a stand-up board, or a better place to spend time waiting for the opportunity.
Few imagine dying there, and as many people approach death, they plan to return back to their homeland.
In popular cities of migrants, a disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily resident in the country, and in them death and return to the country continue working.
It is estimated that about 20% of the dead in South Florida are flying elsewhere. There are more than one in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, the short form of the professional bank of words about human waste) will be flown to the country of origin from the Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to the CEO, Pierson, the largest company in the industry, approximately 80% of this traffic travels abroad. The company is flying bodies for several destinations in the Mediterranean and South America as well as several European countries.

The more migrants move into popular cities, the more they die there too.
Even after death, home return has its own cost.
Miami is the main airport of American Airlines for Latin American flights, and the figures in the table describe the airline's return to its country of origin's remains in 2013.
Return of bodies to the country of origin is not cheap: prices may vary from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
There are also differences between the religious, cultural and general health requirements relating to the flight and delivery of human residues.
The colonial communities of migrants sometimes organise funeral communities to help the costs, because the return of the bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process, and the dead are often young people who do not have insurance.
A few credit institutions and non-formal health insurance programmes have been born from entities established by Italian, Jewish and Greek residents living in New York — the first groups of immigrants in the United States.
The new generations of Mexican, Chinese, Philippines and Bangladesh migrants are now working in many of their favorite cities.

The death of a foreign country is always caused by difficulties, since few displaced people are planning to make their last rest from a foreign city.
For example, in Dubai, without a will in the case of dead foreigners, the Sharia Act is respected, even if the laws on the inheritance of the dead country would be different.
The entire assets will be frozen and then distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
The Aer Lingus Network, which is central to Dublin, is a network for the transport of human waste (
2013) The extent to which the city and the Irish represent is reflected in the cultural population structure of the city and its Irish population.
The airline suspended the service but re-opened it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person travels through or resides there the favor of immigrants through the city’s favor.
On the contrary, a temporary or permanent migration to a migrant city is an open declaration of the way a migrant is to look at life, not death.
However, death in foreign cities means taking the most powerful and irreversible decisions on whether or not they want to belong to the local or global community, the universe or the country, the short term or forever.
The Centre and the Left- Left-The Centre shall issue a division of questions on the issue of non-discrimination on the issue of non-discrimination between the difference between issues.
The opposition parties to the centre and the left are going to ask the government a question of low income income income income income and an increase in inequality.
The parties want to stimulate the debate on people's income problems, which are hampered by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
The growing inequalities are also visible between different parts of the country and within large cities, parties point out in their communication.
In the government budget next year, cuts and tax increases will be directed by parties to low incomes such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary work, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing will continue to grow.
In fact, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say that they are communicating.
There are also worsening problems with working-time incomes.
Parliamentary groups of the Centre and the Left Party will discuss this issue on Thursday.
The third opposition party's basic Finns have already declared that they have left an interim question about police and internal security resources.
The parliamentary term of the parliament will begin tomorrow Tuesday.
The New York City West Indian Day parade will be about to begin soon.
New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest external events of the year, and there also politicians see each other and come to see each other.
The annual parade will be held on Monday in Brooklyn.
It cares about the feats of traditional Carnivals before the fast season, and some of it is dancers who bear complicated, often closed costumes.
Eric Adams, president of the Brooklyn region, is the festival master of this year, but there is also a great deal of other politics with known faces.
The parade is an excellent opportunity for the present and candidate politicians to welcome the public a week before the elections.
Despite the party holidays, violence has also been involved in the earlier years of the Sunday weekend.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including by monitoring the operation of surrounding gangs.
Do you even want to ask me Retortic questions?
Everyone knows retortictic questions, right?
There is no answer to that question.
This figure, that is, a question that is not expected to be answered, but which suggests that in the direction of a certain answer, it tastes both high-level speeches and more daily words.
The beginnings of Cicero's famous Catilina's guilt are chain retort questions, the first of which is "How long, oh, Catilina, you're going to take advantage of our patience?"
The same applies to the questions put to my wife: "Why shouldn't I warm the children five days old chickens?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for a retortician question.
The power of the retort question lies in the fact that the question is open, and the public is encouraged to accept the question.
A highly retortous question gives you the understanding that no one at all could agree with that.
The writer David Williams, who appeared in the 19th century, described the retort question as "some words that have been shown to be admirably designed to make a strong sense of the truth about the subject, while the challenge they put forward is impossible to disagree".
The ability to bend the skills of bending.
Retortic questions can be raised if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several retortic questions, which are designed to express grief or anxiety, are called epiplex.
For example, Job uses them when he makes a call to the Almighty: "What do you do for me that you're going to do... what do you do for me?
Do you have the same eyes we have?
Do you see how you see a person?
My wife's comments include chain chain of retort questions: "Why have you caused children food poisoning?
Are you crazy?
Don't you know how to do anything right?
In addition, there is also so-called hypophora, which is the case when we ask the question and answer it immediately.
Isaac Hayes offers an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is the fear of sex for all women?
Parru!
That's right.
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
Examples from my wife: "What is the only food that the children have eaten and what they may have become sore?"
This chicken.
Who the idiot fed it to them?
You.
Strangely, the retortic question does not usually tend to bend, even though rhetoric means bending skills.
If you're trying to talk about someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already been turned around or getting aggravated by someone's stubbornness, you're gonna need to use the rhetorical questions carefully.
They are more useful in trying to agree opinions than trying to get one to accept one another's own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument that "It's not nice when it's so sunny outside?" the retortic question tells us that the speaker is sure of his argument that it binds the speaker and the public better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no different opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached instead of seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the realistic question refers to the weakness of the argument.
The retorical question in the pages is too often the strongest possible argument in the very weak case: "Did the alien pyramids open?"
In both cases, there is a danger that the question can lead to a reply which differs from the suggested answer.
"Do you think the same thing we do?" was part of the British Conservative Party's risk risk risk margin campaign in the general elections in 2005.
The defense has been destroyed.
Some of these cases have become a hobby, and so-called QTWAIN questions (the concept of Questions To Which Answer Is No, the question of which is no) is in favour of the question.
A few years ago, one of my friends organised a competition that sought the best examples.
The competition clearly won the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?" which was sang by a pop star Gary Glitter before he was exposed to child sexual abuse.
The author has also written the book "You Talk to Me?"
Researcher: The time of the federal Commission may be over.
At the beginning of the conflict in many countries it was still thought that the federal state could be some kind of compromise to the conflict, Saari says.
Russia President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian Channel that peace-making in eastern Ukraine calls for discussions on the state status of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of people living in the East.
Ukraine's transformation into a federal state is, according to Saare, a certain priority for Russia's objectives.
Ukraine will certainly have no doubt that Russia would try to influence Ukraine's internal policy by doing so, he says.
If no resolution is reached, another option could, from the perspective of Russia, have some frozen conflict, where Russia would in practice control Luhanski and Donetski, Saari estimates that Russia would in practice control Luhanski and Donetski.
Western and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending arms and soldiers east of Russia.
Russia has denied the arguments, even though, for example, Russian-minded rebels have said themselves that their troops have fought "on-board voluntary Russian soldiers".
Head of the Upi Head of Mission: Powerful Mission Planned to Kata.
The title reminds me that the work picture is new and still becoming visible.
According to him, Katainen is somehow coordinating or even leading the Commission to work on competitiveness and employment-related matters.
Of course, one of the priorities of the new Commission's programme for the new period is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That's how the Commission's power is at its heart, Tiilikainen says.
Tiilika believes that Katainen's background, economic competence and role during the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plan, there would be no portfolio, i.e. Kata would have no authority over its own Directorate-General.
Instead, Kata would be a team leader in the field of EU competitiveness and employment, which would allow him to have coordinated portfolios not only of the Economic Commission's portfolio but also of other sectors.
In practice, running a team could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Mothers of soldiers: up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organisation, Ukraine has been deployed by up to 15 000 Russian soldiers in the past two months and there are currently more than 7 000 Russian soldiers in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to organization, the hospital of Rostov, a hospital located near the border of Ukraine, is identified by the wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of soldiers collect their data from soldiers' relatives.
The Military Union NATO has estimated that there are over 1,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte's alcohol use is, "A little thing comes up after a drink".
Big Brother Jussi and Andte took a look at the life of BB house on Monday night.
Jussi, on the side of the basement, went on Monday night for a gym bike with Andte, belonging to the people of Kartano.
Two wondered what they were doing to the viewers of the program.
Not before he saw it, Andte said.
In my opinion, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
The potential party or tasks make up only a fraction of the life of the BB House.
It's more to wait and wonder and talk and live.
Ande, Anne and Jussi.
The people of the Cartano spent Wednesday night in wet marks and the alcohol especially got Andte on the phone.
Even when he was young, he asked Andtel if the party had made him more comfortable in the house of his life now that he had been able to talk to them with other people.
A little drink, and then there will be a case, Andte admitted.
Look at Andten's interview from the ITV video.
Anna Abreu exposes her body body life in Me Nais, Me Nais.
Anna Abreu tells us in the magazine Me Females that she decided to lose two years ago when she stayed on the job break.
At that time, when she was tired at the time, she thought that she would get more energy due to weight loss.
Fred Monta / Quick News
Give me a dream a couple years ago about the type of body in the Victoria's Secret models.
My body design was Victoria's Secret style.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, so Anna tells the paper.
Anna, who performs her body with gigs and music videos, says that she's not some kind of sweat coach, even though she's been named that.
Vienna Kytöjoki
Timm's in good condition Anna practice in gym and play boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I get a certain amount of weight at the gym, Anna points out.
In the meantime, a pop star gives itself permission for a treat.
If I'm gonna treat you, I'm gonna be really delicious.
Sometimes I'm gonna pull out other people who are unhealth, and I don't think I'm gonna see if there's more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I'm upset if I do something bad to my body.
Terhi Ylisäinen
Let him say he likes his body.
The distribution of profits by companies is pleasant for shareholders but does not increase growth.
Are the leaders of Australian stock exchange companies now merely trying to please a large number by granting shareholders a share in the desire for greater profit distribution and by buying back their shares?
Is the decision to move from the companies' governments to the shareholders served by the government?
The distribution of profits is the most important thing, and last week the reporting period ended last week at the end of 2014.
The prices of the shares of companies that have prized investors in the form of buy-back schemes and by sharing more profits have clearly increased.
There's nothing wrong with it.
The reverse side of the coin is, however, that capital consumption is reduced faster than the analysts have predicted, and this is a fact that many people are asking whether the popularity of the short term is too much emphasis and whether there is sufficient focus on future and long-term growth.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business through other means.
For example, more money is acquired from a low-priced stock market.
From a business point of view, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, whereas the capital is not.
Even if the funds purchased on the market are not taken into account, it is clear, however, that openness to shareholders is primarily financed by the company's use of less money to invest.
The net return on the flow of this purchase programme (and the cancellation of the profit investment plans) is the loss of capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period "the period of capital decrease", during which companies have tried to keep the number of shares down by all means.
As part of the same plan, businesses have less and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the buy-back programmes amounted to USD 3.7 billion and the value of the expected unrealised equity procurement programmes amounted to EUR 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it considers the use of capital as a curse in a title of its report.
While we now have figures confirming that this trend exists, informal evidence has been available for months.
The Governor of the Central Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, considered it sufficient to note a few weeks ago that companies need a little more "residence" to increase investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the prospects for individual companies, but about the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital spending tends to have negative consequences for economic growth and employment in general.
Credit Suisse says that "the reporting companies' own estimates of the expenditure of their capital have decreased on average by four per cent over the previous two years.
The estimates of free cash flow have risen by an average of 2%.
The improvement of cash flow is likely to increase capital consumption.
This quick look seems good from the point of view of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also evidence of corporate obedience.
If I had a coin every time the Executive Director said that the price of the short-term share would not be important, I would... well, the end of the sentence would be easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
Managing Directors will closely monitor the price of the shares and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of the CEOs are defined according to the value of the shares, and the position of the directors depends on it.
Managing Directors would like to say that some decisions (or whether they were commercial, increased investment in an organisation or profit distribution) are not necessarily always immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business managers often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach in the investment market.
Therefore, the current lack of conservativeity seems to be accepting short-term objectives.
However, in the reporting period that has just ended, it was too clear that the weight was in the reduction of capital consumption in the capital of the future, and the most sustainable companies were encouraged.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, kept the leader in reducing the consumption of capital, but also many other companies did the same — part of the escape and part because they feared the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, do investors put pressure on companies to share profits?
According to Credit Suisse’s strategicist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other traditional fixed-income investment products have decreased since the central banks have calculated global interest rates in order to bring more money to the market.
In turn, investors are forced into the capital market to seek profits and, in turn, they are pushing companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would rather have money when more and more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that profit distribution has a significant impact on the cost of companies and not on the increase in turnover.
The leaks of public images appear to have been caused by the flow of data or by breaking into an e-mail account or by breaking into an e-mail account.
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources tell me that the unknown hacker who leaked videos on the Internet wonders about security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female public persons in a chat room and said that he has more pictures of women, some described above have reported that their images are faked while others have said that it was a long time ago the images were removed.
There is a lot of pictures, and it is said to be a part of, among other things, Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winston.
After the hacking, the main question is what has been the attack on the ground.
What were the pictures and videos of real and where they were loaded from?
The most recent source of photos — an unfavorable and thorough attack on Apple iCloud’s service — is the most unlikely option.
Major companies such as Apple have invested in security teams working inside the house, which are responsible for trying to penetrate the company’s own systems regularly.
"A large scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim is true", observes Rak Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for the hacking of these public-related hacks (and for less famous people each day) is the leakage of an e-mail address and password, either by guessing or by echoing information, i.e. by peaking the person to log in to a genuine-looking site, followed by the use of these data against them.
Apple continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used on iPhone to record settings and, above all, to backup images when they are transferred to the cloud server.
You can login to the account of the user via iCloud by giving you this email address and password, then you can download their image and other information from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account owner has introduced a two-step identification ("two factor authentication", 2FA), i.e. an additional protection against entry into the account, when the code is sent to the owner’s mobile phone before the account can be registered.
However, relatively few uses a 2FA feature, either because it is unknown, or because it is considered incomplete.
Apple continues to examine whether all the information is derived from its iCloud service, and if so, how far were they infiltrated users' premises?
The company has not delivered an opinion on this matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forgotten Password" link at Apple iCloud by first collecting the email addresses of the public persons, for example in the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that publishers have used the same password in several services, when passwords were stolen through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's pictures claims that the pictures are genuine, but do not tell us when they are taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that this could be a long-term hacking firm.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a rough trouble.
I'm sorry about all the other people who're involved in hacking," he wrote in his Tweet.
However, the independent safety expert, Graham Cluj, notes that Winston may have thought that he had removed the pictures from his mobile phone, but removing the image from modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the picture.
Modern smartphones record images on a regular basis to the cloud service because they often do not have enough space for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple iPhone standard setting is to save images to iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft's Windows Phones to record images to OneDrive.
Independent service providers such as Dropbox offer automatic images and data storage services.
"The people take and remove pictures, but they don't realize that the pictures are downloaded from the account", Clueley says to The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees: "Absolved doesn't always mean deleted," he says.
Photos and videos can be stored for years.
If someone gets access to the user's email address and password, they can reload all photos and videos sent via email.
From Apple's service, photos can be downloaded for Mac, Windows PC, or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was claimed to show videos and images taken from Windows PC that have not yet been published.
Two-step identification protects against such hacking because it requires everyone who tries to copy an existing account to another device to enter the original user's device, usually the code sent to their mobile phone.
Without code, access to the account will be prevented.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-step recognition account, but it is not yet known whether those public individuals were using the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures they say are not real.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures that Grande is supposed to have are "the whole fakes".
Victoria Justice wrote in his ink: "I'm sorry you don't understand.
Let me break the rumors immediately in its beginning.
Cluley presents a second option.
Since the applications were subject to disclosure, their accounts may have been broken by someone who managed their social media accounts or kept their e-mails on a regular basis.
"I'd like to know if there's an actor agency or a representative involved," he's wondering.
However, those public bodies do not use one publishers or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems or helped it in the configuration of the victim of the security attack, and changed the secret system so that all information can be returned.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chaney, a florist who received the Hollywood Hacker, where the hacker distributed pictures from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis' e-mail accounts in 2011, and was sentenced for 10 years in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66 000 damages.
Chaney was accused of entering more than 50 people in the entertainment industry from late November 2010 to October 2011. In some cases, he asked Aguiilera for photos of the star in low dress, and then published pictures online.
Chaney later apologized to say that his actions " must have been one of the worst of privacy violations that you can imagine."
Chaney was also claimed to spy on two people online for more than ten years.
Cluley says, "In the case of Chaney, the stars' e-mail accounts were hacked and changed so that someone sent them their information even after changing their password."
Cluley says that the coercive action of hacks that break into these accounts "remembers the collection of perverts".
They just want to gather information like that.
It is possible that in this case someone had encountered a list of information and account information containing a list of services such as Dropbox.
hackers have also been able to try to penetrate for a long long long long long long long to long long long long long long long long long long long long long long by hackers have also been able to
or they were able to access data from an e-mail account, such as their address book, and then fishing for information from other persons.
I don't think it would be a simple iCloud security gap.
Australia has provided its intelligence service to assist the UN to track 44 Peacekeepers who were kidnapped by terrorists associated with al-Qaida in Syria.
A terrorist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, is believed to consider 44 Fijin peacekeepers imprisoned, and this terrorist group invaded the crossing site on the Golan hills last week and forced the UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since the middle of the week, and there is no information on their location.
At the same time, ministers taking part in the UN Conference of the Small Developing Islands, including the Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with the UN Secretary-General Ban ki-Monon at the summit, and he has provided Australia with help to save the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN wherever it can, by providing assistance, including intelligence," he said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We are very close to all the cooperation and friends of the intelligence network -- to ensure that we can locate them and ensure that they are safe.
Bishop has already convinced the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Baiimarama, and the Foreign Minister, Ratu Ioke Kubuabola, that Australia will use its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippine Peacekeeper Group, which was held captive in military armies, was reported in a different part of the same controversial region.
The United Nations has been monitoring Golan's hills since the 1974 ceasefire in Syria and Israel.
The frauders are trying to steal your money by means of an initiative to repeal the carbon tax, warning Australia's competition authority ACCC, to warn Australia's competition authority.
The frauds are using the carbon tax elimination initiative to steal money, the ACC warns.
The SCAMwatch department has warned consumers and businesses to trust government agencies too good to offer thousands of dollars of credit.
Contributors may use figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save for the purchase of goods after the withdrawal of the carbon tax and offering this up to $7 000, the warning says.
The frauds may seem very convincing because they have discovered the personal data they use for their benefit in trying to obtain bank data or trying to make the victim pay the fee.
They are discussing current topics to deceive the victim.
The frauds use more than carbon tax evasion to get their hands on the money, and their stories are more and more advanced, and they are using up-to-date things to build a scam around them.
Also, on a flight from the Malaysian Airlines airline MH370 lost aircraft and the death of Robin Williams has been inspired by cheaters.
The ACC instructs you to contact the company using self-expressed contact information rather than contacting the caller if there is no doubt about the identity of the representative caller.
If you receive an unexpected call or an email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the abolition of the carbon tax, beware.
If you think you've been fooled and given personal information or transferred money to a faker's account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, government-sharing free money – it is likely it will be.
Economics: Lipponen praised the EU's Russia sanctions against Russia.
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia in the interview of Economic Councils.
Russia's priority policy is to give its own advantage.
There may be no need to force this," says Lippinen in the interview.
Lipponen has started work as a provider of the business of the EC Arctic regions of the Central Business Union.
He is concerned that the EBRD and the EIB of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development interrupted Russia's project funding as part of the EU's economic pacts.
"This means, for example, that environmental projects of the northern dimension with clear visibility go on ice", Lipponen says in the interview.
The freezing of funds now hampers cooperation, which Lipposen believes may find it difficult to rebuild if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in working with the Arctic region continues to be as great as it was before.
He is currently reporting to the EC on the Arctic policy of Finland and the opportunities for businesses in the north.
It does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report looks forward, we'll talk about ten years," he says.
Rarely, that the elephant comes to a low water or near an institution, Visa Heinonen, Visa Heinonen, from the lecture centre of the Museum of Northern Finland.
In the Summer Gulf of Vaasa, a Norwegian was seen swimming near the beach this Sunday.
According to Heinen, the Norwegian is likely to have come after the Summer Gulf food.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
According to him, for example, the Sundom Bridge sees, especially in the spring and autumn, elephants that arrive specifically for fish.
However, Norway is not a common species in Vaasa's marine area.
In pay, we'll see the norm in the villas' seats, and he'll continue.
Norppa lives in the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, among other things.
According to the South Australian court court, the murdered pizzer-owner Robert Vallelonga, the murdered pizzer owner, Robert Vallelon, acting aggressively and violently outside of the night club outside the night club.
Murdered by the Southern Pizzeria owner Robert Vallelon, Robert Vallelon.
In the trial of justice, it has been established that the pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressively acting towards both his partner and security only minutes before he was killed outside the night club.
In the lower court of Adelaide, lawyers accused of killing Vallelonga asked for the release of their client against guarantees because it was "clearly" for self-defence.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not sufficiently serious to keep his client whose identity has not been published, behind the tents until the trial.
"According to evidence, the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the night club," he said.
After that, it started with a cocoon, resulting in this 40-year-old man- tearing off his security shirt.
It is important to note that according to the prosecutor, death was caused by one stroke, which clearly indicates self-defence or defence of another.
A 25-year-old man is only accused of killing for the time being.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious at the Rundle St and Synagogue Place crossing from approximately 2.25 p.m. on 4 May. He had severe head injuries.
He died of his injuries in the royal hospital of Adelaide the next day, friends and customers of pizzeria remained dying of one Tree Hill's "local legend".
According to the prosecutors, there was no reason to kill the accused, and after the incident he had said to the taxi driver, "he was forced to sleep for a few days.
But the security video now proves something else, Shaw says.
"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively - his partner tried to calm him down and got himself part of the hard and violent behavior," he says.
Our client's side is both a assumption of innocence and evidence that he defended himself, which is to be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of a man because only one of the three security officers who were present on the day of destruction had been deprived of the use of Vallelonga.
According to them, other security guards didn't think him was a threat, because "he was short", and he used a large man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical conflict.
They said that the case was also clearly seen by a taxi driver who would prove that Vallelonga was hit "powerfully" and had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be arrested until the next week when he would declare his decision.
The contested dolphin yacht began in Japan - justified by tradition - Foreign news - Ilta-Sanomam
Bad weather was expected to delay the world widely at the beginning of the vicious hunting.
On Monday, in the city of Taiji, Japan, the annual dolphin hunting season started again.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
A great deal of opposition from the yachts worldwide, among other things, is the British newspaper Guardian.
In the hunt, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins into a remote desert, where mammals are slaughtered after the most suitable individuals have been selected among them for transport to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The flesh of the dolphins also ends up as food.
According to the local authorities, however, the beginning of the hunting was expected to delay due to poor weather.
The practice spread to the world in 2009 with the documentary film of The Cove on the subject.
During previous hunting seasons, huntings have also criticised diplomats, in addition to animal hunters, as well as diplomats.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat has in any case a limited market for its high mercury content.
There is a tradition for those defending hunting, including the Japanese Government.
The defenders have also reminded me that the dolphins are not endangered.
The dolphin hunt was opposed during the weekend in several countries with demonstrations.
According to the protesters in Tokyo, the hunt for damage to Japan's reputation in the world.
On Monday there was also a demonstration in Helsinki in front of the Japanese Embassy on Monday.
Of some NATO members, some NATO member states are uncertain about the establishment of new troops in Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe.
The military union within NATO is divided into whether Eastern Europe and the Baltic should set up NATO bases in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times newspaper.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military union to bring their countries with permanent force, but Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has been against the plan.
" Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russia's policy and is threatening to lose European security", said Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the London Royal United Services Institute.
The NATO Member States are gathering at the beginning of the week, and the military union is expected to publish its new contingency plan.
The central question of the plan is whether NATO could break the TAE Agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
That NATO and the Warsaw Alliance agreed on how they will place armed forces in the Atlantic-Ural Mountains area.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic Sea.
Russia frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not actually cancel the agreement.
In view of the tense situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"There must be NATO resources in all the NATO countries that need resources" said Sir Malcolm Rifkind Financial Times, Chairman of the British Parliament Security Committee.
Matt Guthmler the youngest world flying around the world by Matt Guthmler.
While other teenagers were teaching me how to drive a car, Matt Guthmiller learned how to fly.
Since the age of 19, Guthmiller just became the youngest flying around the world — and, on his own, reported CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
Young people living in the state of South Dakota flew 30 000 miles 23 times in 15 different countries in five continents.
We're on our way to Guthmari as a rock star thanks to his record-looking flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"It's too risky" and "Whoever spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun."
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the performers of such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that, with my record, I will also inspire other people to go to the world and do big things.
Guthmiller's flight promotion started when he was young, and first he asked his parents to eat at the airports cafes.
Later, he insisted on getting to the flight halls.
My parents let me out for a short, 20-minute visit to a 20-minute visit, but I think they're back in time at the time that my enthusiasm for it ended.
He didn't stop.
Guthmiller soon made a contract with his parents to give him more time in the cab.
I agreed to share a car with my father over the entire high school year instead of getting my own car.
I could fly planes in a trade shop.
By the age of 17 years, Guthmiller had received a licence and two years later he leased a single-engine Beechcraft aircraft for his exclusive flight around the world.
A young man who studied at the MIT High School had himself taken care of the aircraft's maintenance and made fuel calculations.
For many hours in the upper court, he also meant that he himself needed an additional guarantee--
virtually a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says that he ate a few inventions throughout a long trip.
Flying in the clouds was both wonderful and scary.
Air traffic controllers in other countries were not regulated to help them make navigation around storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just slightly above the plane and which reached 45,000 feet high and ripped into pieces of the aeroplane.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The fuel volume of the machine would not have been higher.
On the day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on his plane dropped from the flight between America's Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his most difficult journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he felt that the increase was technically challenging because of the large amount of fuel required for a flight of 16 hours.
Despite the serious and even high-quality climate, Guthmier managed to break the record and collect money for ICT training through the Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he set up his own company at the age of 12 years.
The objectives of Guthmiller are here in the sky.
I mean, it'd be great to start the next Apple, but let's see what happens.
In any case, Guthmiller is going to aim high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right Franchise entrepreneur is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was thrilled to have fans running his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after the Canadian W-channel began to show the Cupcake Girls program in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one French entrepreneur was not an appropriate task.
"My French entrepreneur sat in his car and called me that a hundred potential customers are going to be running outside the store ready to buy a cup of coffee, and he can't stand the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the event, Joyce decided to change the selection process for franchise partners, starting with the emphasis on the management of the company's culture rather than the bakery skills.
"Whoever can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear," he says, adding that he has kept about 100 interviews for each 11 Franchise movement.
We start with six weeks of training, but workers work in a completely different way in the working environment themselves, so the whole process is rather difficult, which is why we have training to stress, above all, the appropriateness of the business culture.
Finding the right Franchise entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small enterprise.
A strong and honest leader can edit and raise an organization, while a leader who is poorly suited to the mission can cause expensive harm to the company.
"I thought it was like looking for a French entrepreneur on a date, but it's not true at all, you can do a lot to get to know someone before you get married", Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a French partner, a signed agreement will be signed, a security will be secured and a new store will be built.
Getting into partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and a major confidence test.
The symbolic relationship between the Franchise parties is similar to strong marriages, as they have shared objectives, explains Lorraine McLachlan, President and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
Therefore, McLachlan considers that the French entrepreneur should also be careful in choosing the future French donor before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"That's the same idea as human relationships: if a date mate is rude already on a date, imagine what he's like in a marriage?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose with care and assess the future contractual partner and pay attention to even the smallest alarms on either side.
McLachlan adds that French dancers like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time as a French grant, the players must be more concerned when choosing the first, most important partners.
On the other hand, it is assumed that the new franchise actors will have to conclude on the basis of a successful parent company what challenges they have had to face and what skills the new franchise company needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as franchise candidates may also request the assistance of a French consultant to create a profile based on practices in the field.
McLachlan also recalls that for the first time it is possible to provide a great deal of assistance on the CFA site at Lokforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will make it easier later, as French teachers learn how to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first French entrepreneurs can provide advice and help in the evaluation process.
"The first French partner's contribution helped Brian (Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK? founder and CEO) significantly in this creation of the company and the franchise system," says Erik Church, the operational director of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies from 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something that he could not have created alone, so the first French entrepreneurs should choose this idea in mind.
There are 216 franchise entrepreneurs who represent all three brands of O2E, and he is also a partner of the Toronto Franchise Group of You Move Me.
It's a simple method for finding the right French partner.
"Let us have a confidence test to ask myself, 'Do I call this person to me for the weekend at the barbecue?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend a lot of your working days looking for solutions with them for major business challenges."
It also notes that O2E Brands is largely grateful for its success in its French structure.
In an enterprise, leaders often see their position as short-term and lower-relation leadership levels as very formal, while the French entrepreneurs engage in a partnership with the long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the enterprise.
"The French partnership has much more good aspects than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intensive," he says.
It is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
This partnership is more difficult, but well managed, it produces better results.
In the northern parts of the United States, the price of cereals will fall in the prices of cereals in the north of the United States.
The delayed transport of trains has led to a significant drop in prices of cereals in the north of the United States, weeks before massive catches are expected to be under new pressure from the transport network.
Commercial cereal farms in the state of North Dakota provide farmers with only $2.7 from bussel - about a dollar less than steering prices - mainly because of the cost of ensuring the capacity of the incoming rail rail services, traders and agricultural organisations.
In raw materials
The most acute problems are Warren Buffet Berkshire with the BNSF railways and the Canadian Pacific railway undertaking.
The Federal Railway Supervisor is organising a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
In the north of the plains we have to rely on iron for the transport of agricultural products because they are far from river nets.
The delay in rail transport increased as a result of a very cold winter in 2013, resulting in slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken's oil-based oil industry has been marginalising the transport of cereals, which is not true according to railway companies.
According to the director of an international trading company, the costs of the sellers storing and transferring cereals for the purpose of ensuring the use of the train have risen from zero to over $2,000 a year from zero in a wagon of up to $2,000 a year.
Someone has to pay the costs.
"These costs are due either by the farmer or by the client," says the director of the cereal business.
The United States Agriculture Agency estimated that the soya beans in North Dakota would grow by more than a third and that the spring crop would grow by 16 per cent.
Randy Gordon, Chairman of the National Grain and Feed Organisation (NGO) says that "We are normally trying to start a new harvest from a clean table, i.e. sufficient storage space and grain have been empty to the harvest and sold and transferred.
But now we're late for last year's service problems.
The railway undertaking BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will deal smoothly with the transportation of this year's harvest.
John Miller, vice-president for the transport of agricultural products by BNSF, said that the company has reduced the length of long-range transport (trains ordered by customers, which have taken more than four days) from the beginning of April, 16 500, about two thousand.
"We've moved almost all the old crops that we were supposed to transfer," Miller says, referring to the remaining grain from the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported rates of BNSF grain trains were 9 per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that development is "inefficient" but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the processing capacity of all types of transportable products such as cereals.
The speed of trains of the Canadian Pacific Railway Undertaking, which has been having problems, is 11 per cent lower than in the same year, but clearly higher than in the early year's much lower speeds.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has said to the Railway Supervisor (Surface Transport Board) that the changes made to its train charter system should improve its ability to deal with traffic during the period of 15 to 20 % of the period to come.
"The action plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company focuses on the continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient use of trains so that we can deliver more and more trains every week" said the representative of the railway undertaking.
The Ukrainian crisis could solve the "identity crisis" of NATO.
The leaders, diplomats and experts of major countries have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of the NATO Afghanistan mission will also mean the meaning of NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as is apparent from the NATO Summit in Wales Cardiff this week, involving 60 leaders, including the US President Barack Obama.
The agenda for political and diplomatic missions does not have a shortage of crises in the world, even to the extent that the exit of Afghan troops, which had been a priority before, is no longer the most important thing.
On the other hand, the 28 Federations of States are needed after Russia has re-elected into Ukraine, and this is a shocking reminder that the threat of Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
The world's leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and re-enactment in defence cooperation.
In some sense, NATO is grateful for Vladimir Putin.
"It (NATO) was somehow looking for a -- and it was in the process of a rather significant identity crisis", says Heather Conley, Head of the European Programme for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
NATO has not merely found a new purpose but has also been strengthened.
Obama has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy for the rapid success of the Israeli and Syria of the regime for the overthrow of the military forces of the Islamic State.
According to official opinion, the President will face significant challenges in his attempt to inspire his former partners in the war to respond militaryly, especially to something that would cross the border between Iraq and Syria.
President Obama, however, is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy by which extreme Islamics are won, having first stated directly that "we do not have a strategy".
Western experts have set the summit with caution to see whether there are breakthroughs in Ukraine or in the Islamic State.
Agri-food packages are designed to be the main means of punishing the event called an attack on Ukraine by Russia.
The European Union officials discussed the matter this weekend, but rejected the decision on new sanctions.
US officials pointed out that the countries from which Obama hopes the main partners in the Islamic problem are not necessarily members of NATO.
The accumulation of the problems could not be predicted two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was held by the regime of the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates took his last floor in order to say that the organization has almost reached the point of "common military importance".
The US officials continued to complain about the fact that other states did not achieve their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to use two per cent of their gross national product for defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this target last year.
But now the officials of the White House say they've noticed the change.
NATO members are expected to sign a contract in Cardiff in which they promise to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time there is a genuine desire for the company to see possible threats to the Member States' real size.
Following Russia's entry into Ukraine, the union's defence promises are more important and important than once after the end of the Cold War," says Charles Kupchan, President of the U.S. Security Council of the United States.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach agreement between 28 Member States.
Obama will use a large part of its journey to reinforce its commitment to a defence cooperation in favour of Russia's concerned neighbouring countries.
The President will begin his three-day trip with a lasting visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet both the Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian leaders.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined Ukraine's Crimean bordering country this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when a new contingency plan, which will be published this week, will be put in place.
The plan aims to shorten the time that NATO needs to respond to attacks in the border regions of the border states, officials say.
The plan is to increase air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes cover a small risk for NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases for the kindness of Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of Russia's friendship with Russia.
According to officials, the new plan does not really break the treaty, but it may also be just a semantic difference, says a Western diplomat who did not want to be called public in the context of the discussions before official information is made available.
The presence of NATO is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, diplomat said.
Putin's effective "talviase" will he use it for Ukraine?
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeve with respect to Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putinia of armed forces in eastern Ukraine and of sending Russian troops to Ukraine's soils.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine has deteriorated, the Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a master card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine’s primary energy sources are natural gas (40 %) and coal (28 %), Geysar Gurbanov, an active member of the University of Harvard, writes according to Business Insider.
During the next four months, when the winter comes to Ukraine and the coal mines are located in the eastern half of the conflict, the Ukrainians will remain in their homes when the gas supply from Russia is exhausted.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to reach their goal, Gazprom, the Russian energy left, will help Putin to win the war in the end, Gurbanov will write.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine due to unpaid invoices on 16 July.
Last month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine's debt of gas was USD 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think no one thinks about it (winter) anymore except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier to resolve matters.
First, the immediate end of hostilities and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
The necessary repairs must be made in order to complete the stock again and make provision for a cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not press ahead of the Separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Aristair Newman, Japanese holding company Nomura, noted last month that Russia's talks on humanitarian issues and the possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be strengthened in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist operations until then.
Moscow has already been notified that Ukraine will have to pay for future gas supplies unless Kiev is paying off its accumulated debts.
The EU will endeavour to negotiate an agreement allowing the continuation of gas imports on a provisional basis.
Last week, Prime Minister Arsenik said that Russia is planning to stop gas supply to EU countries in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak told us that the speeches are immediate.
According to him, Russia will do everything in its power to supply gas to EU countries.
The Liberal-Limali-Lisbonloggari received 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand exterminations.
The Saudi Arabian Court has held a ten-year detention sentence for Raif Badaw, founded by the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement in May.
The judgment includes an additional fine of a thousand fines and a fine of a million lariel (approximately EUR 200 000).
The trial was justified by the fact that he had set up a website that despises Islam.
The judgment was notified to AFP on Monday by Suad al-Shamari, another founder of the organisation.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
In July 2013, Badawi was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and 600 attacks, but the judgment was appealed and rebutted.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnessy International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Rally Adult childhood experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the most revolutionary human encounters"
Madventures published today a new book World explanation - an explanation by an adventurer for everything.
We asked Riku Raltala for an explanation of the future of the world and differences in Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells us about the most significant human attack in your life.
The author, the journalist, the other half of Madventures, Riku Rantala is a busy man.
Today, a new book has been published, yesterday there was a movie practitioner at the National Library and Wednesday starts Yle's second production period in Docventures.
Ever since then, he's been running from one place to another.
From the morning TV to the day home and from there to the weekly meeting.
An interview with the most beautiful person on the face must be transferred to the phone interview.
If you don't, you won't have time.
In the middle of everything in the middle of his life and in the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write a book about the World account, which is, according to the cover of the book, an adventurer's manual for everything.
For everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is better than the other one, why we are here and who we really are.
We enjoyed interviews that we've been doing over the years.
The book includes professors as well as artists.
We've been working on the book for about a year, and Riku tells IS on the phone.
You've been barking up a pretty big piece of paper.
What is the central message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more and big questions about the world is worth thinking about, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the idis is to be good travel readings, but it is also meant to make people talk and share ideas at home.
The debate may even lead to action, Riku tells us.
KChart: Pete Aarre-Aptito
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We came to the conclusion that the species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, it is necessary to believe that at some point we will make solutions to improve our situation.
The earth is a kind of alcoholic.
At first it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophy.
According to some studies, Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
This could lead to the conclusion that when enough money is available and that our basic needs have been satisfied, we are happy.
Money is no more happiness.
We want to wake people up to discuss what is enough.
It is not enough to make use of our natural resources to do this for much longer, Riku says.
In your book, you also considered cultural differences.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People don't really differ.
Of course, there are different starting points for such as education, health and hygiene.
The biggest difference is that the Community's importance is far greater in India in terms of both good and bad.
When the western countries are prosperous, people live more alone.
Let's separate ourselves and it may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
If we were to find a proper balance between communityism and loneliness, we would be pretty lucky, Riku tells us.
The crime has hit a lot of different people around the world.
What is the best way to get people into his mind?
It is based on my childhood, when I was with my family on the first great journey abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan when my father was there in the United Nations.
I was seven years old and two of my younger siblings were involved.
My brother was just a baby.
In Finland, a large mobile car was transported to Finland.
We were driving a war in Afghanistan when there was a huge number of refugees on the road roads.
On the road, a girl of my age walked around with her little brother.
I was sitting on a big skank's bench in the hands of a chef cane.
We've got eyes on you, Riku describes us.
You're an old boy who knows what's going on.
It was one of the revolutionary human beings that I always come to remember.
KUI: Leena Koskela
Rikku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
That's when the Riku went to the potassium that other people must be respected, even if they were significantly poorer or they wouldn't have the same conditions of life as we do.
The break already realized at that time that money cannot be a measure of human dignity.
From the memories of the adults, the people faced in New Guinea are coming up.
I couldn't stop wondering how traditionally people live there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, not very much using money or metal tools.
They live under very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
I had to think about it.
And to think about what he wants with Tutta to do to get the readers of his new book, too.
The idea is that our book inspires people to read, look and listen to more.
So that it could make people feel warm about making love to the conversation, or even until the fist fight, Rikki throws it.
It's about Kauhaaki magazine.
The events began when the couple arrived by bus and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi got off, the man in the yard threw a taxi after some object.
The driver rose out of the car, as well as the man who was a passenger.
A man who was playing the performer stabbed a man passenger life-threateningly in his head and in his hand and left the place.
The stabilator is a tank of 170-75 cents, short-haired man.
According to the paper, there has been a young, light pony-tailed woman near the scene.
We hope to contact the police.
Police will also request guidance from all those who may have observed events or persons involved in the case.
The incubation took place on Wednesday 27 August at 19.50 a.m.
" Moi!" said the brain to the brain - the world's first " telematical" message passed through the web.
The scientific publication PLoS ONE has published an article that says that the international research group has been the first to succeed in conveying the message directly to the mind.
The first messages that sent through the system were "ho" and "ciao", i.e. Spanish and Italian "moi".
Under the pilot arrangement, the electric brain of the sending agent was monitored.
The sender was trained by the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of hand or foot.
The design of the leg movement was interpreted as zero, and moving hands to number one.
This bit-coded data was sent via the web to the recipient agent.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation to detect light emitted for each bit coded as one per bit.
The recipient was taught to interpret the flashes as a message.
Researchers admit that this is still the area of research in their children's minds, but believe computerized telecomic communication is routine for the near future of mankind.
Packages - Point - The future of rural future
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening up its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia fought in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, action will be followed by reaction, action countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only bite in the long term.
Iran was led to negotiations on its nuclear programme not until years later.
For decades, the South African Racism was in place, even though trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
sanctions have been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take high- power or military technology to the USSR.
Russia itself has put obstacles to trade on the world page.
Last time, the wood trade was frozen.
It is clear that forced Russia not to get on their knees.
The Russians have become used to bad times, and Viola's disappearance from the store will not cause panic.
When the EU intends to ban vodka imports from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians will drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French will be allowed to export air carriers to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The current from Russia to Germany continues.
The main disadvantage for Russia is not to end imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
The most damaging factor is the fiscal constraints of the financial sector.
They will only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on international loan markets.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has enormous foreign reserves, they too cannot last forever.
The availability of credit for Russian companies is slowing down and the money is rising.
The own banks are unable to finance all of them.
You have to weigh more money, or you'll have to pay more money for companies.
Competitions are also competitors in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russian modernisation will stop, as the Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in Helsinki Sanoma.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Consequently, Russia returned again to Russia, and its way in the front.

Corrupting corruption at more precise causes of corruption is more accurate.
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by the OECD as well as by the Council of Europe, since the world is astonished by the lowness of bribes and fines in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice working group will consider whether or not the criminal law would be necessary for the purpose of trade and misuse of power.
The differences in legislation arose, for example in the case of Patria's divorce case in Hämeenlinna a year ago, in the case of the Slovenian branch of Patria.
In Slovenia, trade in power brought the former Prime Minister of the two-year penitentiary, but Finland's law does not know the corresponding title.
The network of cooperation against corruption has consolidated its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the newly completed map, donation is hardly studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the Police College on corruption in various fields.

"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players at ACL for us," says Popovic.
In China, Tomi Juric was subjected to a game ban from this gesture.
It's a setback, no players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been hurt.
Whoever's gonna be there, he must have done a lot of work, and I trust the whole team.

He's been practicing a couple of times outside, which is good.
It'll be a while before he's perfectly fine, but he'll be fine.

01.09.2014 21:18 North Korea can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if it happens to be part of the country's elite.
The financial Times are about to tear off the opposites from the economy.
In North Korea, the informal markets may flourish more than ever.
They offer luxury for wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens who have not been used to connecting themselves with the dictatorship state.
Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: an entertainment centre where only a ticket will pay up to 10 months of normal working wage.

Ormisto House: Stormont's Council wishes for sales to the Council of Stormont's hope for sales.
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it has found a buyer in Ormisto House, Belfast, a building that paid taxpayers nearly 3 000 pounds a week.
The Council bought a building in the eastern part of the city of the 19th century 13 years ago and paid nine million pounds of it.
The Council was unable to sell the building further, when the safety and maintenance of the building came to the Council to pay about 400 pounds a day.
The building was sold up to $1.25 million a year.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a category B building with 9 million pounds in 2001, which had to provide historical value, because it needed more office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the building was bought, it was resold at the price of 2.5 million pounds this time.
The building was not sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt of the Ulster Union Party suggested that Ormiston House be agreed with the new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate broker remain silent about the identity and price of the buyer.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormisto House are about 3 000 pounds.
The Council bought a building from the police forces that promoted Northern Ireland Police Board.
By the beginning of this year, the safety costs of Ormisto House were totalling 885 641 pounds and service costs 371 379 pounds.
The price of professional services related to repair and maintenance was 250 015 pounds and the fees of development and design professionals were 212 466 pounds.
The building was previously owned by Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by William Pirrie, a partner of Harland, who later became president of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirrie died, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building and sold it to Campbell College in 1928, which held it in its possession until mid-70s.
"Erquality increases": Helsinki is going to reduce school access providers. Helsinki plans to reduce school access providers. Helsinki is planning to reduce school access providers.
No savings are born, claims to be JHL.
In Helsinki, a radical reduction in the number of school students is being prepared.
The reduction would not concern the child's personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki Board of Education decided to present a total of around 2.7 million cuts in the resources of school-seekers.
In Helsinki, there are around 600 school carers in total.
If the reductions take effect, they shall enter into force in the middle of the academic period as from the beginning of the year.
According to the Association of Trade Unions, the decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunate for the beneficiaries to be reduced from savings, since the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in law.
There is no guarantee that savings will be created, rather than the increase in the labour burden of the staff.
School savings are at an increased risk of falling from learning goals and the ability of teachers to cope with hard work, stressing the importance of JH’s industry director, Päivi Niemi-Laine, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The plans of the City of Helsinki are neutralized by schools, as students who need support from future resources will no longer receive assistant resources at all.
The aim of the City of Helsinki is to prevent exclusion.
The cost-effective work is being carried out by school-based support workers.
However, the Agency’s adjustment measures are aimed at the majority of this group.
This will be the case for all parties involved in the future.
In autumn, the City Council of Helsinki, to which I hope and wisdom to look far beyond the future and to act in accordance with its objectives, notes Niemi-Laine.
Israel will rule over the land of the West Bank.
Israeli women walk in a Jewish settlement in Etzion, near Bethlehem, in the district of Etzion.
On Sunday, Israel occupied nearly 400 acres of land in the West Bank near Bethlehem. This could be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, while it threatened the Palestinians’ request not to build more settlements and the general opinion of the world.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposed the expansion of the West Bank institutions, felt that Sunday events could have been the largest single country in the West Bank's territory for decades, and could "develop dramatically the situation in the region".
The aim of the Palestinians is to set up their own country for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, a political effort to assess the situation in the rural areas came after three Israeli young people were kidnapped and killed in June after they got hit in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested the Palestinian, accused of kidnappings and killings as the main factor in which they were killed.
The timing of land takeover implies that it was intended to be a kind of compensation for the population of the population and punishment for the Palestinians.
In the area of Etzion, near the Jewish Gevaot, the territory of South Jerusalem is now officially declared "country of the state" when it was previously owned by the Palestinians. This was a necessary step in order to allow Israel to start planning buildings in the region if they wish to wish to do so.
However, Ahmad Lafi, mayor of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian Official News Office WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff had published early Sunday provisions that Israel announced that they would take over Surif and nearby villages from countries containing olive and other trees grown by Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections should be raised within 45 days.
The kidnapping of the young people led Israel's army to conduct on the West Bank a fine punishment against Hamas, which Israel says was behind kidnappings in Gaza.
The following tensions at the border between Israel and Gaza reached a 50-day war that ended last week at the ceasefire that was brought by Egypt.
The land occupation has quickly attracted the attention of the Israelis to the West Bank, and has revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government, which hinder the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
The crisis communities in Lapland are usually multi-disdistric problems with a number of problems with their many problems.
The majority of the municipalities of Lapland are in trouble, due to the knowledge research conducted by the University of Lapland and the University of Applied Sciences of Lapland.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of the crisis.
According to the professor, the reduction in municipal tasks of EUR 1 billion is not enough.
The common features of the crisis include weak municipal economy, poor employment and migration losses.
According to Professor Asko Suikkanen, the Emeritus Professor of Emeritus of Sociology at the University of Lappi, new crises are coming from the western border and from East Lapp.
In the survey of the survey, the residents were very realistic in assessing the situation in their condition.
The people of the municipalities who were well-managed were even pessimist in their eyes.
Low expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the current everyday life and well-being will be maintained, perhaps even slightly improved.
In this time it is not dare to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The study group surprised the great differences between municipalities.
For example, income allowances per capita vary from two to ten to more than 100 euros.
The tax revenues received by the municipality per capita vary from two thousand euros to 4400 euros from the Ranua route.
According to the scales, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is used to obtain state shares and what is the degree of debt, the difference between the same situations in each of the same situations, he says.

Bob Carr rejoices for the immediate release of the Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from the Liyala prison of Liberia.
Melinda Taylor, a Australian lawyer, is expected to be released from the Liberian prison today.
The federal government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that "all is going well" and the International Criminal Court's attorney will be released for the Australian authorities tonight, and then he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are delighted with the news that he is likely to be released today", the representative commented to the AAP News Office on New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanked the wider international community for their assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before the journey continued to his home in The Hague.
On 7 June in the city of Zintani, his three co-counsels were arrested by Taylor and three of his court-mar Maammar Gaddafi, the son of Seif al-Islam, former Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor brought to Seif some papers that they thought threatened national security.
Senator Carr has been in a lot of trouble to free Taylor. He, among other things, traveled to the capital of Libya in the last month to drive this thing forward.
Taylor couldn't talk to her husband or her little daughter until the last week.
Senator Carr says Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in The Hague shortly after the visit by the Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with Taylor's parents, John and Janelle, who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally finally given a phone call.
Taylor's parents had been calling to release Libya's daughter before this little baby's third birthday in July.
The three other arresting judicial officers are Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr told me a week ago that following a debate between a lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, "the criminal lawyer was sorry and apologized for a possible misunderstanding".
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of any errors, but has promised to examine in depth the actions of its team once its members returned home.
"In the end of its investigation, the International Criminal Court will ensure that everyone who has acted wrong will be brought to justice", the Court announced in its notice last month.
The International Criminal Court is calling for a trial on a 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's administrative term, which was suddenly terminated last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and, on 1 May, he took the initiative in which he announced that he would not accept the decision of the Judge-Rapporteur of the Court of Justice to hold the case in The Hague.
A young incomeman saved Barcelona - ESS.fi.
Barcelona took his second victory at the early stages of the Spanish football league, but easily did not fall at the home of Villarreal.
The blue tossing head of the Villarreal guard Sergio's Basin until the 82th minute finally succeeded.
The victory was made by a surprising man: 19-year-old, a 19-year-old, first-old who attacked Sandro Ramirez in La Liga had arrived at the field only 12 minutes earlier.

The collections to the Ferguson Police Police ended mysteriously after a $ 4333,000 a $433,000 thousand over the 4333,000 thousand and over $433,000, after a mysteriously over $ 4333,000 000.
Administrators closed two online collection sites without an explanation this weekend of the sites collected by over $400,000 for a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri State.
To the general public on the GoFundMe award site, two separate pages were collected on the same names as "Support Officer Darren Wilson" and "Support Officer Wilson" have been collected for 235 $ 750 and 197 $620 for the Ferguson police who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site operated by Brown's family lawyer had collected $314 099 after Sunday afternoon.
The shooting resulted in many weeks of restlessness and a demonstration mostly against the almost white police forces of the Blacks, which forced Wilson to hide while in local and federal investigations, he was trying to determine whether he shot Brown without cause.
The collection campaigns on the network have caused some concern about the defence of Wilson, especially since some visitors had written a comment on racist comments that have been removed since then.
Both pages apparently stopped receiving donations mostly at the same time on Saturday, and the site administrators did not give cause for it.
When trying to make a donation on the side, he sees a message saying, "The gifts are no longer accepted.
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe gave a notice to the Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented any donation from being made.
"Every organiser of the GoFundMe campaign will decide for himself when to cease receiving donations", Kelsea Little, representative of the GoFundMe website, said in his information.
The organisers may also, if they so wish, continue receiving donations later.
The "Sport Official Wilson" page, with a return of $19,620, maintains a charity team consisting of St. Louis's police officers, Shield of Hope, who is the recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
Three police officers named Joseph Eagle, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda as official representatives of the Land Collection Register of the Land of Hope did not respond immediately on Sunday to e-mails asking for more information about the collection campaign.
Zoll is the official editor of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagle is a member of the Florissant City Council and a member of Roorda Missour's representative building.
The Times also failed to immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Support Officer Darren Wilson" page, who uses the name "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750. He has not been confirmed as the recipient of the donations to be accepted on the site.
However, the representative of the GoFundMe assured in his communication to The Times that an anonymous good element exists.
Only limited information has been provided to donors about the anonymous good of the collection campaign, unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
Two weeks ago, the author of the website wrote to the visitors that the page cooperates with the Shield of Hope group in order to become an officially accepted recipient of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The author provided additional information to those wishing to wish to have a registered Gmail email address, but did not respond immediately on Sundays request for more information.
In his communication to The Times, the representative of the GoFundMe said that the anonymous collection page has been deleted from the main site search results and added that "this campaign will no longer meet the requirements of the GoFundMe website for running a Facebook account".
In the information safety practices of the GoFundMe site, users are invited to "deliver only the GoFundMe users who they know personally and to whom they trust".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection website published on GoFundMe is accurate and honest.
However, according to President Litva, GoFundMe has been "in connection with the campaign organiser, and there is no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to arrest all the funds collected if it is necessary to initiate investigations in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve the funds collected by this campaign.
The popular Facebook page "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised campaigns supporting Wilson, told its followers this weekend that lawyers are trying to find "explicit" why donors on GoFundMe have been prevented from giving up, but the page did not provide any further information.
Also on the website there is an anonymous administrator, and an independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
