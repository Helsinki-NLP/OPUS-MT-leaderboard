I have plenty of time for fun.

I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.

I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mom home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt he has access to it.
This affects everyone.
It's not over until we're done with it.
I'll take your place.
I go to work on a train every day.
I spoke to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
Better with your sister.
It comes with love that I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
There could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all the work being done.
He's obviously freaked out.
He didn't break.
I wasn't wrong.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
It didn't stop snowing.
I don't care if you're coming.
There's nothing to do with it.
No matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
It doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like they were pouring it on me.
I soon realized I misunderstood him.
It was snowing the previous day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
That's exactly what happened on the day of our marriage, honey.
There had to be a reason for this to happen.
Suddenly, it happened.
That was when he was outside.
He happened to me several times.
Sometimes it happens.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should be dieting.
I think everyone's hungry.
I think he can't help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think he dropped some of the film bags.
I think I can do it.
I wouldn't be able to kill you.
I don't think I could kill him.
I think I don't understand.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I feel like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's true.
It's a very small probability, I think you're gonna do that on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think that's true.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
I think you better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor may have died.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I think there's someone in the door.
I think something's not right.
I find the spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think you should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'll think about it, so I'll drink.
I'm thinking, so I'm real.
I don't think it makes sense to try to convince him.
I think you did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I believe that time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.
I think Tomi's agitating.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more than that.
I think Tamás wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom's gonna be able to help.
I think Tamás wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we should be patient.
I think we turned the wrong way somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all a bunch of screws right now.
I think you called the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what his name is.
I think you'll approve it.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood me.
I think you should go inside in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you have a great job to do.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't very convincing.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat somewhere, it would cheer you up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought I was gonna blow my head off.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the feet, but it didn't prove it.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
It hurts.
That hurts.
I'm under his influence.
It really impressed me.
This is dangerous.
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what it was about.
It's hard for everyone to get in the mood.
It's hard for everyone to get in the mood.
I have doubts whether it's gonna work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It is high time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
It's wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's not too late to study.
Good to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector cannot be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
This is not the right solution.
It's not too much to say that he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It doesn't work.
He may be lying.
It doesn't suit your mouth.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Oh, it's really bad today.
You son of a bitch.
It's 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's a very easy task for him.
It's on you.
It's useful information.
There's a lot of heat in the night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after you change your baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's gonna be dangerous.
It'll be dark before we get home.
He'll be ready when he's ready.
He'll be ready when he has to.
It'll take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He's gonna knock off soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
As a result, it looks bigger than that.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need to be here.
You could use a shaving.
Looks like you're not feeling well here.
Looks like you were thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
This could be a long time.
Maybe it's a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd like to try it.
Maybe I'll be late.
You have to wash it.
He has to report something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
You have to fix it.
There never existed.
It never should have happened.
Even though I lied to her that I didn't want to.
I told him I was doing the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you I'm okay.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question for you, too.
I used to bathe a long time.
I've been in the tub a long time.
I've arranged it.
That's 58. I'm on my way.
I was sure you were on our side.
Yesterday I took my cat to the zoo.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It would probably be cheaper anywhere else.
The rain broke in the morning before yesterday.
It was yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I work two hours a day.
I traveled all over Russia.
I've been travelling to the United States a lot.
It actually works.
It's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep him alive.
I tried to stop him.
I was trying to help Tomi.
I'd trust my life.
I'm trying to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
He's a big cat.
It's a little early for drinking, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, at least on paper.
A gray stone building.
This is a housekeeper dog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's completely dark out there.
It's all mine.
It's all right, it's over.
That's nice and good theory, but will this work out in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's 7 o'clock.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 in the morning.
One of my fathers was always living near a river.
Always the same bitch.
Environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a dirty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame.
It's a shame I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a big weirdo.
It's a nightmare.
It's freezing cold.
This is just as much art as science.
This is from the past.
She's in school.
Very dangerous sport, where a minor error can lead to serious injury.
It's an old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It was crazy.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's too late for that day.
It's a tough day.
It's happened before.
It wasn't as long as it was.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
It's a good night for the garden to whisper.
It's a fire drill.
Oh, my God.
It's cheap to get on a bus.
That's Chinese for me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed every Sunday.
Closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold.
It's cold out there.
It's cold.
It's known the bear loves honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
It's totally normal.
All right, all right.
It's dangerous here.
Deep down here.
This is really good.
It's done.
It's easier not to start than stop.
It's a long way to be brave.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like a eternity to me.
It seemed the bus was late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like only yesterday we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks really weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
It seems to me you're honest.
It seems like you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's awkward to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
My dear.
It's fair when they get the same salary for the same job.
It's not even perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's getting crazy.
He's becoming a comedy.
We're going to have a tough time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see the ammo stars.
It's good to be gay.
It's good to learn.
I'm glad you could make it.
That's great, you're gonna laugh.
It's not hard to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe that all this time was clean and sunny.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town where you can sleep.
It's hard to say words.
It's hard to express words.
It's hard to steal a thief.
She's very nice.
He's got a big head.
High.
Children already have their place in bed.
Stop talking about the money.
Tonight it's hotter than usual.
This is illegal.
This is important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when giving birth to a child.
It's important that we help them get into trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
Inability to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to meet your conditions.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
This is inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just move over.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
It's so nice of you to say that.
It's late.
Today we have laundry.
It's like a sub-field, and the turtles, they're all over them and sharks, like flying creatures.
This is closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me.
That's me.
It's pathetic the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life.
This is my life.
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's not too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
It's not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as dazzling as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This won't happen.
You're not going to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
Not negile.
It's not that far away.
It's not that simple.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you're doing, it's how you do it.
It's not worth fighting for him.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't say anything to you.
I didn't tell you.
You have no reason to confess to the priest if you do not testify to sin.
There's no point in being in the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's clearly impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's not a problem if some people think they're a farmer.
It's okay if you're gay.
— Three months have passed, and Tomi already says that he speaks French liquidly. — Well, yes, it's on the top of the stupid gene. — The Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
He's on the other side of the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's like I'm pouring it out of honey.
He opened his wings.
It's amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's quite simple.
It is clear that the purpose of these mysandrop theories is manifest in the assessment of the working class, thereby removing imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars that he has feared, and in the fact that he believes the core of the thought, that man’s associated aggressive tendencies are the causes of endless wars.
It's urgent.
It rains in my heart.
A small large garden is located in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big song.
That's where it is.
It's impeccable to ask someone how much he's making.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they'll leave Tokyo soon enough.
Shit.
It's disgusting.
It's snowing here.
Boston is snowing.
It's so good to stay home.
It's still moving.
It's suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
This is the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You have to answer that question.
It's time we picked up our tent tree.
Time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time.
It's time to fix the problem.
I should cut off my hair.
It's time to relax.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It is high time we did something about this.
Tom has his birthday today.
That's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word is against Maria's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
That's very precious to me.
It's too hot for this.
You're gonna have to be late for a while.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn time.
It's a bad thing to get cold.

The story started.
I've been having fun.
Almost hit a car.
I was a hell of a nervous person.
I was nervous at first, but then I gradually calmed down.

I was worried you might leave me.
I was sick, I stayed home all day.
I was singing.
I sat on a chair in Bern at the patent office when I suddenly came up with an idea: if a man goes free, he doesn't feel his own weight, which upsets me, and he led me to this gravitational theory.
I was sitting next to Tomi.
I couldn't say anything.
I stood by him.
I was still at home.
I've been in the plug for 30 minutes this afternoon.
I was surprised by what I found out.

I wish you'd done that early in the morning.
I wish you'd let Tom finish his story.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
I wish you wouldn't do that right now.
I woke up.
I'm tired of waking up.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
I was wondering if others were as wondering as much as I am.
I'm wondering how I can do it better.
How much that could cost?
I wonder how this works.
Is time clear tomorrow?
Is she married?
Is there any easier way to do this?

I wonder if Tom will be here tomorrow.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
What did the painter want to say to that effect?

Who could have put this here?
Who can be responsible?
Why would he ask you that?
What's that so expensive?
I want to know why Tomi didn't come to Mari's party.
I won.
I won't be home today.
