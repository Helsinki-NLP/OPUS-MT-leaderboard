Eemel Koukii led Hurrican's home victory in the opening to the second victory for Savo Volley Savo Volley.
On a seven-time period, Hurricane-Loimaa, which had been on the men's volleyball medals, started the 2018-19 domestic victory, when Raision Lomu fell from 3 to 0 on Saturday.
Emeli Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the most effective player in Hurrican at 22 points.
There were a few rounds abroad, but they didn't come true, and then the call came from Loimaa.
We got a quick deal, Kouki said.
Like anyone in Lompoo, Tomi Rumpunen's support was Koukia at 18 points.
The most effective visitors were by match-by-off agreement with the country team leader Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
The winning of the key game is always important.
A number of players had experience with their opponents, and it brought extra extra extra extra extra for the game.
We are not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal tube is, of course, a goal, Kouki said.
Määänen Savo Volley's most powerful Savo Volley's most powerful ever.
Miro Määtänen was 18 points Savo Volley's most effective when the team ran off next to Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
We were agitated, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately we got a bit of a win.
At least I didn't have any idea of a different download when I played against my former team, Mätänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in 2000-01 at the next airport, scored 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuavinen was satisfied with a number of things.
The hall was a small or mood in the roof all the time.
The good guy was left out of the opening.
Miro was a king, and he was playing a good game, and he said, "He's a good game."
The previous season was 2006-07, when she won silver in Pielaveden Sammo when Tuyinen was still head coach.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks's most effective 14 points.
Miknen again from the Star Star of Aka-Lover.
In the period 2012-13, the won by Joni Mikkonen, who won the league score, has started this period very strongly.
The hacker made 25 points when Aka-Volley took the season's opening profit after he took over Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
Your period has started quite well for yourself.
Today, of course, there was a defeat close to that, because we were four at 17-21.
Well, we were digging out some kind of assembly victory, and that was the same thing as Miknen's fifth round.
A few months ago, the most effective of the tigers in the final match was 28 points made by the hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Maanman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported 17 points.
I didn't get a little bit of a shot at the guy's hat, Mikken's complimented me.
Compared to human capital, the world’s first priority is the comparison between human capital and human capital.
Finland is at the head of the world in comparison with human capital, reports the journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years, Finland was one of Statistics.
In 2016, the top set was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland followed Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later the Netherlands was placed one higher and instead of Canada there was Taiwan found on the list instead of Taiwan.
In 2016 the lowest comparison was made between Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, consideration shall be given to the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has focused human capital on economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois held Athletico, the local game ended with an unspoiled goal.
Real Madrid goalist Thibaut Courtois stretched a lot of great fighting, and the local game of the Madrid Teams ended with a goalless tie in the late Saturday at the Spanish football league.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but Belgian minister Courtois was able to fight against it.
Courtois played at Athletico three times with a loan nest while he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, Fifa selected him as the goalkeeper for the year.
In Real, the best destination was Gareth Bale, but his shot was passed by at the end of the open end of the finish of the goal.
Bale was replaced after the break because of the passenger injury.
According to ESPN, the disappointments of Real called out in the fight for the title of the paint job that moved to Jutus by the name of Cristiano Ronaldo.
In the United States, we are now being attacked against abortion law - a powerful document tells us why.
The United States Senate is currently trying to see if one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could choose the candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, by President Donald Trump.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive vote of Kavanaugh would be a decision known as Roe versus Wade, which was made by an abortion law in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Converting Roe - United States and abortion rights tell us how the current situation has occurred over the years.
As incredible as it seems, the topic is also current in Finland.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done publicity work against a safe abortion and received various levels of support from the majority of the peoples of our country.
At the beginning of a powerful document, a gynecologist, Colleen McNicholas, who has remained the only doctor who has had abortions in Missouri, the state of Missour.
The clinic's armed guard tells us that he defends U.S. religious freedom.
News videos remind me of the deadly terrorist attacks committed to the clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Church Association guided women to reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the interviewed pastor are good, but in fact they are not even necessary, a picture of the woman who died of an abortion himself is enough.
The death rate in the United States was about 5000 per year.
In particular, the Republican Party defended the legalisation of abortions.
Already in 1967, in California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, specifically in Reagan, the presidential campaign in 1980, it began to reverse the fact that religion was mixed up with policy voters to hold hold hands.
Her abortion was also passed out by her successor, George Bush's parent.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document of the deeper core of this issue is based on the policy of abortion.
When tax exemptions were prohibited from religious organisations that support racial discrimination, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a "super horse".
Religion has brought policy in exceptional nodes.
This is the case in the United States where the vote of religious justice in its abortions has been chosen by the President as the highest right candidate, Kavanaugh, which is now accused of sexual harassment by several women.
Kavanaugh may be given the authority based on an office based on an office based on an office based on a language station to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The army of Israel shot seven Palestinians, including two children - at the border of the border great protests.
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year after Israel has set fire to protestors in the border zone.
The Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone on Friday, reports the Palestinian Health Department.
According to the Palestinian Health Department, there are two children: boys aged 12 and 14.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
89 of these were wounded from bullets.
Israel’s army has confirmed that it opened fire and had a blow in the border zone when the protestors threw Israel’s troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has started using force so that the protestors do not break down the border fence or try to try to do so on the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza's demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians began weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Council, 12 000 are wounded.
The speakers demanded access to Palestinian families in areas where the Palestinians had to leave when the state of Israel was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives from the fields and helium balls sent from Palestine have set fire to forest areas and agricultural land in Israel.
Teemu Santa Santa got a penalty kick, couldn't get to shoot himself.
Wigan's top couple, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have poured him out with a cab behind him in the penalty zone.
The divorce judge Gavin Ward allowed the game to continue.
According to his interpretation, the assurance was pure.
Teemu Santa couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was delayed by Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to punishment for 85 minutes when Santa was taken down.
Ward looked like a penalty shot, and Mario Vrancic's hit a 1-0-win-win.
Santa's done five goals for Norwich in the Championship series.
The last one was born on last Saturday against QPR in elegantly with the chest muscles.
The work was good for Santa again.
After the fire was lost, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created goals and defended himself tirelessly.
The match for Norwich was five in two weeks.
The team's going too far.
There's a five-gauge pipe in the back.
The paediatric pedophipop pedophipopopopop pedophip pededi pededi pededi pedophied service was immediately completed in bookings - in Finland about 40 000 people who are interested in children.
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a small proportion of women experience at least a degree of sexual interest in pre-olds.
In Finland, this means about 40 000 people.
Up until now, it has been difficult for children or young sexually interested people to get help.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Care Foundation and the Sexpo Joint Project will train professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was told in the spring, e-mail discussions and therapy offered in Sexpo began, and appointments were made very quickly to complete, Yle says.
However, these are promised to be released in the autumn.
The sexual preference for children creates shame for many.
Most of the pedophile emotions themselves have not done their fantasys or, therefore, did not commit any criminal activity.
However, opinion is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the ideas that upset and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Ylee's sexual therapist, Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a special expert in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if one child is saved by sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Age leaders or a Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may seem strange, but Trump is one of the greatest popular prize winners on the basis of the bets.
The background is that Trump has a role to play in obtaining North Korea, at least at the level of speech, to commit itself to the nuclear crisis.
The biggest favorites of peace for the Nobel recipients are the coefficients given that the President of South Korea, Moon Jae and North Korea, Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming between the ears is significant, since last year the gap between the middle of the gap was high.
Yet for many years, the reward for Kim, which leads to a nuclear threat and iron grip from his country, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
Nobel Prize winners will be published from Monday to Friday, and the peace prize for which most attention is held on Friday.
If the award is not awarded to those taking part in the degree of diplomacy in Korea, there is one top-level Congolese doctor, Denise Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has been treating thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo and who have become a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has been working on paying attention to sexual violence, which is a horrific by-product of many conflicts.
The strong candidate was also considered the UN Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has told us that, this year, there are 331 candidates who receive the prize.
No nominations are made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel could get it.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it, Trump said smiling.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued by referring to the North Korea negotiations.
However, there are factors that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing Liberian democracy and a diverse world order - precisely the kind of international cooperation that Trump has seen in opposition to the Trump.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded by three US politicians, all of which have been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
The award of the Trump would, therefore, require the Nobel Committee to make a full exchange of ideas.
Fire notice in the tunnel: Car drivers behaved like warriors and drove the wrong direction in the wrong direction.
On 8 September, the traffic report on the One-One-Sniper Dragon took place on 8 September.
Due to the notification, traffic in the tunnel was interrupted both in the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a system failure, the fire department was trying to make transport normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it could not be opened, because there are drivers on the road with a skank of the skank and they're driving how it hurts, the main firefighter Pasi Kõräinen told the latest STT at that time.
At that time, the motorway was started to drive even in the wrong direction just after waiting for a moment.
When the first start starts to act against traffic regulations, some others often follow after, Chief of Transport Security Tapio Heiskanen is amazed by the fact that the main problem is that there are some of them.
According to the rules of transport, motor roads and tunnels must not stop as an overriding reason.
Transport security reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to leave to put traffic at risk by emergency solutions.
Emergency vehicles shall always be allowed as far as possible to walk as possible.
In particular, it is prohibited to drive in the opposite direction on the motorway, as well as to make and withdraw the U-turn.
The same prohibitions are also valid in tunnels where the headlamps must always be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop without a compelling reason, as, of course, parking as well as parking.
There have been even cases since then where the driver has stopped to the tunnel to brush snow on his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for this operation, Heiskanen says in the Transport Security Information.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party even though the ship was caught on the lake bottom.
The Ilves fans carried by M/S Tampere would have liked to remain on board the ship to continue their victory party, even though the ship had been caught by the lake bottom, reports Juho Syrj, who was the ship's master at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on his way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drove late on Saturday night off the road and got stuck in the bottom of the old water in Aka.
Nineteen passengers on board and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the pals.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their party on the boat until morning, but of course it was better to send them to the firehouse by boat to the port and by bus home, Syrja said to STT.
Ilves fans had been to Hämeenlinna following Ilves and HPK, which ended with Ilves 4-3 winners.
According to the frequency, Saturday's buddy was due to the fact that the surface of the water was about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrvi, navigation was also made difficult by the fact that the nearest route mark was covered by blocks, which is why its reflectors were not normally seen in the dark bay.
No more mention of a collision.
The haver occurred shortly on the west side of the narrow Jumusessalmi after the boat route had taken over the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki motorways.
The greater drama of the case was not according to the Syrrä, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the event and the failure of the base caused a more significant collision.
According to the seal, the installation of the base has not caused leaks or heavy losses on the ship, and the cruises of the ship in these visions continue normally.
The diver visited on Saturday morning to check the ship's condition before the ship was towed off the sink.
For the sake of certainty, we're still going to the yard to check that there was no damage, Syrja tells us.
Syrja believes that the next trip to M/S Tampere, which is closed next weekend, can be handled in an appropriate manner.
The cruise season of the vessel continues with him until the day of his independence.
No use for ambulances.
The rescue facility received an alert from the case on Saturday night a little half and a half after twelve.
The port of the visa was alarmed to the Ambulances to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for the Ambulances.
The day-old firefighter Matti Willman told me late at night that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and rather severe wind.
The Pirkanmaa Rescue Department informed half a half after three on Sunday night that everyone on board was evacuated and that passengers have been transferred by bus to Tampere by bus and bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has recovered in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The accused Trump's referee may be in a position to lose a top-level job.
Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court of the United States Supreme Court, may well be deprived of his or her mandate, assessing the Director General Mika Aaltola at the Foreign Policy Institute.
To date, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to Aalto, doubts have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up in the office of another person.
In the United States, at times, it has happened in the past that the presidential candidate for Supreme Court has raised many conflicts.
In that case, the referee has usually taken his own course, says Aalla.
This is how the President has been able to preserve his face.
The name would be 100 cents for the war of the Democrats.
The Supreme Court of the United States is seeking to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a politically highly sensitive process.
If Mr Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltoa, the decision to rain is likely to be in the Chamber of the Democratic Party in the forthcoming elections to Congress.
It would raise the vote among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge for the highest court would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The appointment does not take place every term of office, since the Supreme Court judges in the United States are hereby appointed for life.
In practice, some of them must have retired at their own request from some 70 to 80 years of age.
Even a part of the Republics had doubts about the name.
The Supreme Court of the United States Court of Justice has a normal background report, says Aaltola.
Although Trump has set the FBI's additional investigation for only a week, it can still say that Aaltoa has something to do with it.
I think it could bring you something.
There's rarely smoke without fire, says Aaltoa.
According to Aalto, at least it is certain that Kavanaugh's suitability or inefficiencies are still being discussed carefully before the Senate takes its decision.
The Republics in the Senate have a majority of 51-49 votes, but at least two female Republican Republican leaders believe that Kavanaugh's appointment is suspicious.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be taken to the vote and the Republicans would be lost.
A woman identified a woman as an agent for Salisbury's armed military intelligence intelligence as an agent for Salalisbury.
The Russian woman has told BBC that she recognized Salisbury as an agent for the Russian military intelligence service of the suspected Russian leader for poisoning.
Based on photographs, she told me that this is military intelligence with Anatoly Tshepi, who works in GRU.
Net Community Bellingcat and the Russian Community Insider Russia said earlier that they had revealed another of the poisons from the suspected men into Cheepiga.
Previously they said that they had found evidence that the present identity of men is covert personnel.
The BBC group traveled from the Far East to a village near the border between Russia and China where the Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in a village identified the photos published by young Cheepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from the pictures of the British police in which Ruslan Boshiro was a man now calling himself himself.
Russian men are suspected of being poisoned by former double agent Sergei Scripal and his daughter in March with Novishok nerve poison.
The Scripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among others, with the honour mark of the Russian hero in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GRU connection.
The men suspected of poisoning reported earlier in September that they were tourists in Salisbury, Russia's interview with TV in September.
Old throwing bags in a war reform process.
A living example has now been given of what is practically meant by the change of the social reform as defined by the Sipilä Government.
My son-in-law Vaala's social services are produced by the municipality of Oulu, whose former Regional Director of Addindo was elected Health Service Director in 2016.
The heads of the team are warning the delegation of the change limiter.
If the war expenditure is now rising, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The central heads of the municipality were scared, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would end the health centre’s bed department for institutional care and a small unit for memory patients.
Domestic care would be increased, which means long distances in Vaala, that elderly people living in remote villages would be torn from their roots to be treated as a home next to a health centre.
Annado trusted the municipality to pay it to its customers.
The left of the whales did not miss poor preparation, but organised a public meeting with a large number of family members, close-ups, as well as delegates from other parties.
I presented the social media industry on the basis of how the municipality of Vaala is managing the elderly most at home already at home in the whole North Ostrobothnia.
There was also a local councilman from the West of Carina.
The newspaper made a big deal about the occasion, and it again raised the manufacturers of the Oulun Islands to their rear legs.
Sote manufacturers do not write any papers about the fact that Intendo has built a new care home in Vaala, which is now waiting for the empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers only talk about service notes, but do not tell us what level of treatment it receives or what type of staff structure Intendo will be able to deal with older people up to escort treatment.
Without a nurse?
The establishments of the health centre will be terminated because they do not have a doctor’s overnight stay.
Mr Annando will be a member of the public health centre's doctors.
The example of the whale shows how central officials run authorised officials on incomplete data and the authorised person points back against the wall with a change limitation device.
In this way, the Central Party will clear the inhabitants of Vaala, because who will remain safe to live on a voluntary basis if there is an opportunity to move away from it.
Was there, in the centre, a single referendum that the whole country was considered inhabited?
President Erdogan, President of Turkey Erdogan opened the Grand Space Commander in Cologne.
In the city of Cologne, thousands of people found their minds when Turkish President Recep Tayyyip Erdogan opened up the largest Muslim in Europe.
Several hundreds of people had been gathered by the Rhine River since the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the sign of the protestors, and Fascism was condemned in the attacks.
A number of demonstrations have been organised during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and security measures have been tight.
Some 10,000 people were expected to protest, including the human rights situation in Turkey, on the streets.
There had also been a gathering of Erdogan's supporters nearby.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the Muslim environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdoga said that his visit to Germany had been successful and considered that it had confirmed the relationship between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday that they would rebuild relations between countries, which have deteriorated significantly since the Turkish coup of 2016.
However, it has been pointed out that there are serious differences between countries, including with regard to human rights issues.
Review About Visiting
Both the Governor of Cologne Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet withdrew their participation when the review of Erdogan's visit was accelerated.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, told us that he had come to an anti- Erdogan demonstration against Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subjected.
For Erdogan, everything that departs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last stage of Erdogan’s German trip to North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish-based.
In Slovakia, three accusations of the murder of the supplier in Slovakia three accusations of the murder of the supplier.
In Slovakia three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor told me on Friday that three people are being charged with the murder of Kucik and this fiancée and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kucak was found shot in February with his fiancée in his home in Bratislava.
He had examined the contacts between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
The police have suspected the murder-related murder-related investigation into the Kuccan case.
The case and the article published by Kucia have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.

Due to the error in the result, the Sunday Shepherd will also have to be posted as an addressless.
This may be seen in the distribution of the magazine in decentralised areas where distribution in joint boxes is to be carried out by external memory.
The situation was the same for the Saturday magazine, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post will put extra leaves in the province.
The magazines of other Finnish subscribers will only be posted separately on Mondays only.
The distribution of these magazines will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Editor Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heila today in his forthcoming discussion programme.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about his future space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactica in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which required bank loans to be paid.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year after year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky flight of chance and death in 2014, things are going to be going down the road.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or not later than next year.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that his journey will take about the end of the year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and the weightless condition is 5 minutes at 100 kilometers, the Finnish astronaut tells us about his future homepage.
At the same address, he also wants to see the background in space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic page about space travel and saw the Star Trek series on television.
The stars have been seen, and that's what made the idea come true...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a harsh host.
Manchester City continued its lossless course in Valioliiga, when it poured out its way home on Saturday at Brighton County 2-0.
The sixth victory of the Governing Master Team is guaranteed by goal syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to guide him from his fourth hit to an empty finish when Leroy Sanné found him 30 minutes ago at Brighton goal bottom.
Agüero raised his own goalboard to five when he saw Sterling and the Brighton defense to pieces with 65th game news.
The Argentinan was able to place the 2-0-deployed penalty blows in a easy way.
With six wins and one equal season started by City leading Valioliga to 19 points at the catch level.
One match less played by Liverpool, however, only one point at the end of the game.
Liverpool points on Saturday night in his own seventh round match in the series-three Chelsea.
Youth youth clubs chose new decision-makers in Joensuu.
At its meeting on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Associations selected new decision-makers for the next three years 2019-2021.
The president was elected to Mr Anu Sivonen from Ylä-Savo and vice-president Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.

Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and amazed Ferrari: "He's going a very important driver".
In the Swiss magazine Blick's interview with the Britishman Mersu, he believed that the liberalisation of Kimi Räikkösen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the end of the period.
Hamilton's lead at MM points is Ferrari's other driver Sebastian Vettä at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable for the next period and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't believe that Räikkönen would hit gloves in the dishes.
I don't think Kim's gonna change in any of the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorites and I am convinced that Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his premieres.
I don't know if Kim knows this, but when I was young and I had a dream form in number one, I played a F1 game with PlayItalianLott every day every day.
I was always Kimi, which is kind of crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 period will continue on Sunday at the Russian share contest.
The contest begins at 14 o'clock at the site leaves the Mercedes Vallter Bottas.
The evening magazine will be watching the race for a moment.
The championship campaign of the A-Yourten SM series football team became a full farce: the opponent arrived only with the power of 7 players.
The top series of football boys ends on Saturday, when the final round of the season is played.
The starting point of the round from the point of view of the championship campaign was clear: FC Lahti Akadeemia will have enough time for a single strike against the left IFK in practice.
In order to change the situation during the last round, Ilveus, who is the second in the championship campaign, has to win PK-35 and hope for the defeat of the Lahanks.
However, in practice, even before the start of the kickoff, the Lahava ICK had arrived at only seven players' power.
If it had been one less, the match could not have been started.
The FC Lahti Academy won the 16-0 match.
In the break, the laymen led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the Vass players’ balance is that the team has played part in the same players in the A-Youten SM series, the P20 series and the men’s second-line C-section.
Left IFK has played in second practice against the fall of the entire season.
During the final round of the second round, the Vasa IFK will have to win JBK in a guest match while hoping that Tampere United will lose its own guest match against KuFua in Siilijärvi Toivala.
The car ended with the missing Enos, the rescue unit says that the fortune was involved in the project.
The car got out of the way and ended up on Eno's Street at 9 a.m. on Sunday night.
Four people were involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue unit is informing them.
Good luck, we'll find out.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet from the rain.
The police department visited the scene of the accident.
Supo looks forward to new ways to request: Equipment procurement and recruitment are not slowing down on foreign planning abroad.

Serena Williams is upset by the video she sings in the upper part of her singing in front of her breast cancer information. She's campaigning for information in her breast cancer breast cancer.
Tennis's Star Serena Williams will be again surprised.
Now he's campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video with his Instagram account, where he's just singing hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The picture is a Australian The Divinyls Hit I Touch Myself in 1991.
On video Williams supports Australia's breast cancer association.
"I made The Divinys's global hit to remind women to do regular self-checks on their own", Williams writes in his Instagram-mail.
And yes, this put me in an discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the subject affects all women regardless of the color of the skin around the world.
Early detection is everything a and o - it scares many lives.
The second writer of The Diinyls' song is Chrissy Amphlet, who died of breast cancer five years ago when he was 53 years old.
Music Video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer, but he gave us a blubbery song to remind us of women to put their health first," Williams says.
The video has been watched now for 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is praised for his courage.
Williams left Beijing's tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is in the US open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and claimed, among other things, that men were accepted as far as women's toys are concerned.
The Chinese restaurant on the mountain slope in China is not suitable for high-mämämämämämämäinen.
In addition to traditional Chinese flavors, the restaurant serves great landscapes.
An exceptional restaurant has been opened at the province of Zhejiang in China.
It is literally located in a rock with a tongue.
If you want to look below, you can look at the forest.
The steep landscapes in the heights make restaurant visitors bark their lives in the mountains of Longquan.
To reach the restaurant, it is necessary to walk away from the peach trees in the middle of the peach trees.
The restaurant opened on 19 September 2018.
Youtube comments wonder where the restaurant’s bathroom is located.
A walk to a restaurant requires a good set of ground, from where to tell.

Today, it is so to visit the domestic rural drama Korpela’s flower drink, which has been quite liked.
The third production period is like hot stones: last week the episode looked at the television first performance of 722,000 Finns.
The peaks themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no future for Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkinen.
In the financial period, in relation to the stable and Mirku, we are once again taking on the pursuit of the dream, and I think that the mother of Pacific is the first to guess what I'm going to be going to have to do.
Also, in the light of recent events, the between Anss and Miisa is quite romantic, but then again, in the patterns of Laiho appears again.
The police are also in a suspicious position about a dead man's relationship.
Still, no one knows that Laiho's fate is in advance.
Anita in turn can hear amazing news.
The last will of the distance will come out loud, which will bring a woman's tears upon her.
After a week on Sundays and Sundays, Sorjonen continues to be a new episode.
I'll make a run today at 11 p.m., at 21.05 p.m.
Is it worth going to work tomorrow in a little cold?
This information is for you and you are opposed to these facts and facts.
Flu season's hot.
Many arpoos stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether others should be infected, as the disease may be contagious, even if its own symptoms are small.
The symptoms of flu are sudden attacks, sometimes in mice.
In the latter case, you may be infecting others even if your symptoms are small, says Prevention.
So you should stay home?
According to Prevention, the flu is contagious even when a person does not have any symptoms himself.
The virus is going to take days before the symptoms begin and from then five days to a week.
Children may become more infected with the disease.
As soon as you identify the symptoms, you shouldn't be in school or working.
You can come back to work when coughing up and there's no more fever, says Professor Gregory Poland, professor of medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the gym slows down recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, their noses, and toss the dirty paper into the trash.
Are you still a pain in the ass?
If you have to leave home sick, consider using a protective mask.
The mask does not control viruses, but it keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't have to put your fingers in your nose or mouth, says Poland.
Also, there are limits to fangs with a mask.
How could infected people then be avoided?
The best way to keep your hands off your hands is to avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.

In 2009, he was in the Finnish team at the 18-year-old World Cup.
In the early days, a couple lived in a distant relationship almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the winner's third, and that would make me a career, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship in any way.
Although we would have to live separate, we have good confidence and the good thing about remote relations is that it will remain throughout the whole season, Alina pelted in May.
From continuous growth to joy, death and death in our inter intersts will be the greatest death in us.
Almost everyone is concerned about the global sustainability.
Yet there is still no attempt to give up much.
Sustainable options are being sought for continuous growth, but the theory of a fair economy is also facing major problems.
During a few generations, economic growth has led to ordinary people, especially in the north half of the hemisphere, living standards, of which only dreams could occur before.
However, the long-term excess and climate change of the earth’s bearing capacity make this market economy’s rock foot in a very dangerous way.

Last few days, Lehter has been on the scene for drug abuse.
MTV told me on Wednesday that Lehter is one of 23 suspects in a drug abuse group, where some are suspected of drug use and, for example, part of sales.
The paper has been denying that she committed a crime.
The watch and the player have been discussing the subject, and the NHL will investigate the case.

In the training game, the Lehter was excellent, according to Carchid.
In another one, Lehter was fighting the reel himself under the influence of a defenseman, and then he pulled the defender against him and fed him into the opening place of Rafkel, who was waiting for the paint.
For the second time, co-operation with the twin brought the paint to the end of the match.
Flyers will start the NHL season with a visit to Las Vegas on 4 October.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere ran to the beach in Pyhäjärve - "Supendously shut up with a stone"
Inland ship M/S Tampere drove to the beach late on Friday night at Akakala Holy Lake.
The rescue facility received an alarm of the water traffic accident on Friday night after 12 and beyond.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has drifted onto the bear, and is firmly attached to his neck with a rock, described the sun-friendly firemaster Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers on board and five crew members on board.
According to the insurance institution, personal injury was avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated into the continent from the ship.
They are now being moved to Tampere by bus call, told the head of the e-mail to Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 p.m. at night.
The port of Vienna was alarmed to the Ambulances to receive evaccinated passengers.
For some reason, the ship from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had drifted off its route west of the narrow Jumusesensalmi Jumusesalmi.
The police will find out why things are happening.
The day-old firefighter Matti Willman told me earlier last night that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of darkness and a rather severe wind.
According to the Rescue Authority, the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship apparently doesn't leak.
The divers are going to check the situation at the bottom after the evacuation operation.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently an inland waterway vessel, currently operating as a restaurant, with the maximum permitted number of passengers of 180 persons.
The vessel also has a meeting room to rent for private use.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser has recovered in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

The ex-manageers claim Robert Helenius's unpaid commissions from Robert Helenius.
A boxer Robert Helenius's evening fight against Erkan Teper is a shadow of money.
The evening-Sanomat news today the boxing manager Jaakko Helmis and Vice-President Jussi Kokkilan for a challenge application for a total of EUR 80 000 non-payments from Helenius with late interest rates totalling a total of EUR 80 000.
According to the application, Helsinki and Kokkila worked for Helen on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to settle, but there's no other way.
This has been a clear assignment, and the work has been done very much, and Kokila says to Ilt-Sanom.
Helen's current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to the evening magazine to tell us about the events of the boxer's vision.
Helenus denies being obliged to pay the amount required.
He said that Kokkkila and Helmi had offered their services in an economically inefficient situation to Heleni and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorships for her.
By word it was agreed that Helenius was obliged to pay the commissions only percentages of his matches.
It was truly assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they organised by them.
This is also a normal and unique practice for the management of professional athletes.
It has never been agreed on, and that would have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, Sundman, in the course of his communication.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
In addition, Helenius would have wanted to agree in writing on the distribution of income from the outset, but Kokkkila and Sundman received a draft before the end of 2014.
He stated that the proposal was for its own sake and cut off co-operation with Kokkila and Hellas.
Helen did not once deal with Kokkila and Hellus.
The year after the end of the cooperation, Helen had been shown to have been "unpersonal but massive" invoiced by the manager for his work.
This year, the same arguments have been raised.
Helenius considers the later activities of Helmis and Kokkkila to be poor, in reply it says.
Helenus is meeting today in Erkan Teper Stuttgart, the seventh challenge list of the IBF's heavyweight series.
A hearty man and a good journalist.
The entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Allio knew that he had been a late radio driver and editor Erkki Päll for decades.
Erkki Päll, who was 83 years old, died of unhealed liver cancer.
The death statement of the driver was published on Sunday in the City of Helsinki Sanoma.
The notice shall state the death of Päll on September 3rd.
The tab told me about a serious illness on its Facebook page in March 2018.
At that time, the publication also saw Ile Vainio, which was alarmed by knowledge of what happened to a familiar person.
He left his goodbyes on Facebook earlier as he did before, Ile Vainio says.
The only thing you think is that Erkki Pällis is a multi-talented expert who became a brilliant journalist.
He reminds me of a person who liked Päll who had quick hot dogs and funny things.
I learned how to know Erk when I was a little boy when I was 12 years old, and I started working as a storekeeper there.
That's when we met Erk.
He was then the editor of the Finn disc and on various tasks, Ile Vainio remembers.
When I moved into making records, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Päll was the standard editor of all the events performed at the party about the artists.
He was always expert and I saw how big the fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got straight to the skin of his interviewers.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
To many he became familiar with as a respected radio driver for Yle, but he also wrote excellent journalisms.
Erkki interviewed me several times, too.
He was good at talking, Valio said.
Over the decades Pälli worked in addition to the supplier's work at the Fazer Disc Company with Hope Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Mati Loir's record.
However, the biggest passion for the song was radio work with its own style.
He did radio work since the 1960s, and he became familiar with a number of listeners at the Ylen ether.
The tab was retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association reported on Saturday that the financial year ending in May of the Union showed a profit of approximately EUR 450 000.
The association reflects the "full translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is certainly burdened by "a significant debt in balance sheet".
Managing Director Mika Kulmala calls for rapid response and strict financial discipline.
We reacted to the situation as soon as possible last autumn, making adjustment measures.
Careful planning and economic management of the operation has struck through our entire organization, Kulmala tells in the information.
We have also succeeded well in partnering and in addition to the world Cup returns, which were maximum during the previous period of competition.
However, also in the future, cost management needs to be precise and at the same time we need to keep looking for new financing models.

The Russian Dimitri Father and Ingerian mother Svetlana believed her daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
Recently, the parents of Miss Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov, and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud to follow their daughter's first crowns.
They went to the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the finals.
It's a wonderful atmosphere.
We believed each other all the time, but half an hour before the show started to get excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Inger and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks of smooth Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells me that Alina was less interested in acting and many other things than miss's career.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should be a miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio driver.
Only later, Alina got excited about the beauty contests.
The parent's wish was that Alina could go to college before she could take part in the Miss Suomi competition.
That's what happened, and in the end, Alina wanted to do her part before the Mississippi.
We've been asking about why he doesn't participate last year, but he wanted to complete that cover.

The wedding police did not comment on the conduct of the events on Saturday, nor was it possible to overrun the possibility of an attempt to compromise the investigation, calling on the disparateness of the investigation.

Sari Pippu left his career in Brussels and began to be a home mother in Finland - the idea of the cartoon came out of the picture: the lack of drawing skills slowed down.
At one time, my husband, who suggested that it be a story I developed as a person, says the espoolian comic blogist, mother and former EU translator Sari Pippu.
Sari Pippu says that he was an EU translator in Brussels until, after a fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've been really good at home.
It's been the best time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me that what it would do when a baby started to be a big one.
Then in 2014 there was a cartoon.
The bishop tells me that he never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Anka, Tintti and Asterix since he was little.
Last time I was a kid, I had a baby, but when these manuscripts of nature began to happen then, the situation changed.
At first I made a few dozen manuscripts in the table box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled artist, but I was unable to attract her until summer 2016, when I donated the Vii Vii by means of a drawing plate.
His zeal lasted a tenth of the strip, and then he had to start trying himself, he laughed at the Cup that tells him that the recording was a great encouragement to him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something for the time being.
I wasn't even trying to draw a paperman, telling him about his relationship to draw, which he usually does at night.
The manuscripts keep popping in mind, but I don't usually do it once.
It takes up to several hours for a single three square strip.
I might make a square at a time, and I'd be happy to play with the color.
Starting a drawing is always the hardest thing to do, because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Pippu tells me that he appreciates the modern-day series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
Persons of the animal are a carrot-skin mother who has a salad-skin suit, which is a carrot-skined mother.
Other people are Man, Piss and Twos.
In the natural world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from their own life and social media.
Sari Puppo doesn't want to preach or offer an obsessive shortage even though there is a matter between the Cows of Creation.
The lips tell you that they read their series with their husband and child.
I mean, it's a great feeling when you look at the cartoon you've been drawing, and you're telling me that this is what I've done today.
And there's plenty of challenges for my mom.

Rehn asked Yle about the end of Europe's trade war: "We have to look at the next Twite".
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the global economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been calculated across Europe and Finland's Bank has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
President Olli Rehn said in Ylen's first letter that although the tightening tension has no direct impact on the European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
Rehn believes that Europe is, for the time being, a very good bakery.
It has been able to build a peace of peace with the United States, and it has contributed to calming the situation also with China and Japan.
In Rehn’s view, Europe does not seem to be falling into the feet of the trade war.
I have to look at the next Twiite and then evaluate it.
We have a pretty unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, but he said in Ylen's interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the euro area and the Western largest countries in the world.
The market reacted strongly last Thursday night by the Italian Government to make a clear presentation of the deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of the population's output.
Rehn considers the situation in Italy to be worrying.
Five per cent of the country's loan stock is problem credit and unorganised credit accounts for more than 10 per cent.
Moreover, its public finances are weak and the country shows its commitment to its European partners again.
It may not be worth painting new crises, Rehn replied when he was asked whether Italy would take Europe to the new economic crisis.
Another European case is the United Kingdom's difference between the EU and the United Kingdom.
Rehn was hoping it would work out.
The difference between the dispute would have a much more negative impact on the situation.
Rehn started with the Director-General of the Bank of Finland in July.
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Mario Draghi will withdraw his duties after a fair year.
The debate on her has begun.
The name of both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liasen has been sprang in speech.
I'm sure you don't mind if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he was not going to comment on it further than this.

The popular Black Box presentations organised by Helsinki Sanjam will continue again at the start of the week.

There are still some tickets to the national theater for sale.
The Tampere performance is complete.
The tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on the stage will long tell the truth they have prepared, which has not been previously published in any HS tool.
There's something you've never heard of again.
"There are strange spies at the night of Helsinki, your impressive report from one side of the world and a very topical story about health issues", says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the suppliers and photographers of HS and continue the discussion.
The nights of living journalism have been organized by Helsinki Sanomat for three years.
They have been popular and often complete since the beginning.
More than 15 000 people have already visited the hotel.
The box was awarded in the Bonnier Gala as a journalistic act of the year.
The awarders thanked the new way to make journalism and journalists want to come close to their readers.
Spring season 2019 The Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March to April.
The performance is also visited in Tampere and Turku.
The presentation to be displayed at that time has a different content than the evenings in which it is present.
The missing herb was found because of the "unforeseen experiment".
The idea of a Finnish police drone is the world's top idea: "We're asking for training".
According to the Commissioner for Police College, the police can use drones in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in criminal investigations and intelligence.
The Oulu Police were able to find him on Tuesday, with the help of the herb drone of the herd who disappeared in Raha in just a few minutes.
President Kimmo Himberg of the University of Police College mentioned the case and mentioned, among other things, that "with prior experience and effective training, we are also the world's top in this too".
Drone is quite a new upheaval and even more recent police posts.
There are no statistics for the Finnish police to be the master of the use of drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is the case.
For example, this has occurred when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest in that, Himberg says.
It would be hard to bother visitors to watch the Finnish police drone operations.
We're asking for training.
More and more common
Himberg recalls that finding a missing person in Finnish winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As stated, in the case of Raahe, the lost was found with drones only within a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himberg says they're supposed to be trained more.
The drones are already being used for police duties, and their use is becoming more common and increasing in the future.
I'm afraid to say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to finding missing persons, the police, according to Himberg, can use drones, for example, in an accident or crime investigation and in certain types of intelligence.
For example, it is already necessary to check a region a little further, where it is possible to fear that violence will occur there.
Drone can then be used for preliminary information.
The Karelia Rugby rose up on the first division.
The Karelian Rugby party in Kuopio on Saturday for the 2-division victory.
In the middle of the game, the River Poles were still 7-12 shots to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found in the second period a plot and swept the South guests 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-Division Championship knew that Rugby was a historic rise in his 1-division.
In the past, the club has played first, but at that time the Finnish rugby serial activity had been divided into two levels, the SM series and its multi-stakeholder 1 division.
The Society is planning to accept the serial site, but next winter it will know quite a lot of work.
The current roster of almost 20 players must be raised to 25.
The 1-division is also known about the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so the funding procurement must also be consistent with that.
The Eagleniemi will begin the season in Montreal, confirm the head coach.
Claude Julien, head coach of Montreal Canadiens playing hockey in the NHL, confirmed that the Finnish beneficiary Jesper Kotkaniemi started the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super promise at the Kotkaniemi, 18th round by number three summer booking event.

Chief Coach Julien welcomed Finland's taking on a large development scale since the arrival of the new camp.
The NHL frame show starts next week, the night before Thursday, Finland Time.
Montreal meets the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What is a good leader?
This week, there has been a lot of talk about leadership in Finland.
Risto Siilasmaa, President of the Government of Nokia, told in the H.S. interview he described the Paranoid optimism in which he reflects his philosophy of leadership.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Olllila.
Olllila denied the accusations very much, but in the past, the Nokia inquiry has talked about the inability of the leaders to act as a team; the fear and indistinct, which led to the collapse of the mobile business.
The company's ability to take risks and agiles in the build-up phase disappeared.
During the week in Helsinki, a Nordic Business Forum was also held, leading the Finnish Business Forum to the Fair Center.
In addition to the leader of Barack Obama, Lavalle rose up to 12 business world stars.
That's enough for good management.
Gary Hamel said that a good leader should dare take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are mentally most closely linked to past decisions.
John Mackey, the founder of a wide range of the Tell Foods trade chain, said that the leader should be able to communicate to the entire staff the purpose of the company.
And that cannot be just a victory for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book on introverties, explained that most successful leaders are found to be humble.
They operate calmly, quietly and determinedly.
Often they're introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodara pointed out that the characteristics of a good leader must be struck together with the phase of the company's life cycle.
At the start of the company, the manager must be able to tell a story on which the future of the company is based.
The company that grew into a phased phase needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These guides at the Nordic Business Forum were listened to 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish leaders.
The risk was that they had an information feed.
A good leader is very much required.
That's why leadership goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Olllila.
They talked to each other in circles with each other.
However, they did not wonder whether they were the right leaders of Nokia at the right time.
Their humility was not easy for an outsider to judge.

Although he feels that work must be done harder, since the model work is always easy to find a replacement.
We've got to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The Danish police found a large vessel in the operation: "We can't tell you where"
The Danish police's wide search has produced results.
At the start of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of Jutinrauma and Iso-Belt.

The found car has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henry Storm of the Copenhagen police report to Ilt-Sanom.

According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Danish Extra Blaket told the police about Saturday's briefing.
Inspector Jørgen Bergen Skov was the cost of a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell you what a criminal code is being examined.
Skov said, however, that this was a serious crime.
It was about the threat to human life.

The name of Macedonia has been the cause of decades or decades - now the people will vote on this issue in dispute elections.
In the Balkans, Macedonia is currently voting on the proposal for a new country name.
According to the Treaty of Macedonia and the Treaty of Greek governments, the Republic of Northern Macedonia would be called the Republic of Macedonia.
Greece has so far prevented the efforts of Macedonia to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to Greece, the Greek name belongs to its northern region.
The referendum does not mention a new name, but an inquiry into whether or not the voters are in favour of the EU-NAT membership of Macedonia by adopting an agreement.
At least the capital school in Skopje, the capital, was played in the same way as the school in the city's downtown.
The retired nurse, Olivera Argirosvka, who has voted for the school, hoped for support for the agreement.
The referendum will mean a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been designated as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in official relations.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the Agreement.
On the other hand, the National Right opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called on the Bureau to refer the referendum to the vote.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the voting wage will rise above 50 % required.
The referendum is not binding, but yes/no victory would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution is required by a majority of two-thirds of Parliament.
The Greek Parliament is also yet to accept the agreement.
The stations will be closed from 8 p.m. to 8 p.m.
That's a great victory.

Canada is fighting time to reach peace with the United States of America in order to reach an agreement on the Napha with the United States of America.
The time threatens to end in the negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement on Napha.
The United States has set a regular Sunday, and country negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
The Canadian Prime Adviser, Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, suspended his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
With regard to President Donald Trump's demand for the United States, Canada and Mexico, about a year ago, negotiations started about a year ago on the reform of the North American Free Trade Agreement for the reform of the Naftan Free Trade Agreement.

The United States and Mexico want to enter into force before the Mexican presidential elections won Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that it is planned to sign an agreement at the end of November that Canada was involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the Agreement between the United States of America and Canada should be prepared on Sunday to allow the United States Congress sufficient time to assess it.

Students act in a rare way: ancient tragedy - a simple Orestee has a visual influence on his visual appearance.
Ancient tragedy is a rare taste for Finnish plays.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen ancient tragedy, Soofokleen Filoctetes, 1988.
Now the theatre school brought ancient music trilogy, Aiskhylos Oresteus, to a tour of the National Theatre.
In 2015 the Platforms open! projects are carried out in collaboration with the professional director internationally.
The director of this fourth project, like the first one, is Mikko Roiha, Berlin.
In April Berlin, the international first night Orestee received his international first night in the year of Berlin.
The reconciliation between Oresteea and the conclusion of the bloodbath of the Atreus family, which was destroyed, and the birth of the rule of law, for one hour to twenty minutes, in particular, more frequent loads.
The work will be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simon Nagy’s fine filter (2003).
The dramatic light and the appearance of the theatre pages highlight a simple and clear scene thinking.
Its focus is on the dynamics between the performers that break off the chorus, and those who play the nominal roles of the chorus, and the dynamics between the chorus.
The presentation uses both double and triangular terms for the title roles.
The actors do not leave the scene at all, so, for example, the murder of Agamemnon and this war hall of Kassandra is shown on stage, unlike the ancient performance tradition.
Of course, the proposal does not stress that it is faithful to the ancient performance tradition.
Rather, in front of the viewer's eyes, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is being created which is constantly conscious of its ritual roots.
Roiha has managed to get the Master phase of acting students out as a close group, mainly as one organism, a group of rhythms occurring.
Especially in choro sections, well-expressed, sculptured group formations, cleverly inclined actors can access their rights on the cover, only by cleaning the white curtain, on the stage.
I'm impressed.
The Orestea presentation tour continues to be held at the Theatre of Kruvola and Oulu.
The Korean manufacturer prepares his first hydrogen-cracker.
The gap starts to appear in Europe, in particular thanks to the cooperation agreement concluded with Hyinda and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the cooperation agreement published in the IAA commercial vehicle exhibition, Hyundai delivers a thousand car batch of novelty models for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By placing on the market a fuel-powered truck Hyundai will continue with Nexon as well as ix35/Tukson Fuel Cell model by referring to the road as a vehicle manufacturer.
In this quality, with the first project in the world, we are increasingly taking fuel cell technology beyond our borders.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by following the development of the refuelling network, Deputy Managing Director of Hyundai Motor In Cheol Lee said at the contract release ceremony.
The summers were caught several times several times in Kajaan, Kajaan.
A little over 30 men abused three men at a restaurant in the centre of Kajani and represented it on Saturday at the morning of the morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which led to his removal from the scene.
In the outside, he hit another man's country, and in the absence of a third man, the abuser still hit him.

The man also threatened the police by assault and killing.
The man was taken to jail to calm down.
The case is investigated in three cases of assault and violent opposition from an official.
In the middle of Kajaan, there was also another case of assault in the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the street in the morning from the morning.
The victim was abused by two men.
First, about 20-year-old Kajaniman hit the victim.

However, the perpetrators were already able to leave before the police arrived.
Police are calling on witnesses to contact Kajaan police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to the investigation.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio driver Erkki Pälli is dead.
Erkki Päll, known as Yle's long-term supplier, died of cancer when he was 83 years old.
Radio drinker Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
She died of incurable liver cancer, which was reported on the Facebook page in March 2018.
This is it.
The doctor has said that I live on a daily basis, too, he commented on his situation in the evening press a month ago.
The safety of trade fillings and sediments must be guaranteed guarantee the guarantee of safety in trade.
For the first time, I got paid for a press release in 1984.
When something is surprising about these years, it is usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of workers in retail trade, I was surprised and briefly even a little bit angry.
I also spoke about the work of the Trade Union for Services (PAM) Labour Environment Expert, Erika Käärä.
He says that criminal statistics do not tell the real situation.
The problem is growing, even though employers claim otherwise, of course.
The police will only be informed of cases that have been clearly serious and many real violent situations will remain unreported.
"There is, of course, an obligation for companies to keep their statistics close to the one on the basis of the safety law at work, but these statistics remain for internal use and not to collect their data anywhere," he said.
Mental injuries do not end in the statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that they do not always produce physical injuries.
In spite of this, mental trauma may be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to draw the difference between a violent situation and a dangerous violent situation when a certain level of aggressive threats must also be counted as violence - even if there is no hand-to-hand use.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even though the real thing never happens.
Some residential areas are restless.
The shop has acquired guards.
At the time of the release of the trading venues, even in the media, steaming was time to have a significant impact on the safety of sellers.
"In the meantime, a number of employers arranged security services for at least night hours, as well as to avoid working alone", Kähä commented.
If nothing happens, we'll get the wrong conclusion.
It now seems to have had an effective effect, but this produces a new negative trend.
For reasons of security, when the disturbances were well maintained, the idea was that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, we are trying to find solutions that could remove expensive security services.
A slight abuse is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that a salesman who has been abused does not want to make an inquiry into a criminal who usually lives near the trade.
However, according to the same provision of the 2011 Act, mild abuse becomes subject to prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think we're going to need some suggestions now.
The next time you're selling your aunt or you're being abused, the police should look into him and the prosecutor's prosecutions.
If the court were to put a few abusers in prison, and the judgment on that penalty rate was made from the hard end, the customs would get tidyed up.
A society in which the food trade must be open even in small places for almost a day must ensure the safety of workers' work.
Heidi Sohlberg signed the miss before the start of a direct transmission - "Sara, Iiro is married"
The miss crown is not seen this year as usual on TV, but on Viafree's website.
Former Miss Suomi Heidi Sohlberg and Viasatin and Viaplayn NHL and KHL studio host Iiro Harjula.
Backstage and the red carpet as the driver is Janni Hussi.
Before the direct broadcast, the running three informed the guests who arrived and the media representatives about the cost of the transmission.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula some disgusting applause.
Now all women scream!
Now, look at this man's drinker, Sohlberg, at the cheer of his colleague's audience.
A number of privileged races are followed by Miss Finland in the past.
Amongst other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Siepp were sitting next to him and Sohlberg threw a little joke in one direction.
Sara, Iro is then married.
Sohlberg cut me in the middle of the corner.
The more I think Sohlberg referred to the newly resigned Sieppi, who laughed at the comments, even though it seemed initially confused.
The Witness spoke of her divorce for the first time in the Ilta-Sanom's weekend newspaper.
Missiunotar told me that he does not want to open the difference more precisely in public because it is a matter between him and Roope Salmis.
He said he wasn't busy with a new relationship, he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focused on my own things, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, and Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage status came up at a later stage, when Sohlberg was accidentally mistaken to call Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a parade.
I mean, I've got three of them laughing at me.
I didn't say it was fucked or how did it go?
Janni Hussi gave me the dress.
The Northman tortured his tied open party by cutting, burning and feeding a strong sauce.
On the top of the north, the 34-year-old man in Kokkola has sentenced his numerous crimes against his nobles for three years to prison.
The crime tool included belts, cables and buttons.
The court condemned these objects as being lost to the State.
There was a particular charge that was involved in a suspect's serious rape.
However, this accusation was rejected by the court of origin.
The cocoon was responsible for four acts of abuse, gross assault, forcedness, illegal threats, violations of liberty, gross imprisonment, and two damage.
The crime took place between 26 March and 24 May.
At the end of the last actions, a man was arrested and imprisoned a couple of days later.
Last Thursday, the Supreme Court of Bothnia gave its judgment and ordered 34-year-olds to remain in Vaasa prison.
There is no evidence of rape without evidence of any evidence of rape.
34-year-olds were also accused of two gross violations of freedom and of brutal rape on 22 May.
However, these grounds were rejected as being unobtrusive.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the Court of First Instance issued a public statement of the judgment.
According to the Complainant, the defendant had committed violence, threats and forcedness of his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut his victim with a knife, burned with a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
The court has ordered the State to have lost criminal instruments: the belt and cable, the stripes, the belt, the knife and the bathroom.
Four Witnesses
Under the sovereignty of the European Union, the parties to the European Union continued their cooperation between the European Union and the European Union.
It is clear from the statement that a large part of the most serious acts took place at the end of the period of the criminal offence.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim's 34-year-old will receive compensation for pain, pain, suffering, and temporary harm of EUR 5800.
He's barely got any of the money he's got, because the convicted has already been in debt in his legacy.
The prison sentence is not the first of a man.
The afternoon newspaper does not state the name of the sentenced person to protect the victim's privacy.
This is not the case in writing.
Europe under the leadership of four points for a Ryder Cup solution.
On Saturday, European golf professionals captured their leadership in a traditional hole game against the United States of America.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup to be played in Paris by points 10-6, while there are still 12 doubles to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four quadriball games that started on Saturdays, and in the afternoon four-game, the winnings were equal to 2-2.
The European leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won on Friday and Saturday during all four pairs of the match they were playing.
In the past, no European couple had ever been involved.
On Sunday, the twin aims for more history.
No European player has won five points in one of the Ryder Cup, and no American player has ever made it like three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the violent harassment of its supporters in the Honka game: "Future does not belong to football".
On Sunday, HJK played football team published a notice condemning its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka game in Tapiola.
"We are calling for events after the Honka-HJK match for our supporters," the communication states.
At the end of the fight, about 50 HJK's supporters were rushing into the field and some seemed to try to challenge the Honga supporters of the dispute.
There was also a fight between the beneficiaries.
The organisers didn't get the situation to calm down, but they needed police, including horsemen.
HJK reports that the team's players and staff are shocked by what happened.
The events after the game are not consistent with the values of our usual 111-year-old club.
"We strongly reject any action that endangers the safety of the game", the communication states.
HJK's consent will help authorities and event organisers to identify safety threats and eliminate mild phenomena.
Supporter culture is a part of football and HJK's important business.
In every way, we support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football surveys.
"The power doesn't belong to it," the communication says.
The Philippine inventions fly by a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
The Mendiola is a philipinian invention, hip-hop dancer, and some kind of Pelle Peloto.
He is now part of a growing group of people in the world, who swears that he invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, the Mendiola does not believe in mass production of its equipment.
According to the reports from the world, a man has spent most of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his car six years ago.
Now he's calling development a drone car.
Recently, he says he's done the first successful test flight... and he's ticketed his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the machine will produce positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said that the British Daily Mail said it was a British Daily Mail.
The JHHH forecast: Work activities to begin tomorrow will be visible in day-care and social and health services for children and social and health services.
In the public and welfare sectors tomorrow, the bans on over-work and exchange will be visible, especially in social and health services and day care for children, and will be assessed by the President of JHL Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be wide-ranging and will certainly be visible in a way that does not have sufficient staff available.
Someone has to wonder how they're gonna get their kids.
The employer's job now is to make sure that services are playing and that no one's spirit is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Late, the shortage of workers also appeared at the beginning of the year when the JHL members were in an overwork and exchange ban due to the negotiation of the Agreement.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility to ensure that the staff are not hired, but that workers have been overpaid or shifted.
This is not yet a work struggle.
It is quite normal for each worker to take care of and only to do so on a regular basis.
The JJL opposes the Government's intention to reduce the protection of the dismissal of small enterprises.
Markku Jalonen, Director-General of the Executive Director of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors, does not intend to anticipate the impact of the bans on over-work and exchange.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although the services may be weakened.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have prepared the preparations for what are to be done.
The area is so far-reaching, social and health measures and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary widely between industry, region and employers, Jalonen said to STT.
Mr Jalonen says that last week, experience has already been gained from three-day activities carried out by the Super, social and health trade union for Europe.
Their effects were rather minor.
The WHO's ban on over-work and shifting applies, among other things, to municipalities, church, state, and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are excluded.
At this stage, the fight against labour concerns nearly 100,000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Late, the activities of JHL may last for a long time.
The association is also prepared for other work-related measures if the act of termination continues to be drawn up.
The government should now admit that this was a wall and a hard one.
I think that both the ay movement and the government must come up against them.
It's special here that the hard ones are already on the top, even though the performance hasn't been given yet, Jalone's updating.
The great Corlarity is formed by the strengths of children and adults - in the fitness circles of the show’s gyms of the race and sea horse are studied in the gyms of the race and sea horse.
The Great Corallery of the other farms received the first evening in Hamburg last spring, and on last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kannalháza.
Like the previous works of the group, Great Coralism is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
However, this time a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and highlight the findings of the initial exercises.
The theatre game has plenty of hundreds of magic for children’s participants as well.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
However, the highest standard is not a children's performance, but a performance that adults and children do in cooperation with each other.
It will provide adults with information and observations on how to use children to receive information and to do art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint games will also lead to the separation of the distance between adults and children.
The great Coralism reminds me of a certain amount of fairy tales, fitness and natural information, but ultimately it is spread around visits under different, non-humanized conditions.
The large coral flooring starts with access to the business paths of corals and live organisms and fish on the coral floor.
The six different fitness zones teach, among other things, the life of raus and sea horse.
Finally, a little hour-long performance will be made, with music, light and shiny paints and costumes to help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are people in the Great Coral Shirt who observe the life and corals of the corals that are considered.
There are also bodies that look at coral.
The observations and observations shown in a number of directions make the show dense and life faded.
Whether or not there is an animal's landscape, a landscape-to-earth organism and another animal-to-be area - and all of this at the same time.
For a kid, it doesn't seem difficult.
On other premises, the group is working on the limits of thought and action to which access is challenging when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, having children makes it more significant.
After the workshop, Sittor will have a silent demonstration on behalf of the endangered corals.
It should not be hard to let people destroy beyond their understanding, even though it may be difficult to understand the significance of exercising their own self - support in the face of disasters anymore.
On other premises, it has built its work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also with a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are different species of awareness, other species, and their future generations, for which it cleans space for the wondering and cutting.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad that there was no smartphone in my childhood.
Children and young people today are more irresponsible than ever.
Young people start smoking and drinking when they are younger and younger all the time.
I think that children should be children throughout their childhood, and they shouldn't mess up their lives for the sake of substance and sex, because others say they do.
I was ashamed when my friend told me that he had had to go for his sister in the fifth grade this weekend from his boyfriend.
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experience that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation, because we've been told and warned all our childhood that drugs can't be touched and sex is an adult case.
I hope that today's children would be able to live a decent childhood, and they wouldn't have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing more and more girls on Instagram, who are in their pictures of makeup in their face and reveal their clothes on their head.
Snapchat is used in the evening to take and send exposed pictures.
It's even harder to guess how old she is.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and older people.
My childhood was composed of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad that there was no smartphone in my childhood.
I had to be a kid for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people were thinking about me.
Yle: The authorities have informed the Heads of Government that the case of Airistos Helmi is not related to national security security.
According to Ilkka Kanerva, Ylen's interviews were conducted by the Defence Police and Defence Forces to inform the Defence and Foreign Affairs Councils earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that Airisto Helme's investigation is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, news to Yle.
The information about the anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and Defence Policy were conducting an ongoing investigation this week in the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were quite strict that they did not speculate that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commenting on Yle's interview.
According to the above data, no evidence of connection to national security has been found so far in the case of seized material, but the investigation is only under investigation.
There is nothing we can know yet about what can be revealed from there, one of Ylen's interviewers says.
A week ago, extensive domestic search started in Turku and the mainland has raised the question of whether the investigation is about mere economic crime or about the threat to domestic security within Finland.
Earlier this week, the evening paper prepared a case that will examine the arguments both for and against.
Video: The dream image saved Liverpool's loss series.
Liverpool's 100% Valiolig's start was finished, but it was still more satisfied with the team 1-1 game at Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be quite a year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away from the 1-0 guest gain.
Then the Pep Guardiolan combination sent the whole Valolianga signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure that Liverpool's manager Jûggen Klopp arrived with the same idea in West London.
The Reds had begun Valioliga with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool began stronger, and in particular Virgil van Dijk felt that it was dominant alone in its own field end.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had less than a Wednesday's fine holcup with a foreign gain from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Merard rose from the change bench to solve the match with a wonderful individual offer.
Now, of course, it's been the first time since the first few minutes.
25 minutes later, he played in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorgegho.
Finally, the Croats saw him rushing forward and sent him a fully-dimmed push.
The quake ran a little around the penalty zone, but from there bombed a perfect left foot bet in the rear corner of the rear corner.
Half of the Brassier Alison was a little slow in her fight and she didn't get her finger head on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss position was mildly unfair because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger was put down on the goal of Mo Salah's direction.
In the second period, Chelsea-vest Kepa also got a real job.
The Basque guard quickly reacted to Sadio Manen's bet and pushed the ball from the top to the corner shot.
On the other hand, Alison, in turn, zeroed its discards through the Murard stream.
The best place for visitors came in 72 minutes when James Milner found a concentration of Bobby Firmino.
However, Brassijärus bag was headed toward the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the master's leadership.
Neither could it last in 89 minutes when an exchangeman Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played with his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of an unconceivable bet in the upper corner of the upper corner.
Liverpool's 100% over-start was completed with a 1-1 game, but it's still on the line with Manchester City.
Chelsea also has a tightly involved in the championship with two points behind the top of the line.
In the debate on the transmission, the poters are very deep.
I remember a few decades ago, a magazine asked a variety of Finnish influences, which divides the people of Finland.
The only answer of Juice Leskisen was that of Nin.
Some people in their last name have a n-poor, and some do not.
I mean, you can be born anywhere, and here's a little bit of a coffee.
Finland has achieved that the annual shift of time has been abandoned in the EU.
Many people agree that the shift of clocks twice a year has been a fool's work and has caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, even though it has not been easy.
It is now more difficult to determine what time ends at the end of time: the current summer or winter or any other time zone.
This also leads the people to say their opinion on the sample.fi page.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it is open on Friday 12 October.
The discussion will be held at coffee tables and social media, and everyone will have a say in their words.
With the effect of the morning light on human well-being and summer time, the defenders who defend their position during wintertime defend themselves with the effect of evening light on the desire for people's outdoors and thus on well-being.
On both sides, there are strong supporters and good reasons for doing so.
In fact, research has shown that morning light rhythms man's day and gives a sense of relaxation.
On the other hand, if not especially suffering from awakening in the dark, the brightness of people’s movements outside and gives better opportunities, for example, for autumn trips.
The number of extra light after normal working day has already been calculated per hour.
I'd rather have both of them, but bad for us to be in the northeast of the earth, we can't do anything.
The winters are too dark and summer too bright for many in any case.
It is typical of the debate on this subject that your own view of driving and the second view is very strongly opposed.
The argument of the counterparty is not much to listen to, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is not enough to try to turn one's head around.
That's where the square is wasted.
The subject is a very simple argument, because it does not require a large commitment and a complicated feeling of complexity is sufficient to justify it.
Similar issues are usually discussed more strongly and in a single fruity manner.
Well, I'm sorry if the wrong option is chosen, but I'm sure you'll fit in with it.
And it always offers a proper scapegoat if life feels like a sense of heart.
He fought for a strange foreign gain, which he fought for.
The first visit to the Sabibandyn Divar was produced by Nurmon Jymy, against the full three sets.
The Joba went from Seinäjoki on its way home with a great 6-5 (3-1, 1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
Nurmo still led to paint at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In the 50th time, the brothers Eeu and Juusi Lehtiniemi were planning a 6-5-5 victory prize.
For both teams, a crucial minute was played in the coolness of both teams.
The most effective was Juus Lehtiniemi (2+1).
By the way, the second chain was a firepower when Teemu Cinderella (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettun (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) played his goal at the time he was born, too, in the second chain.
After a three-series tour, he's got six points.
Next up comes O2-Jyväskylä in guests in two weeks' time.
Enon at the church on Sunday at the 200th anniversary of the 200th anniversary of the church.
The 200th anniversary of Eno's church will be held on Sunday morning in part in very sad atmospheres.
A week ago, the burning of the church in an upholstery danger was a shock.
Eno's church was also guarded during the two nights after the fire.
Despite a lot of money, today is still the place for a party.
If so, no one would like to have, Eno's church is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Congregation Society.
The church in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart despite all the municipal and other associations of the world.
The family event begins at Enon church today at 10:00 a.m., the church begins at Eno's church today at 10:00 a.m.
Then move to the parish house at the cattle’s table.
There's a lot of things in the program all day long, inside and out.
For example, a church building can be used with the guidance of Ari Räsänen, who has retired 37 years of church mastership.
The anniversary of the church's birth also means the end of one era.
The church house, built in 1982, has opened its doors for the last time today.
We're in the middle of nowhere in the old town hall, Markku Koistinen says.
The church was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has been in good health for that 200 years.
El Elon Musk will claim to President of the President of the Government of   Tesla President's President's President's President's President's President's President's President's President's president's president's president's president of the  Tesla's Board of the Government's President's President's President's President - Petos's charges were settled for $40 million $40 million worth $40 million worth worth of $40 million.
Tesla and Elon Musk, CEO of the company, have agreed to the case with SEC, the US Securities Regulatory Authority.
SEC suspected Muskin had committed a security fraud, and Musk was in danger of being excluded from the company it was founded.
However, the Musk may continue as CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk has to be absent from the seat of the President of the Government of Tesla for a period of three years.
The company will have to hire the President of an external board.
The musket is also subject to tighter controls.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent leaders and continue to monitor Muskin's communication in further detail.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay both $20 million (approximately EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and disadvantages to the shareholders of Tesla", says Director Steven Peiki from SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock market.
The Mus also wrote that the company's funding was secure.
The Tvít immediately increased the stock exchange rate for Tesla.
SEC suspected Muskin was involved in the securities fraud.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with other management or potential donors of the company.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it was going to sue the company and Muskin.
SEC stated that it would require Musk to be sentenced to fines and that he would be forbidden to act in the direction of the stock exchange companies.
The SEC challenge was alarmed by investors, and Tesla's share took off on a strong fall.
More than 800 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia, Indonesia, more than 800 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunamis of Indonesia.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, according to the AFP, the National Disaster Agency reports.
The number of deaths is believed to increase further, as the investigation is in progress.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kallan, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked the town of Please, on Sulawes Island.
A warning was issued immediately after the earthquake, however, which was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all of the known deaths are at least for the duration of the Request.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the region of Donggasa, near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already a number of people are known to have died.
Irony calls for help.
The Indonesian army has been alarmed to help rescue workers seek victims.
President Joko Widododon, who arrived in the area today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work without becoming exhausted day and night.
One of the centers of the rescues is the hotel in Palu, which is believed to have between 50 and 60 people in ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syaugi, told us that one person was able to dig the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel at night.
We also heard people's calls for help, he told me.
According to the cygueg, heavy larvae equipment would be quickly needed in the earthquake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones lost.
Please help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family is still missing, one writer called on the Facebook group.
Polipolis telephone numbers leaked into the hands of disruptors in Britain.
Many British politicians were subject to harassment when their contact details were leaked because of the deficiencies in the encryption of the application.
The alarms got caught, among other things, in the phone numbers of the ministers.
It was an application used by the United Kingdom Conservative Convention.
For example, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were subject to harassment.
Several Members of the Parliament received alarm calls.
Due to the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profile of the politicians who were in the mobile app of the Conservative Party's annual meeting.
The public had access to the profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
The profile came to see and edit the recorded material in the profile.
Someone managed to replace Boris Johnson's profile picture for a moment as an insult to porn and title.
Michael Goven's profile picture was replaced by a picture of mediamogul Rupert Murdoc's Rupert Murdoc.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows you to login to other people's profiles by e-mail addresses.
Then the loginer can view the profile person's contact information and perhaps send messages in this name.
The meeting application was made by each of the journalists, politicians and the participant's telephone number to the public, Foster criticised it.
The conservative informant requested an apology for the data leak.
He said that the technical problems have been solved and the application is now functioning safely.
The UK Information Authority ICO supported the data leak.
The application was made by a Australian Crown Comms company.
The oppositionary Labour Party is critical of the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
The Wall Finland audience has every week a large number of people who are wanted to visit the Wall Finland.
Watchful viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience of The Wall Finland.
The fast-growing American form The Wall beached the English version of the English version to Neos last Saturday.
They hosted the game show in Paasas is described in the same studio in Poland where other international productions of the format are made.
In the Polish studio, there were exceptional opportunities to describe the format as a large 12 metres high game wall required space from space.
During the start-up period, the social media highlighted the programme’s studio audience, which was cut to half.
On Twitter, there was a discussion about whether or not the Polish people might be sitting in the studio sitting on a game to be played in Finnish.
The Head of Nellosen’s domestic programmes, Une Sormune, will illustrate the matter to the evening magazine.
He says that there are players close to the studio, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
In Finland, the audience is composed of international fighters, just as the audiences of the series The Wall described in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such porous, so-called professional audiences who go to the descriptions of different programmes, Sormunen recalls.
He reminds me that monitoring the game itself is not so difficult, even though it does not understand the language by which it is played.
It is easy to distinguish red and green balls from the wall.
However, there are interpreters for foreign-language studios that carry out translation work.
There are two interpreters that interpret the simulations as an interpretation to the studio controller all the time.
And the studio director then directs the audience and tells us what kind of laptop is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormunen says.
He compares the situation with the way David Hasselhoff was delivered in domestic production yesterday.
David Hasselhoff was involved a few years ago in Talent Finland's descriptions in our Finland.
He always became the simulate interpretation of the ear, and he knew everything that was said in the photographs in Finnish, the sum of the Ringune sum.
Japan’s floods are moving towards the main island - the authorities warn of the earthquakes and floods from the mountains and floods from the mountains and floods.
The authorities also warn about possible lands and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in the Taoven Tram, but according to the authorities, large injuries have been avoided and there are currently no data on death victims.
In the south of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated into shelters, and electricity has been cut from over 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are standing shut down because of the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka for half a day in Finland.
Capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also strong winds and rains.
The train shifts have been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to the weather forecasters, Trami is going to torture Japan until Monday.
The thunder of the heavens continue my dark darker.
The initial period of the Aces has been bad.
The sky would be almost as long as the team lost its way home on Saturday to Vaasa Sport by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
There are now five consecutive losses in the carrots, and there are two points in a total of six rounds.
No Ässe defender or two lower chain players have yet to scored.
The pressure is growing, too, all the time.
The sport is against the audience from the hug even at the moment the game was almost half left.
Six games are only scared, and of course there is no reason to give up.
Of course, we should be careful, because we've played so badly.
In particular, the second part of the presentation was disgracefully poor, and Jarno Kärki told me about Järno Kärki's performance of Ässi.
To the sport, of course, the victory tasted.
The team had a game down on Friday, so it would have thought it would have been visible.
Maybe it did, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors of the Thursday continued to increase.
On the day of the day, the mother of Pirkko Hyurinen wonders about the audience of the event at the big hall watching.
It was something that I thought maybe not this year would be so many people, Mr. Urinen would think about it in the morning.
At the same time, in autumn 2017, a series of Tractoricynn’s MS competitions were held at the same time with bread, so perhaps the expectations would be that the audience could even count slightly from the previous year.
However, it happened; the corridors were already back in good shape before ten, the sellers said the products had ended, the news was sold more than 500 doses in the past, and even in the number of cars, Mr Hyärinen heard an increase.
The survey of the number of visitors has been about 6,000, Jurvinen will tell you later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon five hours, a particularly large number of programmes for families with children were available, which, I think, attracted them to a record count.
In addition, Jõärinen estimates the event to be achieved even further away.
The sellers also chart Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, the sellers of performers, handicrafts, pastries and harvest products had arrived at almost 100 bakers.
On the day of the cake, Mother Kärinen was delighted to see the audience from the hall's viewers.
At the beginning of the day, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series Teija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the audience vote.
The children's bread competition arrived in 11 different forms of bread.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the Russies competition, spent the day at the market pie shop on the market.

Bring the space back to life, create the right mood for decorating and read the book without being tired.
It's worth sats for good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons for investing in lighting.
The tips were given by Tarja Jokinemi, Director of Sales and Marketing of Intlux.
Do a favor to your eyes.
The more the years of age are behind them, the greater the importance of illustration.
Sufficient light can help people to deal with problems that will occur with age when the vision's accuracy is reduced and more and more dazzling is affected.
The need for light also increases between parents.
Nineteen needs light three times more than twenty.
Therefore, it is worth raining for health reasons.
I'm happy to give you enough light, but no shame, some kind of tip.
Create beauty around the beauty.
Beautiful interior can only be revealed with the right lighting solutions.

The sabotage operation of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition of tradition.
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign investigation into SVR or the GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name is from the Russian-speaking words diversionno-razvedyvajnaja group: the sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service in the West of KGB prepared detailed plans for key sabotage sites, reports the archive manager Vasili Mitroh, who was set up in the West of KGB (1922-2004).
His data was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and in the early 2000s.
Items included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and pipeline connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired uniforms and accessories for DRG groups for the cover operations of Bundeswehr, railways, hardware guards and certain factors.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they were dressed in local Ukrainian police chest attacks, set up inspection stations in the heart of Ukraine for you leading to Ukraine and isolated them from Crimea's mother country.
Agents of the Cold War hid items for the sabotage groups in the ground with mines, explosives, lighters and media.
In 1998 there was a KGB's hole in Switzerland, which was destroyed when the authorities sprayed it with a water tank.

A real story on TV today: The climber was left to death twice.
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journal Home From Everest is based on a man’s experience with his own.
Tonight's film was made based on it.
Everest is now receiving her first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, the devastating snow storm surprised the climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákur's 2015 management tells us about the survival struggle that has been dealt with in the cereals field.
There's been some movies and documents made from the Tragedian before.
There are also events going on here.
The highest mountain in the world, 22 years ago, took the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were the experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall was just the guide from Weathers.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery carried out before Nepali left.
As a result of that pressure and the air pressure, he lost sight and therefore had to miss out on the peak.
Rob Hall continued on his way, and he never returned.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had just begun.
As the storm rose, he was lost and never found him back in camp.
When we came here to find him, he was found so badly that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers were left to die.
What a miracle, though, he still got on his feet and found the others.
The unfortunate Weathers thought that he was still dying, and once again he was left behind for his own happiness.
It is clear that, contrary to different expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even coyoters began to believe the possibility that he was given help.
In the film Beck Weathers performs Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we have a celebration of 200-year-old Eno Church.
Enon's 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church museum.
The church was held on 4 October 1818, and the entire family party was prepared for the celebration on Sunday.
The party began at Eno's church house at 10 o'clock at the family fair, after which the cattle's table was served at Eno's church house.
The church was full.
517 persons participated in the Family Hall.
Eno’s Church Lord Armi Rautavuori was glad that people had come so much to the church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work, says Rautavuori (in the picture).
The fire of the shrovel church has touched many, and it was not missed at the 200th anniversary of the congregation of Eno.
Eno's church is now the oldest church in the Gospel Lutheran Church of Joensuu after the destruction of the fire.
In 1770, the tree church of the stimulant danger was completed in 1770.
A discussion was held this morning in which the church was silenced and remembered in the fire destroyed.
Pictures and videos: The Medikan avoided his mighty power in Greece - the sea disappeared and street turned into a river.
A powerful Hurricane-style Syrian storm rolled down to Greece on Saturday for lunch this year.
The Mediterranean Hurricane or median is named Zorba.
The Greek Aviation Institute has issued a red weather warning for the areas of Attika, Peloponnesus, Joonian Islands, Kyklads and Kreeta.
The images taken from the area show plenty of floods all over Greece.
The video published on Twitter shows how suddenly a river has appeared between houses in the town of Kiato in the region of Corinth instead of the street because of floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported into flood waters.
In the southern part of the Peloponne Peninsula, heavy wind caused heavy shipping.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens will guide people on their Facebook page to prepare themselves for the storm in Greece.
The mission will encourage monitoring of weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
The Mediterranean Hurricane, or median, will bring with it heavy sauces and even a flood risk.
According to CNN, a 2011 survey indicates that mediacans appear only once or twice a year throughout the world, typically in the course of September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The outbreak of the storm left the floods in Tunisia and Libya before moving to the north and towards Europe.
Greece has also been concerned about refugee camps on islands, such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to proper protection.
In the summer of the summer, the areas destroyed by landtops are also left under the storm in the surroundings of Athens.
In Greece, also last November, the median was suffocated in Greece.
We must not go to the sea now, but flights are still on schedule - thousands of Finns are currently holiday thousands of Finns on Greek islands threatened by the Syrian storm of the Greek islands threatened by the Syrian storm.
The voyages to the sea are withdrawn and while walking should also be careful not to fly any branches or other bulk goods into the storm on top of the storm.
Such instructions have been distributed to 3 500 in Greece on a holiday weekend in Finland via Sun trips.
The guidelines will be needed, as even the Zorbas storm that is getting a little bit scared has been predicted for this weekend to be the island of a narrowing Greece.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, wind speed may rise up in a wooden plane up to 45 meters per second.
Conviction of the weather increases heavy rainfalls.
Through solar travel and Tui, all passengers from Finland who have notified their telephone numbers have been warned about heavy winds by SMS, according to the tour operators.
In the weather, still sun and heat.
According to Inka Ikonen, expert on solar travel communication, the worst has been avoided since the beginning of the Saturday night.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we've been watching the situation all the time.
We'll be safe in front of you.
Antonia Schroderus, accompanies mediaist, says that their flights have also been scheduled for their flight.
We are in constant contact with our personnel in charge.
At least Crete was still calm, and on Saturday he told me about the beginning of the night.
At present, the most popular Greek islands, namely Rodox and Crete, have a total of 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to arrive Sunday morning.
On Saturday afternoon, Rodox had been mocking the sun and the temperature went up to 27 degrees," says the iconen of the Sun Tours.
Zorbas has been estimated to become the next Turkish crisis, although slightly reduced.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there and, for example, have checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tui, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss fully identical evenings in the Massifial - this is how they react to the situation.
The media person and fitness-universal Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Suomi final on Saturday in an open-minded evening dress.
Hussi tells me he's got a dress from Messlew.
I went out and decided to trust professionals who found me a wonderful dress for this evening, Hussi smiles.

It is essential that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi thought about it.
Before moving on to Hussi's holiday alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in a week's hotel without leaving anywhere.
When the stress went off, I got a flu, but otherwise the vacation was really successful, Hussi tells me.
Shirly Karvis’s behavior on the plane gave a lot of attention - gathered the curious eyes of pensioners ’ curious eyes of pensioners.
Drainer and 2016 Miss Suomi Shirly Karvinen told Miss Suomi final on a red carpet she had enough to do with radio drunks and Love Island Finland descriptions.

This is the glamour.
Nightdress change at home, Hairy laughs.
Karvininen tells me that he has pulled his makeup out among pensioners.
His preparation also drew the attention of fellow passengers.

How do I dress up for superstaps?
Three perfect sets of performances.
Classic clothes are clothes that operate from season to season in a different dress than in a dress.
In many cases, classics are decades old, but sometimes they fit in with the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the superstitious boots that rose into the autumn and winter season have not left anything.
In accordance with the above generation, boots are repeated in style from year to year and from season to season.
Looks like boots share the opinion of users, but a bold model is worth trying, well - bravely.
In fact, the superstitious boots are really suitable for any kind of housing community.
Whether it's a tail, lace, girl or trick, the boots' simple leather or artificial leather leather skin works.
Long boots look good in the party halls as well as in the everyday costumes.
Black oversanding boots are suitable for very tender outfits, too.
They properly balance the softness of the pink, flower-plender tooth and the light, sticky needle.
A fresh but autumn elegant archetype of romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-retro-like outfit is formed from a long copper-brown seam, overburn boots, displayable earrings and a cut-off bag.
Although there is a certain fineness in the upper poles, they are also perfect for the relaxation of the arctics together with the t-shirt, the long shorts and the trendy box.
It's so easy and still so elegant.
Two motor motor cars start operating in Espoo, Espoo, in Espoo, two motor cars start operating two motor cars in motor cars.
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, informs the City of Espoo.
The VOCs are working on the role of the bus simulator, as next spring we will start transport by the robot bus next spring.
The project will develop and pilot all year round-to-year robot transport and will test the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
Try to find out how motorcars are capable of working on the existing street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Transport Manager.
For the first time, motorcars go completely automatically within the range of other transports without specific transport arrangements.
Vehicle safety is always the responsibility of a ride-by-passer who is always in charge of the safety of vehicles.
The vehicles have been able to feel their surroundings on several different sensors all the time and assess whether the driveway is free.
If that is not the case, they interpret whether an obstacle has been found to the vehicle, the bicycle or, for example, the snow brake, will be explained by Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4 which is responsible for the development of robot transport.
Motor cars will travel throughout the autumn on three days a week: on Tuesday at 13-15:30 a.m., Wednesdays at 10-15 a.m. and Thursdays at 10-15 a.m. on Thursdays.
Motor cars stop by six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The truck stops will identify it from the stop sign.
The best way to get along is to get off the stop at Otkaar, Otkaar, on stop number 1.
The bassist of the Mocoma unit fell off the stage in the middle of the job and was hurt.
On its website, the Mokoma Association will inform you of the surprising situation with the Tampere Pack Room job.
The solo show in the Tampere Packroom gave a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell from stage to stage in the middle performance.
The situation happened when the band was pulling the last song last night.
The spider's wrist was broken.
The band will inform you about this on its Facebook page.
"I'm in trouble!"
Santtu tripped off the stage in the Packroom at the last song and broke his wrists.
Let's hope for a quick improvement for the metal brother.
The rest of the tour's works are done by Vice Presidents, on the pages it reads.
Mokoman fans are very concerned about the image update where basist-Santtu is sleeping with a cast in his bed.
This news has been expected, it was pretty hard to worry about how bad it happened.
The relief is great, the bone will heal, fortunately, over time.
Double and quick recovery for Santu and a good tour of the rest of the band, plus for a tortoise!
And thanks for last night, there was a great gig, but you promise me you'll leave such strong dramatic gigs out of the way?
Police were in charge of hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting controls on Friday and Saturday with Metsähallitus and the Finnish hunting centre in northern Karelia and Ylä-Savo, the police unit’s unit officers reported on Saturday in social media.
The main focus of surveillance was on the legality and authorisation of hunting.
Each hunter was inspected for a hunting card and a hunting permit required by the state.
In addition, the holding permits for hunting weapons as well as the quantities allowed for self-loading weapons used for handling canteens were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection, and only one hunters met with a required hunting licence were required in the course of the inspection.
The hunter was sentenced to 12 days' fines for illegal fishing.
In addition, the police suspended 133 vehicle drivers, and two of them were suspected of having a wheeled ride.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic offences in the fine procedure, police times.
In conclusion, the hunters are very good at respecting the forestry permit.
A lot of hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
A hunter noted that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting monitoring in autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
The mobile will go to Turkey to monitor the choice of Syrian quota refugees to select Syrian quota refugees.
Minister of State Kai Mkänen (Kok.) will be travelling to Turkey in the coming days to follow the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
It has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from the refugee camps in Turkey this year.
Elections usually take place a few times a year, involving representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, and the police.
The delegation is already having interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organisation, UNHCR, first of all, selects people with particularly vulnerable conditions.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly difficult situation in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick, women and children.
The future group in Finland is selected more people than the quota is, because in practice part of the group will not arrive for different reasons.
I also call on the Turkish Minister for the Interior to act as non-governmental organisations operating at the Somali border and at the Syrian border.
Ilkka Salmi is also involved in the journey.
Speaking of raising the quota,
Finland has taken quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1,050 per year for a couple of years, but since then the government has not agreed to raise it.
The meeting has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has last fallen to the blue resistance.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) has recently presented a gradual increase in the quota to between 1,500 and 2 000 people per year.
The visit of the mine is the first to be made by the Minister for the Interior to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
Former Minister for Internal Affairs Petter Orpo (Kok.) and Paula Riskko (kok.) will be able to move on to their new missions before the visits were organised.
Finland receives €10 000 from the EU per particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now, let's go for the hacks, you don't know whether to cry or laugh anymore.
Last Saturday, a card from a bill of law to change the legislation on animal health.
The article took the view that the draft law basically prohibits any animal, pet or other business in respect of the holding of all animals which are not allowed separately by the ministries' regulations.
Thus, in principle, everything else is prohibited except those referred to in the Regulation.
If the bill is legal, it should mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits action which jeopardises the safety of society or good practice.
It is now in principle to prohibit any action to which the law or regulation does not specifically authorise.
This change causes that nothing new can be tried, for example, in business activities or anything else, until the law or regulation which it adopts has been adopted has been adopted.
In general, the government's activities in lawmaking have been weak.
If we go now to the road that, from the outset, everything in Finland is prohibited, which is not allowed separately, no longer knows whether to cry or to laugh.
I don't doubt that the Animal Health Act would require an update.
However, the legislative project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I am not familiar with the Constitution very well, but may it accept such a procedure as 'all is prohibited, which is not permitted by law or regulation separately'.
I hope there is a reasonable minister who will suspend the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell tip: Sysy's four most trendy skirt.
This autumn's trend view comes in snake holes.
It looks very good just in the skirts.
Connect the snake-like skirt to the sharper upper parts, such as the pole or the normal t-shirt, so that the population remains stylish.
This autumn, the silk is visible in abundance, and especially the silk skirt is one of the trendiest clothes in the season.
Put together a wonderful silk skirt with a fine top of the woman’s top, or relaxed on the needle.
You can play more bravely with silk teeth and throw on your feet, for example, dressers or autumn trend shoes with cowboy boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's grey, brown, or multi-faceted, all the square-part skirts now belong to every woman's black hair suit.
Frightfully connect different colors with each other and play with the square loop as well as with different upper parts of the square.
For example, the combination of the grids and your spheres is beautiful.
The non-symmetric beads are a blast of summer light that can be taken with them into the autumn.
A non-symmetric pearl is the same womanly and playful and is fine for both the everyday and the festive.

Kim Räikkönen crystals the reason for Mercedes's improvedness compared to Ferrari compared to Ferrari, Kim Kimi Räikkönen.
Ferrari Kim Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor in Mercedes was too hard a piece of Russia's time.
However, there is no reason to lose weight in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimates.
They were just faster than we were, but it's not about something huge.
Our car was the best weekend we've ever had, but they were just too fast, the fourth time we drove and his stable mate Sebastian Vettt and his friend, Sebastian Vettt, clearly left with the Mercedes speed of the Räikkönen said.
Ferrari's been having a hard time since the last race in Singapore.
They asked why the sudden fall of Mercedes' ride was right.
They seem to go faster than we are... so simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, we would probably go as fast as they did.
However, I don't know any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was rare taste for Sauber in Räikkö’s future stable.
Charles Leclerc, who was replacing Ferrari for the next period, was the seventh, and the last time-space mission was also served by Marcus Ericsson.
The tenth slots for the Swedish race are the best for more than three years.
And while five drivers left behind in the second season, the result was still delicious for Saul.
And, perhaps, encouraging to the sun’s future mind will be encouraged?
Yes, if you compare it to where they were from the beginning, then step forward has been a big step forward.
There's a different story next year, so let's see.
It was there - Robert Helenius tyrässi Erkan Teper: "Robbe is back"
The match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper at Stuttgart's night was held in equal signs.
German was in the ring with more initiative, but he couldn't get a good shot at it.
Helenius, which is clearly more advanced, controlled the match with its hard-to-gauge series, which found well-founded.
Finnish was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution came finally in the eighth round when Helenius fell on his left right Teper.
The hit was so hard that a con before the audience wasn't even trying to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius was feeling rather moderately.
In his discussion, he first commended the good feeling created by the audience and his opponents.
Then he switched into Finnish for a moment.
Thank you all for watching and Finnish encouragement.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the fight.
It was a very big victory for Helenius' career.
It might be possible to get even to the MM match, Helenius commented on the evening paper before the match.
On the other hand, you could've ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's come to mind.
This is not gonna be any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before his encounter with Teper.
The number of victims of Indonesia’s disaster could be multiplied by multiple increases in the number of victims of Indonesia’s disaster.
According to The Guardian, the Vice-President of the country is urged to prepare himself for the apparent rise in the number of victims.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims may rise to thousands.
Severe circumstances
Rescuers are looking for remains in the trap, as well as dead people from the worst affected areas of the island of Sulawes: Please call the port city and its neighbourhood from Donggala.
So far, all victims are from the Ask, the situation in Donggas is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing, and about 540 have been hurt badly.
There are still people in the rejected buildings who the rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, a hotel named Roa in Palu has fallen apart.
Rescuers tell me that they heard the screams of people trapped in ruins, but the lack of a grubbing-up ship has delayed the start of rescues.
In Indonesia, President Joko Widodo has ordered an army for rescue and extermination.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and communications are across many places in the disaster zone.
The fuel supplies are also expanding.
Miss Finland - a vague response and long reflection caused a laughter-remamaka.
In Billnäs Ruuksi, a new Miss Finland is currently being elected.
A round of interviews was a question put to each missionary.
The finalists took the question of the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the final number of six Emilia Anttiikoske, 23, the suspicious response received the presence of the audience with sweet, but good-looking laughs.
The question put to Anttiikos had come through Facebook.
The user of Pirkko-El wanted to know what the latest book she's read by the missifist has ever read.
I was wondering if you'd come up with a good answer before you started suspiciously.
Thank you for the question, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read... Anttiski told me to think.
In the audience, a period of alarm was reached by the laughter mill until Anttikoski continued to respond:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books at school.
Probably something related to economics.
The last book I've read was economics by someone, Anttiski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski was given the audience a pretty good laugh.
In the past, Anttiikoski gave attention to the fact that he did not want to pose in underwear because of his principle.
The year 2018 Miss Finland is crowned at 21 a.m. when the crown is abandoned last year Miss Suomi Michaela Söderholm.
Siken apple pear cake takes the tongue away from her.
This recipe is for you who have good, acidic apples for your own protection, for domestic apples are in store for shocking prices.
The pear may have to be bought, even though quite a lot of people already know how to grow that pear tree.
This cake can also only be made from apples if you don't want to buy a pear.
Of course, the taste is more diverse if the cake also rains its pear.
The peel of apples and pears and the seed beads are to be removed.

According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a framework for unique written experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts from the popularity of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or beautiful?
The researchers of the University of Sydney have outlined two slightly different types of "coolidity" consisting of different features: generally attractive school quality and, to that end, the opposing dissident-cool.
In a pleasant way, people had many socially desired features described by researchers: they were outwards, friendly, agreeable and qualified.
On the other hand, the dissidents had a typical distance, independence, rebellion and adversities.
They were thirsty for their experiences and only a few of their external assessments.
Both types combined good self-esteem and a stable emotional life.
The long-term role of hardship is not cool: a high status teenage age may not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what Child Development magazine says in 2014 about American research published in the United States.
Young people who were dating early, partying, looking for good-looking drills and looking for other people's favor were at the risk of growing up in adults using drugs and thinking about crimes.
In their sexual relations, they were more vulnerable than ever before to their more noticeable agemates.
The high-ranking locks of cars, brands or clocks that communicate high-end do not make people cool or, at least, genuinely attractive company.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science magazine in August, most of the people were more prepared to make friends with their regular label shirt than with their branded shirts - despite the fact that most people chose a signboard when they first met.
If you're on a Greek holiday, watch out.
There's a storm of terror attacking a weather warning call from the red light.
During the weekend in southern Greece, there may be as much water as in Finland as in average over a half-year period.
The Zorbas Fear storm hits Greece during the weekend in Greece.
Take care if you are in Peloponnus, the Joona Islands, the Kyklates or the Kreeta area.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Athens Embassy reports it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the Greek aviation service has given red weather warnings to the regions.
The nearby storm is also reported in the Forecan blog.
According to it, the storm's most severe hips are up to 45 meters per second.
For comparison, from the beginning of the week, the tearing of the Kuusma storm blew up at its toughest fairs in 31 meters per second.
According to Blog, however, the biggest concern in the Zorbas storm is not wind, but heavy rains.
The weekend in South Greece may be more than 300 millimetres of water.
It accounts for about half of Finland’s annual quantity of rain.
The weather service Sever Weather Europa has shared the video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods to Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize the death of men Love Island Finland -Anku?
There's going to be a confusing Youtube video that shows up with a youtube video.
Rarely knows that in the Love Island Finland series several men’s drool beauty Anku is also present in strange films published in Youtube in 2010 as an Ascendants.
On video Anku advises ascarers, among other things, to prepare for an old paper roll in the blue field.
Anku also appears to have a sympathistic style of how to pick up a wing with tights, a wing for which the right tights grow.
Now we're making Easter grass grow, but let's do it a little bit of a surprise, Anku suggests and presents sawdust, pantyhose, and rosemage seeds from which he makes a wing.
You can watch videos from the bottom or from Ankun Youtube channel from here.
Valtter Botts stared and bit adrenaline in Sosh, did he have to help Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtter Bottas sprung a little more than ten minutes after he was in front of the media.
A fine round left Lewis Hamilton the first star of Mercedes and was certainly vital to the Finnish collector who gathered this season.
Nice round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left in the middle of the round.
I'm having a good time, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been on a boat once this year, in Austria (medium), so time has gone pretty far.
This track has been good to me before, and I got again some good tours.
It's not easy to miss the Sothhi track, so the departure is particularly big.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the question as to whether he was going to drive tomorrow to win or whether he was facing the World Cup in the coming of Hamilton.
My starting point for the race is definitely trying to win.
There can be no other goal when leaving the dam, Bottas.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis' leader Sebastian Vetteli is quite a big one and the difference between me is very big, so it's keeping in mind.
We'll see what happens, however, Bottas has perfected it.
Hamilton was truly happy about the success of Bottsten, and the stable boss of Mercedes Toto Wolffil also tasted it.
Lewis had a plan to win Valtter, but he couldn't make it through the block.
Valtter knows that he has to tear out everything for himself to win Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline bit out of his ears, Wolff suffocated.
To ask if the stable of Botteks and Hamilton was wrong, Wolff was reluctant to answer.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kääläinen Erno Kinninunen reached the race of the Finnish Championship of Rallen Finland.
The SM series of racing cars was rarely completed.
Never before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
It was now done in the decision-making line near Turku and Salo, by Eerik and Henrik St. Petersburg, when Eerik won the SM1 and Henry SM2 categories.
Käläinen Erno Kinnnunen confirmed the best achievement of his career when the third place of the final race sealed him from the SM4 category of double-hulled cars of the Finnish Championship.
Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Honvi, started the Turku event, because the starting points were clear: the top group of investments guaranteed the SM title.
In the dark of Friday night, the twin had to give off when part of the extra lights was betrayed by another special test.
It's got a little bit of shock in it, and it's a third bit.
In a situation like that, you don't fit yourself with a shuffle.
On Saturday, only a second series was followed up on the speed of Jussi Tepo, Kinnunen told me.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops and withdraw their troops from the United States, France and Turkey.
The Syrian Foreign Minister is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Mualam says that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Mualam said that foreign troops are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists he said "it's almost over."
In his UN address Mualem also appealed to Syrian refugees that they would return to their homeland.
However, there is no end to the seven years of war.
Over 360 000 people have died in war.
The Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that by October there are plans to meet Syria, which would take part in his addition to the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans were looking at the TV from the highest court-lined TV in the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, and Professor Christine Blasay Ford, who accused him of harassment, received exceptionally many people near the screens.
In the United States, the appointment drama of the Supreme Court judge with full effect took at least 20 million people on Thursday from his TVs.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump, and the California Professor Blasay Ford, who accused him of being accused of being accused, was a story that was told by the Senate Legal Committee in front of his story.
According to the preliminary findings, the consultations followed a total of 20,4 million viewers with six main channels, ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to their online consultation, several million more were monitored.
NBC told me that the livesters were followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that he had made a record of 8,2 million live live broadcasts during the start of the year.
CNN's number will rise by more than 10 million, according to the number of people who have been following youtube and Facebook broadcasts.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million start-ups.
Digital startups are the own of channels, TV check numbers are derived from Nielsen’s research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final readings on Monday, but they are in any case peaks.
Rarely, 20 million to 20 million million.
More than 20 million viewers are usually available in the United States only in sports games as well as major Oscars and Grammy Games in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential speeches and presidential election elections in 2016 as well.
Of course, there's a trip to the US's most visited annual show, the American football league's NFL final match at Super Bowl.
This year Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel near the squares.
Last year's first speech to the Congress by Trump was taken by Nielsen, according to a total of almost 48 million people and officials, fair 30 million people.
That's a top priority thing.
The name of the Supreme Court is an extremely significant case in the United States of America, since the posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalal died in early 2016 and Republicans managed to prevent this kind of President Barack Obama from appointing his successor.
Another place opened up when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed president of the Republican President, Ronald Reagan, but he was on several issues in so-called 'same language', whose vote might have resolved the position of the 9th - century court.
He was a supporter of abortion law and sexual minorities' rights, for example in 2015 with a vote that same-sex people received marriage law throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than it is.
The highest right of his choice may be to lock the right to conservative sovereignty for decades.
The child has the right to have children have the right to have access to parents' parents and parents and parents have the right to have access access to the parents to have access to the parents and parents.
Parents of children under 10 years of age will see the health data of their children from the Canta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation in the Canta service was, of course, even more worrying: parents could not even look at health information or prescriptions for young people.
The situation was temporarily characterised by a correction in autumn 2016 for persons under the age of 10 years.
After that, the practices have been promised to be repaired, but the repair has taken an amazing long time to repair.
The correction is now in agreement - 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change in the legal basis should not have been more than a breakthrough.
After that, the country's understanding is about the pressure of the button: when the door is now closed, it is opened.
A child may, of course, show his or her parents his information if he has a bank ID or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds do you have?
Card's paid, and bank ID's not even getting a 10-year-old.
So, in practice, data from secondary school are not accessible to anyone except to request that they are printed.
It's not as much about parents' rights as about children's rights.
It is extremely important for the child to be treated so that parents can be involved in it.
Of course, the right of young people to privacy must be taken care of.
Even minors can have family situations where there is no freedom to talk about all things.
Often they are related to sexual health, of which freedom of care is deeply concerned with human rights.
In the United States, the F.B.F. started the F.B.B.B.B. in the U.S., in the event of the attack of Kavanaugh.
According to US media, the FBI will investigate the harassment charges brought by at least two women.
One of these women was before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the accusations concerning alleged sexual harassment during his studies period.
The United States President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the accusations at the request of the Senate Legal Committee.
The settlement must not take longer than one month.
According to Washington Post, this is a case investigation into a limited investigation, and it may not be publicised.
He threatened to kill police police officers at the police station in Kajaan, Kajaan, Kajaan.
The tied destroyer continued the bulldozer's work.
The police are telling me that they put a man in a police prison "rest calm down".
The police got hit by a suspect in Kajaan on Saturday night in Kajaan, Kajaan, on Saturday.
The Authority will inform about the case that started when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a fierce dispute at the central restaurant.
The man abused another client first within the nutrition movement.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by taking him down on the ground.
When a third party tries to intervene, he still hit him.
Three-hospital investigation led to a call from the police.
The police caught him and took Kajaan to the police station, and the police will tell you.
The suspect was still aggressively aggressive in the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and abuse the police.
The police are telling me that they've signed a man's police prison to "rest calm down".
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition from an official.
Assistance organisations are preparing to start work at the Indonesian Sulawes - "The water is the most urgent thing".
UN Children's Organisation Unicef and other international non-governmental organisations are ready to help on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, reports Kirsi Haru, Finland's Information Centre Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading rescue workers, but the need for additional assistance is already obvious at this stage.
Unicef works in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programs in Indonesia.
Besides normal operation, Unicef always has full emergency response, says Haru.
The first task is now to find people from ruins, survivors and dead.
In the city of Sulawes, rescue operations are under way, but in the Donggasa region a little more norther than the situation is more unclear.
There are still places where connections don't work.
The assistance measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The buildings are often light structures at Sulawes, so the damage caused by earthquakes and tsunamis is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection first, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent thing to do in crisis situations.
For the first time in humans, it is mostly possible to provide water treatment tablets, which Unicef also has in storage.
Water systems are designed to be repaired as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, water is transported primarily by trucks, for example.
In crises, many children get rid of their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification are part of the mission of Unicef.
Food aid will be organised again, among other things, by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of the UN.
In the initial phase of emergency aid, the funds previously collected will be used.
However, Unicef has already started to collect money to assist the Indonesian earthquake and the victims of tsunamis.
Billion Lord Elon Musk will cease as Chairman of the Government of  Tesla - a fine of $20 million for the Twins of $20 million fines.
Founder of space and electric cars companies Elon Musk avoids fraud charges under an agreement with the US Securities Commission.
Mr. Elon Musk will end his duties as Chairman of the Government of Tesla and will agree to a fine of $20 million.
As part of the contract he entered into with the US Securities Supervisory Authority, the Musk will be excluded from the task.
By agreeing Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Muskete's securities fraud because of the Twites he sent in August.
In them, Musk wrote that he was preparing an electric car company to withdraw Tesla from the stock exchange, which led to the rapid increase in the company’s stock exchange rate.
According to the agreement, Musk cannot be elected Chairman of the Government of Tesla for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" of its Government and take on board two "independent leaders" of its Board of Directors.
Tesla must also establish a committee to monitor Muskin's communication.
The Musk can still continue as the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to the personal $20 million fines of Muskin, the Tesla company also has to pay 20 million equivalent fines to the financial supervisor.
Thewiitts led investors to a false misbehaviour.
According to SEC, the Muskin Twiitts have led investors and Tesla shareholders to misbehaved.
The Musk claimed that he would have guaranteed funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange into a private limited company.
According to billion TWITS, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange at a price of $420.
The stock exchange rate in Tesla rose by more than 10 per cent a day after the twits, but decreased later.
According to SEC, Muskin's claims had no basis at all.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his alleged funding.
Nor had he discussed the stock exchange withdrawal with the other management board or company board.
On Friday of this week, the rate fell by 14 per cent when the SEC, the supervisor, reported a fraud charge.
The new agreement is expected to reaffirm the company's course.
The final judgment is not the reason for the final conviction for the final reason for the final conviction.
Of course, the bells in the court don't ring when wise people don't move.
It's a technical mistake.
The time has stopped for the tower of the Helsinki Court of Justice has stopped.
The wisers show at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like an average horror movie: while the church's crypt is a matter of management and the guars eat themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it is broken.
It's happened to the repairer, but some of the parts are broken and are expected to be a new part of it," says Eveliina Jamsen.
The same Jamsen confirms the Church in Helsinki - Twitter account that I already mentioned.
In fact, it is mentioned that the last sentence is not the reason why the watch is stopped.
Jamsen tells me that church bells don't call for trouble.
