European inflation has slipped on food.
The accelerated inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
The increase in the price of November in the euro area was higher than expected in 13 euro area countries, after 2.6 percent annual inflation was recorded at 3.1 per cent after October - reported by the EU Statistical Office for Luxembourg.
The official forecast was only 3 percent suspected - the Bloomberg reported it.
The European Central Bank (ECB) did not, unlike the US, British and Canadian ticket banks, cut back on the ground, saying that the reduction would lead to a rise in prices of raw materials and inflation, together with mild unemployment.
The ECB is under 2%, but it wants to keep the inflation rate close to that.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the twenty-two traps, "we need to talk" about inflation so that it does not later have to act on this subject.
In Germany, the rate of November inflation is 3.3 per cent as a twelve-year record; Spain rose from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent in Spain.
Euro-zone inflation has been cut high by rising food and energy prices.
The time-limits for wheat increased by 88 per cent, and the exchange rate for soya beans has reached the highest value since 1973.
Also, there was a considerable increase in the cost of oil and milk products in 2007.
The world oil market price increased by 52 percent this year, and in the last month it cost almost $100 a barrel of black gold.
According to the ECB this year, inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 inflation will fall to 1.9.
It is estimated that the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3 per cent in the next 3 to 4 months, but the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent.
However, they expect the ECB to reduce its interest rate twice during 2008 at the same time.
He sees a government crisis in the Gallup.
After a long stagnation of Fidesz's support, he grew significantly at the beginning of December, so since 2002, he has now had the largest camp, while Gallup has not yet measured such low socialist support of 13 percent.
The difference between the Commissioner's parties - because of the greater determination of the opposition voters - would mean more than two thirds (71 percent) of the support of the MSZP one-fifth (20 percent) support.
According to the survey, MDF and SZZZ are below the Parliament's threshold: their eligibility within the entire population is two per cent.
Among the Commissioner's voting parties, the supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The economic public opinion could continue to deteriorate to this point - it has never been this high, 41% of those who were considered to be very bad in the country's economic situation, while another 46 percent of them were quite bad.
The change in the family's financial position after spring and summer's more hopeful prospects are now again judged as a pessimist.
For the following year, the majority of the population will suffer further deterioration and only a tenth improvement.
In December, more than every previous survey of Gallup, 71 percent of the people asked thought that the Prime Minister was wrong rather than doing his job well with the Prime Minister.
In Ferenc Gyrücsány, 13 percent of the people who were asked trust or trust, while Viktor Orbán has 38 percent of the number of supporters.
In the Prime Minister, 54 percent don't trust him at all, 27 percent in the President of Fidesz.
An indicator of the evolution of the political situation is that what part of society thinks it can be treated with dissatisfaction with the prime minister without change.
While 35% of the government and the Prime Minister wanted to stay after October last year, this ratio is now only 20%, while the relative majority (33%) sees only the solution in making new elections.
The interest in referendums is that 60% of the people who were asked to make a request to participate answer the question that he would certainly go away and another 20% say that he would probably go away.
As a comparison, only 55 percent of the parliamentary elections to be held on Sunday would be sure to take part and another 15 percent would consider it likely to take part. The result of the referendum would not be a question on the basis of what has been meant by the recent intentions.
For the tuitions, 74 people, 79 for the quartet and 84 percent for the hospital daily fee would say no to no.
Only if we look at the same rates among those who promise to make their participation in the referendums, then 81, 84 and 89% of voters would remove the introduction of fees, fees and hospital daily fees.
The most expensive of Auchan, almost the fifth, was raised by the Tesco Tesco.
In the Budapest trade triangle, hypermarkets held an average price increase of 16 per cent last year, with the difference that the VAT did not rise this year.
The Article of the Day Economic Article
This year, an average 16 percent increase in the Budapest trade triangle was recorded in the normal Christmas basket of the Sun, but each hypermarket showed a much over 1000 HUF increase in value.
As last December, the prices of food stocks have already taken off, a percentage of the sharp drop in prices was no longer demonstrated by comparison with the previous high base.
However, it is clearly shocking for consumers that what they received last year under nine thousand forints is not yet available for ten thousand.
The daily basket in the examined hypermarkets crossed the spiritual limit of ten thousand forints with the least 91 forints.
And the highest basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, 6800 HUF was added to the basket).
Unicum and living fish prices were almost on last year's level, but the turkey juice, nuts and masculine are very expensive.
KSH's data was followed by the price of flour and bread in the stores, although we found a pound of bread in Auchan for 139 HUF.
The competition did not print the price of the product below 200 HUF.
Also, it was surprising in this business that the price of the two-litre reversed bottle Coca-Cola was below 200 HUF, so with a deposit fee they asked for only 257 HUF for the product.
This year, however, Auchan showed the most expensive of the sun's baskets this year, while Cora was the noblest.
It is estimated that in comparison with Christmas prices last year, Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased prices by around 18 to 18 percent in the Napi basket.
Compared with last year's most expensive and this year's cheapest basket, the difference was 12 per cent, while between last year's coldest and the year's most expensive, it was 21 per cent of the increase.
In Forint, the average increase was 1480.
Last year's average price increase was reached at 1206 forints, so that last Christmas had an impact on prices of VAT rises.
This process has just been disrupted by trade, apparently they have not been able to decide how much price they would apply to one product, because they were unable to calculate what impact the price change would have on consumption.
(If a product's rotation rate is wrongly planned by the trader, there may be significant benefits in terms of the price adjusted to traffic intensity).
Because of the VAT, the price increase in the sun’s basket was so extreme last year that the most expensive 1720 HUF was more than the 2006 value, while only 844 HUF was the difference between prices.
This year, this extreme has not shown itself, as the most expensive 1630 HUF was more than last year, and the cheapest one was also 1284 forints.
Compared to the two Christmas seasons, disastrous price increases have decreased by more than 30 per cent over a period of less than 20 months, the daily consumer goods in hypermarkets have decreased by more than 30 per cent.
(This does not necessarily justify KSH's data: the statistical office's price increase over a 12-month period of 12 months for some basic foods is higher than 30 %.
Like flour, for example, with eggs.)
According to the daily basket, this seems almost impossible since last year the price level of a relatively expensive product compared to the base has produced a price increase of less than 10 per cent in the worst case.
The flour suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than eggs, the dramatic price rises in several have been reversed on several occasions.
In the trade angle, hypers do not complain, they keep reporting for a good year.
According to our experience, the number of customers in the three stores visited is no longer of interest to the prices.
They buy a lot of everything, they land on a platform, they take the sustainable food.
In the morning of Wednesday, all three of the stores have developed serious lines in front of the money prices, because suddenly the number of visitors has increased.
However, there are several complaints from research firms that even his plans are not only for food but also for long-term consumer goods.
In many places, it saves money for disinfectants.
More than a thousand infections have been registered in hospitals this year, which have been mainly caused by inadequate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the abundance of beds, the overload of staff do not favour the prevention of infections, claim the head of department of the National Epidemiology Centre.
They save money in many places for disinfectants.
Recently M.R.SA infection has been diagnosed in the traumaology department of the János Hospital.
In a man who was in a serious accident, an antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been detected.
The patient was separated.
Similar infections occurred at the beginning of the same year.
A serious car accident was released from the hospital, but soon thereafter, he had to return with MRSA infection, and his major surgery has not been able to perform any of his major surgery ever since because of the bacteria in his body.
This year, between 10 December and 1094, hospital infections caused by multi-resistent pathogens have been reported to the National Noscomial Surveyal System, said Böröcz Karolina, head of the National Epidemiological Centre.
This means that all the infections caused by multi-resisted pathogens must have been registered in hospitals, not knowing about the rest of them.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. the resistance of methicillin-oxacillin to Staphylococcus aureus.
The bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) are carried by one third of people without having to carry their noses to cause disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. inflammation of the throat, meningitis, inflammation of the skin, infection of the skin) are well reacted to antibiotics, can be cured well.
However, if antibiotics are over- or inadequately used, a bacteria that responds to antibiotics are developed that are highly resistant to antibiotics, which spread rapidly under inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially when the immune system is temporarily or permanently poor, severe hospital infections, such as ulceration or blood poisoning - septosis, may occur in patients with weak, elderly or low body weight.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, there is nothing strange about MRSA infection, such infections are part of the daily practice of hospitals.
The infection must not be confused with the trip, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where no pathogens are being tested.
Antibiotics are contraindicated for antibiotics.
"We separate these patients, the nursing staff delivers the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," Tibor Nyulasi said.
Patients who arrive at the hospital will be examined first to see if MRSA is present in their system, but this does not always prevent infection.
No fashion for sampling.
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA would be preventable, but the current domestic hospital conditions and circumstances are not favourable to preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant pathogens, claim Böröcz Karolina.
After this infection occurs typically in hospitals, in elderly homes, hospitals should check the patients they arrive, and patients who have MRSA should be separated immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals there is no microbiological sampling in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these investigations.
Most cases thus occur when the patient becomes aware of an MRSA infection, he said he was the headmaster of the epidemiological centre.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the proper use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are domestic guidelines for the treatment of certain infections and pathogens.
An attempt should be made to target antibiotic therapy, i.e. to carry out microbiological tests to prevent resistance to medicines, but hospitals do not always observe it.
Microbiological samples are even less rare in the living or basic care, Böröcz Karolina reported.
saves money on disinfectants.
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA is one patient to the other most frequently spread through the transmission of medical staff.
This is why it has a very important role to play in washing hands, gloves, masks, but there are also significant deficiencies in hospitals.
M.R.SA is exposed to injection and contact, but it is not always possible to separate an infected patient under domestic hospital conditions.
In fact, the clinics were often strung up, often very close to each other, where patients should be at least a half m apart from each other from an epidemiological point of view.
Unfortunately, it is also evident that Böröcz Karolina has noted that in hospitals in disadvantaged financial situations they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses, many patients, so there is even more chance of developing infections.
According to Börcz Karolina, where appropriate precautions are taken, there are apparently fewer cases of such infection or an obstacle to the spread of the disease.
The governance programme against MRSA is a government programme against MRSA.
Management of MRSA infection causes huge costs for health insurance companies, and they fight all over it.
In England, for example, the Government Programme included a reduction in the prevention and occurrence of MRSA.
It appears that the program is successful, based on the data reported, the MRSA infection has a decreasing trend in England.
The priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) include the development of multi-responsive pathogens (including MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by such agents.
There was no drunk in the police captain responsible for the fatal accident.
An official expert opinion was prepared on the case of a fatal accident caused by the State Police Commander at District XXIII.
It is impossible that during his post, the district police captain XXII, who had gased a pedestrian to death on Tuesday night, informed Attila Morvai, the spokesperson of the capital attorney, on Friday after his expert opinion on this matter had been completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the primary study result, which has already established that the former police commander had not consumed alcohol before he was sitting behind the wheel.
At the time of his own passenger car on his own passenger car in the State of Kossuth Laos Street in District XXIII, he hit the 55-year-old man who didn't want to get across the road on the designated foot stop.
(The latter, therefore, that the pedestrian has not passed the zebran, otherwise the unrescueing circumstances according to the rules of the GRESZ, the kanyo car driver must still give priority.)
The pedestrian lost his life after he was sent to the hospital.
Because of what happened, the district police chief has resigned from his position and requested him to rest his duties, according to the police, because he was so shocked by the case.
In this case, the Budapest Detective Prosecutor's Office is conducting an investigation.
Attila Morvai also indicated that the former Chief of Police was working with the investigating prosecutors from the outset.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure infrastructure of EUR 400 million is yet another EUR 400 million.
On Friday, in Budapest, the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), Mr Veres János Finance Minister and Mr Marta Gjecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed an agreement to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which the parties concluded a loan agreement of EUR 100 million earlier, for the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The education-related projects also provide budgetary funding for the EUR 150 million loan agreement.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary, with the use of the remaining EUR 150 million later, with the extension of the loan contract.
A EUR 50 million contract was signed in the field of innovation by the parties, which are mainly used by the budget for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
The 4th subway was also discussed during the meeting.
It was agreed that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the subway with the EU, Hungary will return to whether it is necessary and how the original contract should be amended.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects in Hungary with a total of EUR 8.4 billion.
The loan portfolio shall be provided by EIB without a fee of 8 years of grace and a fee of availability due to EURIBOR.
Bulgaria is the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is amazing - all of Europe is paying attention to the few previously mentioned Balkan countries.
What, where and who are they buying from the EU's still coolest, yet fast-spoiled market?
Analysis of Bulgarian divisions of Re/Max.
The best real estate purchase in Eastern Europe is now undoubtedly Bulgaria, with cheap ski apartments and coastal houses.
Among the mountains is the most beautiful Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa area, and the beach is Albana, "Aranypart", "Napospart", the ancient Sozopol and Neszegar, but more and more are looking for real estate in Kavarna and Balcsik.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country will raise the interest of investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, and more and more people are buying in the well-known cheap Rus.
The capital, Sofia also has attractive opportunities, commercial and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, so in addition to the summer and winter season, it should be a top destination for the other two years as well.
For this reason, forward-looking investors already have large purchases, e.g. around Banszko.
Analysts believe that customers in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and their lifestyles.
Most of the buyers are English, but come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
The Maltese and Cyprus investors are also present, and there are traditionally many Russian buyers on the Black Sea and on the plains.
Foreign customers are classified into three groups - said Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Farmers buy properties or refurbished real estates between EUR 50 and 100 thousand, or covered old houses for 5 to 15 thousand euros, and then refurbished them.
It is important to have good accessibility and communication opportunities, and it is important for them to be close to a large city, shops and a local doctor in general.
The second category was introduced to the shopping mall (in December Bulgaria to the list of the first 10 German destinations).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of medium- or long-term increases in value.
The decline in capital real estate is continuing as demand is increasing.
The lowest real estate prices in Bulgaria are in the European Union, but they have increased by 21 per cent over the past five years.
The rise in real estate prices is essentially higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages.
According to information from the Minister for the Environment and Water, the expert meetings will be completed on Tuesday and, on Wednesday after the formal opening, the ministers will continue to negotiate the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries from the world are discussing the Bali Path Plan, which provides for efforts following the emission reduction period set out in the Kyoto Protocol until 2012.
At present, there is a serious debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not wish to discuss precise numbers at present, although it is inclined to agree that by 2020, the greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 25-40 per cent compared to 1990.
The other major question is whether developed countries are committed to reducing emissions as well as providing both financial and technological assistance to those countries that need it.
There has been an agreement on aid to developing countries.
The grant fund, which is provided for by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a board of 16 members, is expected to be read within the UN Global Environment Fund (GEF) – in Piac and Profit.
Six per cent of Hungary's six per cent.
Mr Fodor Gábor, Minister for the Environment and Water, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to preserve the role of the flag ship in its global climate protection efforts and to facilitate the establishment of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will undertake to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the post-2012 agreement, and will be ready to reduce up to 30% if other developed regions of the world and developing countries are willing to commit themselves to commitments that meet their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997, the total number of countries joining the Kyoto Protocol has been reduced by 5.2 per cent, including the EU - even 15 Member States - by about 8 per cent.
Hungary's obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to the period 1985-87, which our Hungary will fulfil. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of Environment.
High stakes in Bali, as a long-term international climate policy agreement is needed within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be sure to follow after 2012. In this case, the Kyoto Protocol reduction commitments would not immediately be followed by a new international emission reduction system, which is required by the IPCC, the United Nations Nobel Peace Prize, in its latest report on climate change.
This would lead to a delay in emissions reduction and an inevitable increase in the average global temperature of the Earth above 2 degrees Celcius, which scientists believe would have extremely severe and irreversible consequences.
YouTube recruits the British army to recruit the British army.
The British Army units will publish recordings of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan on video-sharing, with which they will promote themselves.
Most recently, the British Air Force (RAF) received YouTube: the special developments in Afghanistan since March 2006 have been filming their Taliban activities - reported BBC.
These miniature recordings will be checked at the Air Force Commander's Air Force Operation Commander and then sent to London, where domestics will upload them to the Internet.
The political message of political message is inevitable.
Air Force soldiers have already recorded 139 footage of them on the Internet in this form and have watched over 75 thousand of their channels.
The British Ministry of Defence registered with the name "defenceheadquarters" in the spring 2007 and publishes videos of both Iraqi and Afghan actions, while the British Ministry of Nationals (Commonwealth Office) and the Iraqi International Peace Maintenance Organisations (NFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Action in Afghanistan
According to the Air Force's original intention to record the videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, this is also good for the public to know the true purpose of the military presence abroad.
The propaganda published in such a form is almost nothing compared to traditional television recruitment records - declared to the BBC the defence expert Gordon Mackenzie - but he also has absolutely some political messages, as it shows in a specific form that military operations decided by the government are valid.
Americans played American games.
The military is also concerned that, in addition to carefully modified, censored recordings, amateur videos are also passed on to the dealer, who, for example, shows the death of soldiers: in the slightly illustrative, "official" propaganda films, officers speak of losses, but do not present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, several videos of Iraq and Afghanistan have already been released on the Internet, which were made for sharp deployment, but the British army has only recently been able to get it.
The Americans are recruiting a little differently, free downloadable American's Army, a shooting game that can be found directly into the soldier's skin within the framework of a more or less life-like simulation.
It'll be a shave and a bakery Christmas at the Ministrys.
The Minister of Labour Lamperth Mónika does not seem to be sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, he will hold an annual job interview with his colleagues, who will be able to provide them with pops and coffee from 2007 onwards.
There's a department where living is going to be a party, having a Christmas mood in the hearts of officials everywhere else with a mound and a coccuding.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and coffee tables - so fun power.
They're getting ready for Christmas, too.
The most customized state-of-the-art Christmas party is held by the defence wallet this year, but HM does not expect state-of-the-art workers.
The children of the fallen soldiers will be given a gift at the Christmas of the Academy, and family members of the soldiers currently engaged in foreign missions will be hosted at the Missionary Christmas, but they will also hold a press conference.
The wallet is worth 25 million for the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NU) and the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport (GM) fires out of the hemp compared to the rest of the wallets.
The GKM's party is held in the next House, of a total of 4 320 000 HUF, and there are about 30 and 50 guests from 500 ministerial workers.
At the feast of the wallet, they will stick to the Christmas spirit, but there will be performers, and there will also be a maze.
The year of the NFU was 4 700 000 HUF, and it was held on Wednesday - concerts and dinners were held in the National Court of Justice (OIT) building.
The room rental cost a million HUF, the remaining part was spent on more than four hundred invitations.
We are aware that one of the NCF's departments is also official for another Christmas celebration: this is managed by a tendering firm, the Hungarian Economic Development Centre, from the EU's funds.
For the purpose, the building of the Vest Theatre has been rented.
The information at MAG Zrt was not confirmed as we failed to reach the competent authority.
You don't need a suit.
The OIT building not only visited the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Administration, which held a Luca Day Ball on 7 December instead of Christmas instead of Christmas.
They did not make money for the use of OIT's services.
Five hundred people attended the ball.
The party started with the minister's welcome, and after dinner, he could dance to live music.
The [origo] question was asked: at the ball, the evening dress or suit was not mandatory at all.
Puritán is having a party in the health, labour and municipal records.
The Ministry of Health organises a show and a celebration for employees for 400 000 HUF in its own building.
Mr Lamperth Mónika Minister of Labour, however, is officially not expecting a Christmas party, but he is looking forward to a year's final job meeting with his colleagues.
They're expecting a hundred and eight guests who've informed the press department that they'll only get coffee and pots, so the party's taken out of 350,000 HUF.
On the other hand, Minister of State Bajnai Gordon will simply cook with his colleagues in the honor of the Ministry of Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is conducting a Christmas meeting in its own large hall, for which 436 workers are waiting.
For 2500 HUF per guest for the Christmas party - the amount is a welcome bet and a cocktail fit in.
Ever since János Veres is a minister, every year the PM employees have similar Christmases.
It is not, however, that the official will not only confirm the Ministerial speech but also the afternoon time.
On 20 January, the Farming Library will give a new year's reception, and the Ministry Christmas is not enough.
The bet is held in Vajdahunyadvár, Vajdahunyadvár, the City of Városliget, and according to the wallet, the hundred guests make up 1,000 HUF per 100 guests each.
According to the press department, this is going to be a very simple standover, which only foreign diplomats who have been accredited to Hungary are official.
These annual bets begin with a short minister's greeting and end with back-drawling.
There is no Christmas party at all for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Education and Culture - notified to [origo] at the competent press departments.
The price of the official Christmas of the environmental wallet could not be said at the press department.
More than four hundred people were invited to attend the party at the Museum of Iparistians.
The strengths of the Masters are becoming increasingly conspired by the power of the Masters of the Powers of the Powers of the Powers of the Powers.
The National Association of Liga Trade Unions and Works Councils will be set up on Friday's Monday's, independent strike strike strike committee.
A protesting assembly will be held on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act - and will begin with the unemployment penalty.
Action in transport will certainly cause a significant rise, as it will almost stop rail and strike for 13 hours at BKV as well.
In the afternoon of Friday, the League Trade Unions will present details of the Monday strike of the work councils jointly organised with the National Union of Works Councils.
The LIGA - MOSZ strike committee will also be established, which will coordinate Monday actions.
There will be a protesting assembly on Saturday, and on Monday, the organizations joining the strike will cancel the work for an indefinite period if they cannot reach agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been designated - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act - the date of the completion of the initial strike.
If the National Assembly did not adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions will immediately withdraw the strike call.
However, if you vote in favour of legislation, the strike committees will sit together and decide to continue.
On the basis of the Parliament's agenda on Monday, it is also possible that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted on late evenings or at nights.
Due to the strike from Monday, significant rises in transport can be expected: work on the railway will be discontinued for an unspecified period, and a part of the public transport in Budapest, more than half of the Volanian companies, may stop in advance.
At the same time, there will also be a semi-field roadblock at a number of points in the country.
A number of trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the strike call and are continuously updating their list on the Liga Day.
Some organisations reported an indeterminate strike, others announced a temporary contract of employment.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Free Trade Union for MÁV and Railway Workers (VSZSZ) could not agree on a sufficient service, but, as the Christmas holidays approached, more and more people travel by rail.
It has been reported that from the start of operation to 13 hours at BKV, Budapest Airport in the morning between 7 and 9 p.m., a four-hour strike has been called for by LIGA Villamos and Energy Trade Unions, 2 or 2 to 8 hours of employment by Pedagogian Trade Union and the Democratic Union of Pedagos.
The Hungarian Medical Association has a two-hour warning strike at national, alternate times, with a two-hour alert strike by the Democratic Organisation of Experts (EDSZ) working in the Health and Social Division of SZEF.
The four claims made by Liga are of key importance for the Government to withdraw the submission on the reform of health insurance and to issue a new concept for a social debate.
The second claim is to gradually introduce a new pension accounting method from the next year.
The third is to ensure that early retirement pensions already have the possibility of entering the scheme before 2010 at decent working hours.
The fourth reason for this action is that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport does not accept the offer of railway routes by the Finnish Railway Workers' Free Trade Union (VSZZ) is not in favour of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Gárda has increased the risk of the country.
The Hungarian Guard's activities, founded this year's August, have increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in several respects according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
The company's "risk warning" said that, in terms of the activities of the Hungarian Gárda, it is the greatest political risk that "with the deepening of existing ethnic tensions between Hungarian Gypsy and non-Nigány populations, even in the short term, even violent ethnic conflicts can occur".
The main reason for this is that the policy strategy of the Hungarian Gárda is likely to be aimed at promoting such an act - the research institute added it to it.
As it has been written, this is due to one of the major failures of Hungarian political actors: "The public debate of Roma has been handed over to representatives of radical and extreme political groups who have built a political strategy against gypsy-Hungarian opposition".
This strengthens the problem, eliminates normal dialogue, reinforces the extremes, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts occurring - they believe.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activities of the Hungarian Gárda, under the influence of the great national and international media attention, have significantly undermined Hungary's image of abroad, notably its belief in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
They recall: from the fall of 2006, it is part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and extreme right-hand groups, which, from now on, became part of Hungary's ever-behaviour organisation, has been founded in Hungary, as well as several organisations called the "national self-defense" association itself.
"The joint engagement of these demonstrations is that they define themselves as a civil society organisation, while they openly announce the preparation of their members - whether armed - for protection (catastrophe, defence, defence of the defence of the defence of the defences, police, the military, or the state's inefficiencies)".
It is noted that this is done in accordance with the method of placing various political aspirations into civil clothing based on the political and parity of society.
Therefore, the emphasis on civil society and the form of association should not only serve to avoid the legal competitors of the judicial registration, but also to avoid a political strategy for such associations.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Gárda is also a risk factor for neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, several neighbouring countries are also referring to the Hungarian Gárda as a potential threat, and the ultra-national political actors in certain neighbouring countries want to demonstrate their own Hungarian policy by reference to the formation of the Hungarian Gárda.
All this affects the political stability of the region", he added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Gárda is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, so the political risks to the region as a whole have increased.
As it was written, the functioning of the Hungarian Gárda is similar, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (BU) of the extreme right-hand side.
In the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roma disturbances that broke out in one of Sofia's quarters (Crasna Poljana).
BNU decided to use this approach to setting up a bridge, saying that the organization aims to "national self-defense".
In the past 17 years, they believe that there has been a "ciányterror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained unsubstantiated and indifferent - it reminds us of the Political Capital.
He added: the initiative has caused a serious debate in the Bulgarian public.
As it was written, there was an increase in the risk of ethnic collisions that some Bulgarian Roma organisations announced that resistance was likely to create their own barrier.
Since the operation of the Hungarian Gárda shows similarities to the functioning of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma are also responding to the threat by organising their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning of the risk of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Political Capital, said to the interest of the telepathic office: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As you said, they issue their risk analysis annually, and if they experience something that could affect the change in risk, they shall inform the public as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
It's not all red letter about the holiday holidays all over the place.
In Hungary, the law clearly identifies the red letter days, and around the holidays it has become a common practice for day-to-day arrangements, which will be less than for the future.
In the EU and America, it is not a uniform holiday.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and public holidays and working hours.
Working days are mostly linked to church holidays, significant historical events.
We are celebrating the new year: the last and the first day of the year is both the first day of the year of the working holiday - the last one to be rested by the sylvers.
We have a total of eleven red letter holidays all year round.
National holidays are the Memorial of the 1848 Revolution of March 15th and October 23th, 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrate the foundation of the state, on 1 May, and on 1 and 2 November we remember our relatives and friends who have died on 1 and 2 November.
In addition, there are two days of Sundays, Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our public, national or even religious holidays are infrequently due to fall on the calendar, working day transfers became a practice in cases where we would only work for one day before or after the red letter holiday.
True, the price of the extended weekend is that on the previous Saturdays we will not stay away from work-to-work school on the previous Saturdays.
The fact that the day immediately before or after the celebration has to be completed is exactly when, for many years, the Minister for Labour has been regulated by a separate regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and employees, civil servants and those in the public service sector.
However, it does not affect the institutions and companies operating without interruption and its intended purpose, as well as service providers of working days.
This year's work schedule is only changed around the end of the year: from 24 December to 24 December, life is almost stopped in the country, as the experience shows that the most people are "losing" or use their saved leave for this purpose.
Next year we will have more holidays in the middle of the week or end, which is why we will have less workday transfers than we did this year.
First, the working day will change the calendar so that workers can remain at home for four days at the same time dependently.
Saturday of April 26th will be a working day to make it possible for you to have a Friday Friday on May 2nd.
The other transfer is linked to the Sunday 23 October: on Saturday 18 October, you will have to work instead of 24 Friday.
However, the end of the year will be the next year at the end of the holiday, as from 24 December to almost every nonstop break will be held on Wednesday of the Year.
Six little things that make you mad at your colleagues.
Emails that we forget to send are voicemail messages that we never receive, innocent lies, which we almost no longer notice: they "color" every day at work.
Ask yourself whether you get used to small inconveniences or wear gloves, and you are conscious of the misunderstandings of others who are causing revenge.
They're tops.
"Bocs, I forgot to tell you that you were looking for the marketing department," said one of your colleagues.
That you missed a meeting?
At best, you are sorry and trying to make amends, or you may call the marketing department to tell you that you forgot to pass the message (this is a less ordinary solution).
Most of the time it's been handled with an apology.
Before making an awkward excuse, it is worth considering what it is that you can make unpleasant moments for your colleagues and make a conscious effort to avoid this.
Can you borrow something that isn't yours?
There's nothing more annoying about when you touch a paper, an office, or your phone, and it's nowhere to be found.
Remember you put your fireman on the table yesterday, but by morning, his foot was on fire?
Perhaps you'll expose one of your colleagues on a desk of your lost pens?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without a request, 'cause they're just gonna get mad at you to ride their property.
Don't put your pocket on office envelopes, post-it because it may be awkward if you run out of time, and you need it right away.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no way to stop the rumors that have spread.
Who, who, did what?
Why? Why why?
Remember to keep your colleagues informed about your privacy, not everyone's face.
If one of them shares your inner secrets, don't get back on your trust.
Bury those who have heard in themselves, and do not negotiate with your colleagues in his absence, even though others also know about your colleague's things.
You're reporting me you're not being ill?
When you call the office, and you report a patient with a gastric headache, because it's bad for you or you feel like you'd rather rest that day; think about your work, your work, your unforeseeable tasks, your future work must be done by someone else for you.
Don't spot me with your colleagues.
If you know in advance that you won't go into the office the next day, or you could intervene in something that will make you stay home, tell me that your colleagues and your boss won't face your absence the next day.
Squiding, raining, calling
Did you get a little involved in the job, but it's hard to drag your colleagues out of it?
You were an uninvited ear witness to a phone call that you would not have heard better than to hear?
Do not interfere with your colleagues with sneezing, singing, loud conversation (which you continue above your head) or footing, continuous dissatisfaction, loud dissatisfaction, and sound dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they are not currently in a process (for writing, design, organisation).
Are you blaming others for their mistakes?
If there's something that isn't up to date, you forgot to send me an important letter, a message, no one else to blame for your unforgivableness.
Do not refer to the possible chaos in the office, your voice-tuning colleagues.
You admit it when you've made a mistake, and it's a disadvantage for someone else, and you're going to have to push the herb out of it.
Ask me how you could make up for your mistake, make up for the failure.
Are you feeling too comfortable in the office?
Maccods and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not available in the office.
You don't want to get comfortable free skins if your job allows you to do it.
Don't be a lamp, your colleagues, and respect yourself with the usual dress - if you want your job, pretty, elegantly - you go into the office.
If you want to answer, you're not interesting anymore.
A stay with the car in the usual breakfast jam.
From the radio, something special is quiet: the sound of a violin that is associated with electronic effects.
I'm going to move the volume up.
The music has become a tempo and the previous sounds have arrived at the bass and then, as a real jewelry, it is associated with a female choir.
The number of Zach Wings of Love is Mr.
Home music life has long not spoiled us with high-quality electronic pops.
But now it looks like there's something different when you're listening to the new Zagar album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, a few new and exciting productions coming from the home digital underground, will slowly change the overall pattern, and while fashioning again the guitar fixture rock, the domestic electropop will also prove: there is new during the Sun.
Zéser took off from Balázs Pécs, and he played himself in Yonderboi's band until, perhaps, because two of the duvets didn't touch a bar, he took his own way.
With its project (Zagar) and music, which combines jazz, electronic dance music, pop elements, but it started to break through when film soundtracks were asked for a trip (e.g., soundtracks).
Turkey's Turkish season).
At the beginning of the smaller clubs, he found a wider audience when he listed their first album of the Wwan2 magazine in 2002 among the 50 most important domestic albums and called Zagar, with Yonderboi's company, to the almost only domestic trenders who think it is marketable in the West.
No doubt Zagar and the band became "trend", but of course no one asked if they were willing to wear the label.
The band reacted as it should be: he made a new, better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, now published, can open new paths for them, although the title itself wants to create continuity with the initial pécs years.
For this was one of Zőser's old orchestras there.
We would be on the spot with the flying, flying reference, but, in addition to the sound of the music, we have just noticed, in accordance with the spirit of the age, the higher guitar, the rock and roll effect.
In these songs, George Ligeti showed himself in his millennial premiere of the record, the singer who is currently working with The Puzzle band in England.
The album was also produced by a real radio slager, a newly-newly popular music by Mr.2 Petőfi, who started to sneak into the ears with six Hungarian singeres ("underground Divas") recorded by Wings of Love's great songs.
So everything is fine (?).
Vavg.hu asked about Lake Zéser.
hvg.hu: This new hit now raises the question: how much is left of the layer you're playing?
Balázs Zéser: The definition of layer music does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of light music cast; not adstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but a comer and honest.
The so-called alternative underground music can be flat, non-retardant and can be made available for sale only, which makes them communion.
But a good pop can come up with an honest start.
The reception platform also operates in this spirit regardless of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Can you see the difference between music and music in the audience of Hungarian and foreign audiences?
Zs.B.: In foreign countries, especially wester from us, the light music has larger traditions.
There aren't just the 18-six-year-old concerts, but also the older ones.
They are more careful about the changes in the music around them, because they are also considered part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: Of course, it feels good that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we never made music on the market.
We have music not for purpose but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather noticeable at concerts, where the impact is already working on each other, but this is only reflected in unexpected changes in the moment.
Yet, I realized that if you want to answer to the audience, you're no longer interesting from that point on.
hg.hu: How do you plan to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working on a solo, and instead he's built his career west of us.
Zs.B.: We're not really in his way, regardless of their sometimes trying to explain this to our music.
We're more of a team player who trust the other one's musical presence and let it break out.
At first, of course, it was inevitable that our works were compared to Yonderboi's music, since more of us came out of his band and went on another road.
hvg.hu: On the top of Mr.2 Petőfi, Wings of Love was the first place to be found.
Many people have heard the name Zagar for the first time in this number.
Were you consciously opened with a more popular style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit and sell the record with it.
This song is about more than just me.
We were meant for the album file, which we were trying to solve on the record until then, the audio orthodontics and the more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they - what was the control?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel-like choir.
That's when the idea came of putting this choir together from our own home music scene from a good voiced soloist.
That is how Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], who was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the song exactly like this or is it made by girls?
Zs.B.: The number has long existed in an instrumented version, and then when the data was assembled, we thought that there was something else that we needed to do with this number.
The second point was that my voice would come to my attention.
That night, I sang up the song that the girls later learned.
Almost the first time and the whole thing came from a scary point of view.
I remember he was very fascinated at that time, but of course, they needed to add the Dears.
My voice wouldn't have worked that hard with me.
hvg.hu: Both the record and the concert seemed like the girls were in the background.
No solo (except Judy Jay's short solo), they don't have their own roles, they sing completely together and they're not louder than music, so music does not just accompany their song.
They were back on the stage, too.
Is that deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back was purely because of technical problems.
But it is conscious that we didn't want to share solos.
The number is also about forgetting our ego a little bit about where he came from, just letting those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which were the most work done?
Zs.B.: Not really with any of the musical creators, but with more difficult pieces than mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play for a tournament, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to work for long, and then slowly everything was in place like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Which one of your favorite numbers is yours about the new album?
Zs.B.: This is constantly changing with the concert and by "I let" the record go.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
The traitor risked billions because of the smaller feeling of the traitor broker risked the risk of a minority feeling of being a traitor.
It's disgusting.
The owner of the Czech commercial bank, the French Société Générale bankerism, is called his employee, Jerome Kerviel.
Because of the fee, he lost almost five billion euros.
However, it seems that not at all, not at all, Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to catch up with his colleagues.
Unlike the rest of the bank, he acknowledged in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"It was a little intellectual," he said from his officers who called the police.
However, as stated by France Lemonde, Kerviel's statement shows that at the end of the last year, he earned a profit of EUR 1.6 billion from his stores.
Changes not only in America, but also in America.
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," she says in her statement.
In summer, it was during the US crisis that he managed to earn half a billion euros.
Because the possibility was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, there were news that there would be problems with the so-called subprime mortgages for low-income customers or clients who had been in the past who had problems with payout problems.
However, this crisis should not have a negative impact on the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe in that and put me on a good horse.
The profit of the end of the year reached EUR 1.6 billion.
"I didn't know how to report it," admits Kerviel and says that he didn't keep anything for you.
In his statement, he admits that he faked his reports by not finding out.
He was also able to fool his bosses, even when the Eurex stock exchange began to have an interest in his transactions.
The risk was a gain.
Were you afraid to find out everything?
I'd rather not.
"I thought it was the fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank to calm them down."
Where did you get that much risk from?
He achieved his position gradually.
After completing the University of Lyon, he worked for the Société Générale Bank from 2000.
His annual salary amounted to $51,000.
Two years later, he was a broker-assistant, and he became a self-employed broker in 2005 with an annual salary of $90,000.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never make as much money as others.
"In 2005, when I first talked, I knew they were looking at me in the wrong eye.
For my professional and personal development, too," said Kerviel to the detectives.
The first great success was a long time ago after he got here.
Thanks to Allianz's shares, he was looking for half a billion euros for the fall of these shares in London's bombings.
And it started off as a lavin. He wanted more.
As long as you stay here, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a balloon," he told the police.
But his chiefs were supposed to know everything, or they'd rather have known.
"As long as I was making money, I lost eyes."
Only a blow occurred at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
He wanted to pee in the middle of January of the weekend.
When he went to work on Monday, he stopped working at the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros.
And how did they figure it out?
He became suspicious about his freedom.
"I've only spent four days in the last year.
The broker who has no freedom is a broker who does not want anyone to look into his reports," said Kerviel.
The possibility of obtaining Czech Republic 365 billion dollars was a chance for the Czech Republic's acquisition of 365 billion.
The Czech Government ministers signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, from which the Czech Republic may obtain EUR 14 billion (approx. approximately 365 billion) in the coming years.
It is about half of the total amount available by the Czech Republic from Brussels from 2007 to 2013.
In the regions, it costs approximately 125 billion of the seven operational programmes.
Czech companies will be able to raise around the age of 100 billion from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most money, 150 billion kronors, is directed at transport.
The Transport Programme represents the largest operational programme and accounts for 22% of the funds available to the Czech Republic.
These funds will increase the state base of the Transport Infrastructure, which will be based next year at an age of 90.8 billion.
The Business and Innovation Programme will help entrepreneurs and companies to gain the tools intended for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also obtain resources for the introduction of new technologies, industrial research, but for the introduction of more efficient methods of organisation.
The Czech Republic is among the least successful in obtaining funds from the EU funds so far in the new countries.
The Court approved the sentence of the Court of Justice of 20 years in prison, which was given the sentence of 20 years in court, of 20 years.
On Thursday, the European Court of Appeal approved 20 years of imprisonment for Arnold Alemán, the former President of the country, for which 100 million dollars were sentenced in 2003 (at a maximum age of 1.8 billion) for financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and house arrest in his army near the capital city.
Whether this Central American country's former leader from 1997 to 2002 is back behind bars again, according to the AP news agency, it is not clear yet.
According to Ileana Perez, the President of the Court of Appeal will depend on the prison board whether Alema's sentence will be suspended at home, or whether he will go back to jail.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemale that he regularly referred government funds to accounts by foreign companies in Panama.
These political companies and their account numbers were, in reality, related and closest supporters.
He then made some of these funds at a foundation, which he founded on the financing of his election campaign in 2001.
They have approved our budget for the budget. They have approved our budget.
That's right.
They accepted the state budget.
What makes this budget special?
This is the first budget approved by a coalition majority, composed by this government, with no support for the opposition.
This year he went through with the support of the social Democrats last year, as Minister Sobotka and the Czech Social Democrats could not accept his no-one.
Unlike the mistrust of the government, before the vote, there was no drama at this time.
The House of Representatives has generally ignored this law, although it is the most effective law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governance starts and ends with each chapter and item of the budget, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of politics, but it is hidden behind the fight against the government and the opposition's power.
This is more grateful for the press, which is why you will receive much more attention in the media.
Policy debates are much more interesting to the public than mere numbers.
The state budgets of the past Social Democratic Governments have fought for three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot resolve at the same time:
The first of of of them is the high proportion of the compulsory, so- as trust expenditure law, which is not only a pension, but also a social benefit, approved last year by the silent 'colegation' of ČSSD and KSČM, which was approved before the elections before the elections before the election, and before the election before the election, the silent 'commitment' of ČSSD and KSČM and KSČM, was approved last year before before the election before the election before the election before the election before before before the election before before the election before before the election before before before the election before before before before before the election before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before the before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before before
The second is the result of the first failure as a result of the deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, i.e. the deficits in the budgets of cities and routes.
However, the greatest risk is not the deficit of the state budget.
This is public and relatively controlled.
The timing bombs are deficits in the budget of cities and streets.
Many mayors, apart from taxes, taxes and bank loans, can also buy money for other investments, often mainly issued bonds with which their urban buildings have been disproportionately disproportionately disposed of.
In recent years, these debts have been cancelled by the massive sale of shares in energy and other distribution networks received from the State from privatisations.
Right now, they don't have that kind of source.
If we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we conclude that:
Like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a period of growth that continues to praise the Czech Social Democratic Party for a few years.
This was a unique opportunity for its governments to make public funding right.
Instead, the country has increasingly been put into debt.
The rest of the world has been more reasonable than in the Czech Republic with two exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan and Egypt.
This is mainly the huge shame of previous governments.
We belong to countries that are the least threatened by poverty in a global scale.
For example, there is no need for major social programmes, which have, unfortunately, just in recent years have been completely superstitiously affected.
Although it has been possible to close this year part of the illegitimate populist expenditure approved before the elections, even if there is no way in which retirement is going to take place in the near future and the pension reform, any policy in this country is actually going to end, and whoever governs, this will be just a matter of office.
With a little overdue, the majority of taxed money from the governor's politicians tend to become mechanical distributions of income and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but can only stop the budget being cut off by the trustees of normal expenditure.
The 70 billion deficit planned for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if the previous governments had not sold everything that could have been done over the past decade.
If we do not really want to be mere officials from the governing politicians, then we must be patient and calm in order to prepare for further reform legislation is not too strong, a well-known coalition government that the state can only give out as much as it can from taxes and taxes.
This only makes it possible to achieve a balanced budget gradually.

Banks want to solve the crisis.
The central banks of the US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in financial markets.
Financial markets are thus cost more than $1 billion over the stock exchanges.
On stock exchanges, interest rates are raised on the bank for which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will make 40 billion dollars available to the stock market, and another twenty-four will make the European and Swiss central bank available to the European and Swiss central bank.
Following the 11th September attacks, it is now the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed on a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest problems facing the economy, i.e. the growing lack of free capital that could be given to banks," wrote his clients from Bernard Baumohl, the Economic Outlook Group's advisory firm.
"The coordinated action of central banks in the United States has reduced the likelihood of recession from 65 to about 50 per cent," added Baumohl in his report.
Banks in the United States have already lost $60 billion for unrepaid loans in the United States.
Eminors expect even more billion losses.
"The central banks may indeed fear what might happen if they have decided on such a procedure," said Kieran Davies, the prime minister of ABN Amro.
It seems that it really is a bad thing," he added.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficulty in accessing loans, they will also give their customers loans more expensively.
This would reduce the need and the American economy with potential consequences for global economic growth.
The central banks have decided to fail to reduce the inter-bank supply rate in London, which is used in the inter-bank market for money lending, i.e. LIBOR.
This meant that banks were constantly afraid of mutual money lending, despite the fact that the US, Canada and the UK central banks also reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have a similar effect to the additional decrease in interest rates," said Reuters news agency Greg Salvaggio from Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not consider that the steps of central banks contribute to the resolution of the crisis as they do not solve the underlying problem, the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: An incredible debate between the ecologists.
Global climate change is the main threat to developing countries.
The president, Mr Klaus, once again spoke about the problem of global warming.
This time he criticised the International Conference on Climate Change held by the United Nations in Bali.
The book Blue, presented in Vienna, not the green planet, has said that the debate of the Ecologists is incredible.
According to Klaus, the structure of the conference is not only unacceptable, which is a special mixture of representatives of governments and civil society organisations, but also a fundamental difference between the rhetoric and reality accompanying it.
"There's absolutely no barrier to the structure, it's only to drum words, which are the replacements of solving the current problems," Klaus said.
In presenting the book of the Czech President, he stressed that it was very important for his subject, which is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction that the book would appear in German translation, as he said, "I'm often meeting with the caricatures of my opinion."
Therefore, interested parties can now read their untroubled opinion.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he felt that he had sufficient grounds to write such a book on condition.
Since he has been able to monitor and evaluate his studies as an academic expert, he has also experienced statistics and economists as well.
At the end of the book, the fact that the climate is constantly changing, that is to say, its changes are normal, and there is no agreement between all scientists that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and severe, so there is no danger and the efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
In addition, as a man with experience in the field of totalitarianism, the use of unconfirmed opinions to others is considered unacceptable, which is perceived as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
To these questions, he repeatedly explained that "not against reasonable protection of the environment, but against militant enviromentism, which does not take into account the link between costs and benefits".
Klaus has already spoken about similar topics in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand thousands of people couldn't replace their licenses.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and could not replace their old license in time, which ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can apply for an exchange, so that the agencies will be able to issue a new licence in good time until the end of the year.
However, after the new year, the Ministry is not afraid that a hundred thousand drivers will leave without a valid right to travel.
According to the agencies, the licence was primarily not replaced by those who don't want to drive anymore.
While the outbreaks are a sharp fall in interest in the exchange of licences, the capital offices have been flooded with applications for the exchange of licences for which interest has increased this week.
The headmaster's office receives about 2,000 customers a day.
It's supposed to be about half an hour.
In Prague, the license was not replaced by around 140000 drivers.
The issue of a new licence will take 20 days.
However, the new licence may be applied for by a five-day short-term deadline.
In such cases, the driver must pay an additional 500 years of age.
Drivers who are unable to make the compulsory registration by the end of the year and who are on their way with an invalid validity are in danger of being punished as of January.
The guilty person must pay up to a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police may, however, settle the offence by agreement.
In the event of a administrative failure, the penalty shall be 2500 krona.
On the basis of historical information received from the city hall, you can obtain a fine from someone who doesn't travel anywhere.
They say you can pay up to 3000 crowns.
The Ministry previously called on the agencies to be ambitious and to impose penalties of up to a thousand crowns.
However, according to Karel Hanzelka, the minister of the Ministry of Transport, there are no tens of thousands of fines that threaten anyone.
He believes that a licence is a document where people can decide whether or not it is possible for them to decide.
This is not a personal ID that everyone must have.
Those who don't want to drive now should be told of the driver's license.
I'd like to take it enough or mail it to the appropriate agency.
Licences issued between 1964 and 1993 are no longer valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers should gradually replace other types of licences.
Those with documents between 1994 and 2000 may be replaced for another three years.
Licences issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire only in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million additional documents.
The court has reduced the sentence of the detectives of the Berdycchechel cooperatives.
Joseph Opava and Petr Koňaåík were police officers suspected of being conspired with David Bertych's criminal conspiracy, who were sentenced to 13 years and ten years of imprisonment.
The Supreme Court of Prague has determined that one of them has thus reduced their penalties for two years.
Detectives of the Prague Organization Crime Division originally threatened 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's decision, but a review can only be applied to the Supreme Court.
Although Berdychet is also suspected in this case, he is only waiting for the first judgment.
In other proceedings, a total of more than 16 years has already been punished.
He can't have it anymore.
In January, the County Court found 19 persons guilty of taking part in kidnapping attacks, of which 16 appeals were before the Supreme Court today.
The majority of the defendants rejected the accusations from the beginning of the investigation by refusing to issue speculation cases.
According to the Central Czech Senate, police members, after an agreement with Berdycche, have provided information to criminals from police sources, cover each robbery and help the gang to avoid criminal liability.
That's why the gang gave 30 percent of the robbery to Opava and Koňa.
This is about the crimes of the gang between 1999 and 2001.
It is mainly a heist whose victims have often suffered serious health damage, but also about abuse of the civil servant's rights and non-approved records.
Since the police found illegal weapons, steel-fired guns, laser beams or machine guns during the search in the Houses.
The gang's accused of looting several tens of millions of crowns.
In this procedure, the courts of almost 20 gangs were already legally guilty of other robberys of Berdych and many others.
Other members of the Berdych environment will testify before the court even in other proceedings, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The first trial has so far prevented Tomáš Putat and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial detention in Ireland, where they are waiting for a final decision on their release to the Czech Republic for criminal proceedings.
Number for child replacement: 12 million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million million
For children who have been replaced with maternity, the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, from the hospital in Tñebíč, requires 12 million crowns for a premium plus court expenses.
For mothers, three million, two million for fathers and one million for children.
The hospital offers up to 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondñej Dostalvez Veleba, essentially disagrees with his proposal.
"We reject this kind of claim because it's too much," said Dostal after today's trial.
"In order to form an opinion on the opposition proposal, we need an expert opinion developed by the opponent.
Let's see if there's even a value that can be used.
But we maintain our view that this will be measurable in hundreds of thousands of people," Dostal stressed.
According to him, the amount should move between 100.000 and 200.000 Kč between four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Yabloňov family wanted a million crowns for every month until he raised his own biological daughter.
His brother was awarded a fine for the expert on the basis of compensation negotiations, which was developed by the Motol University Hospital in Prague.
According to psychologists and psychiatrists, children’s parents have suffered various degrees and depths of spiritual harm and stress.
The stress situation was better taken by men, even if they met with such eye-sucking that they did not stop the new baby-switching.
Women are having a worse time dealing with the practice of the trauma they've had, and with what's happening right now, they're putting their content together.
Veronica and Nikolaa were replaced by sisters from birth in tñebíč on 9 December.
Last week, children returned to their parents in the blood - Nikola Čermák in Pïibyslavica, Veronika Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jabloňov.
At the end of October, Vysočina, Head of Mission of Miloš Vystrčil, gave families 100,000 crowns to replace them with the expenditure resulting from the error of the hospital in tñebíčské, which is controlled by the process.
All hospitals in Czech Republic have compulsory insurance against the requirement of the law.
In the event of a mistake, they must reach the reserve base and, exceptionally, may request the founder's assistance.
The courts have so far approved relatively low compensation for the people, the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, exceptionally a few million-year-old tables.
Polkka lost her kingdom of Vikasko.
Bolek Polík has lost his case at the address of the Kingdom of Vágsko.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Court, although first he used the name of the king of Agarchi, the project was developed by a team around Tomáš Harabash working with many years of work.
Policy has not been involved in the trial today.
However, according to his legal representative, the case is unlikely to end and the client will appeal.
"The debate is that Mr Harabish and his team are living in the popularity of Bolek Polivika," said Polivka's lawyer after the trial.
He believes that, in the words of the Kingdom of Valachi, everyone thinks of an actor-commic.
This opinion is also shared by Harabish.
"It's almost ten years old work behind us.
Seeking money and making up action," he said.
He thinks the reason for the debate is money.
"In a long time, they realized that the project would succeed and win something out of it.
They want to live from our work," he added.
Futurer business business
According to the court, the name of King Valach was first used in the television programme by Polikka.
In 1993, Radoslav was crowned by Brzobohatý.
However, at that time, it did not relate to the purpose of building the Fleaving Kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing TAVAchi passports.
The original studentcsíny activity was developed into a business and profitable entrepreneurial activity, followed by which Harabish founded the creation of a society of the kingdom of Vakssko.
In 1997, with the consent of Poliveka's consent and signature, it was recommended to visit her farm and theatre performances in passports and even their owners' discounts.
Who takes care of the throne?
The judge mentioned today that Harabish only used the idea that Polkka used to make the press public.
"Boleslav Polivika's popularity helped the project of the Kingdom of Valachi," said the judge.
However, he added that the soul of the project was Harabish and his team on that intensive issue.
Today's cooperation with the interested parties continued until 2000, when he organised an official co-existence of the Harabish Polika in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there have been a series of discussions between Polkávka and Harabish, which have been hurried to "the desolate of King Boleslav for ever" by King Boleslav.
In the Kingdom the leading role of Harabish was taken over as Jarmila Šulákov as a mother queen at the initiative of Harabish.
In 2002, Polivika Harabish and Others filed a court case against him, which the court refused today.
The battle planned by Harabish could bring fire to the debate for the throne and for the half of the queen.
This fight should be a new king.
He didn't want to tell you the details and the timing yet.
"We don't want to catch anything.
It's supposed to be something like Slovácko's royal outcome.
The King should be chosen for a fixed period of time.
Mr. Polkáka may be happy to come," added Mr. Harabish.
207 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: excellent prejudices.
To be honest, I never liked Peugeot 206.
His lost properties are nothing special, the quality of the change, management and production can often be considered below average average.
But the offspring already present on the market, Peugeot 207 is significantly better.
And the combination called SW goes further than one degree, so for me, there's nothing left left to think more of than think about.
When I tested Peugeot 207's classic sixchback, for example, I complained to the head in the back seat.
This time, this complaint is over, as the combination's bodywork means that in this regard, the two-metre-high giants are no longer suffering.
It's oxygen in the world. It's oxygen in the world.
I'll get through the inner space soon so I don't repeat myself many times.
It's a relatively good idea, where my only excuse is for the poor console.
Here, I'd appreciate a little more designer inventory, even if the car's appearance is so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and where are the times when we appealed to the short side of the seat or to the arms.
The lateral driving was also significantly improved against the 206 model.
As far as the space is concerned, there is also an increase in the size of the bodywork.
The combination then disappears with a small space mentioned in the head.
I'm keeping my skin skins in the trunk in the trunk in the trunk in the trunk in the trunk in the trunk.
So the main vehicle is the package.
This is very well available (even thanks to the driving back window) and should be assessed as a spacious size.
The empty spaces are equipped with seal tyres, which are ideal compromises.
They're not on the road, they're stretchable, and they can handle harder objects at the same time.
But let's stick to the volume for a while.
On the basis of these tables, the Fund is set at 428 l, which is more of an average value compared to competition.
However, in the Czech Republic, it is not the most wanted vehicle of this class - against Skoda Fabi Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation product of mladaa boleslav, then we conclude that Peugeot is likely to fall well behind a lot of 52 litres.
This value is already almost critical in the case of a foreign holiday or a baby car.
But if I have to highlight the positives, then I have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the second row backrest down or the very low threshold.
120 lbs in four rows
The vehicle we tested was equipped with four cylinder lighter engines with a capacity of 1.6 l, with 88 kW power.
And to tell the truth, that's how it should look for the thousand thousand years that drive family sixchback.
It's quiet, it's small consumption, and it's mostly a pull.
If we compare it to Škoda's supervisor, which often seems to have been a lot like a bunch of rags in his exhaust, I can only be happy for that.
The price is too high.
Car car prices are not cheap.
We should remember, however, that we were testing a car with a spacious inner space and with a very good engine.
The car's still leaving for 329 900 Kč with four-wheel motors.
The car begins with 410 990 Kč, which is already quite large.
The tested Premium equipment is equipped with an additional 80 000 Kč.
Only if we even have head-to-head bags, automatic climate, automatic window wiper start, back windows we also had electric remote control....
Which means the car costs 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but calculates Fabia's supplemental equipment, and it's getting very similar results.
So there's nothing left but a choice for the brand.
The integration of Slovak students in British schools has failed to be successful.
In British schools, more and more children from eastern Europe are concerned about the further development of local school activities.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing many obstacles to the integration of Eastern Europe.
British schools have already registered cases of violence between the children of immigrants and native residents.
The problems related to the integration of children from Eastern Europe are well illustrated by a case in the north-east, where disputes between their seats and Slovak immigrants are increasing.
Exchanges and ties between learners are already linked to parents' relationships.
The situation was so far that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who spoke to a ten-year-old student with a iron rod.
The guilty is defending the boy from insulting him with racist mouths.
The police had to go after two 12-year-old girls attacking Slovak immigrants.
The girls say that the man was shaved with racist comments and dumped with stones.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop doing this, he hit us with apples and nails, and then he revealed his naked butt," wrote the mother of Slovak students in the new unpleasant case to The Times.
There are complaints from both sides.
One of the local residents identified disputes about immigrants from Eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
The above mentioned cases suggest that in the UK schools, the mood between locals and immigrants is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70,000 job-seekers are reportedly employed in Slovakia.
About 30,000 Slovak students go to British schools.
Cuba is the most beautiful island of the Caribbean region.
For visitors, it is indeed an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be accomplished if you choose correctly.
The gold and white coasts, high waves or sea, are calm as a fisherman.
Plums and all inclusive with waiters on the beach offering pizza, ice cream or mammoth cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in a full and even more rich list.
However, on an island you can find even more, and this is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island of the Great Antiques.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was the elder of their American conquerors.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place that human eyes have ever seen.
Havana has become a treasurer and a transilator, which the Spaniards have kidnapped and transported to Europe in America.
Next was the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the late 20s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, built it, because everything that was considered a crime in the USA (mainly sistolism), in Cuba, was welcomed and supported by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among example, among others among some some include visitors.
Winston Still, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, towers were built, cars traveled on the wide-range routes of the 50s of the last century became a symbol of cultism for the years of the 50s.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, not far from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio wooden is decorated with the signatures of the stars and politicians of the American showbusiness.
And today?
You can carry the wall of Bodeguita in Havana with your card.
The expensive Nacional Hotel bar has a cocktail they want for you.
And today, the 50s cult cars are flying in Havana, as the once exported chips and boys in this salty and wet air have been rotting long before.
Although most of Havana's oldest part is greatly laxed, there are nowhere else in the area without as many beautiful colonial monuments as it is right there.
Other places are becoming increasingly beautiful, such as Trinidad.
In view of the fact that tourism provides the necessary money, the development of the green road has been improved.
In the last 15 years, not only new hotels were built in Havana, but also in Varad, on the coast of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique tendon in the world, which is primarily appreciated by train-owners.
Out of their widespread plantations, sugar cane was delivered to sugar plants steam and motor trains.
Their motor parks have not been renewed for decades, so the machines operating there are visible, which are already seen in museums around the world.
Where do we go?
Most visitors to Cuba will not miss the most known places.
So there's no need to write too much about Vader or Havana.
Let's just remind you that there is a museum on the Hemingway sheep mentioned earlier, and whoever loves the writer, who doesn't misses the visit to this museum.
One of the most picturesque parts of Viňales Valley Cuba is the western part of the island.
The stupid vegetal is growing from a slaughter.
The soil formations, honey-bows and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their shells have grown up into a fertile soil, which also causes the broken vertebrates to be covered by dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet at the visit of a tobacco factory in Havana.
Some may also find it interesting that there was the episode of Major Zeman's Chilei's episode.
Trinidad
An ancient city, founded shortly after the colonization of the island of Spain.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought fame and glory.
The economy filled its body in the beauty and monumentality of the non-great city.
Over the four centuries, the colonial Spanish architecture, which had had a significant impact on the later French settlers, has changed almost nothing.
Trinidad is such a distraught place between the plains and the sea of Escambray that even in the 50s of the last century there were no roads that would link this region with the rest of the country.
The particular isolation helped to stay outside.
They didn't build anything there, so they didn't break it down. Everyone was happy that there was a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon of Trinidad, you should look at the places you've got around here, like the beach of Playa Ancón, or the valley of the Sugar market.
And tonight it's convenient to go to Casa de la Música, which, after dark, you come back where music is only quiet by morning.
Baracoa
Some of the cities in the eastern part of Cuba are considered the most beautiful city.
Surely this opinion has its own influence on the road itself.
Both roads from Guantanamo have to fight high and divided mountains, and they are passing through a relatively affected nature by human activity.
Thanks to the unspoiled nature of Cuba, UNESCO has entered the World Heritage List.
The best chocolate is made here, the cross of Columbus in the church (a hundred years after the shipping of Columbus in reality) and the hill where the former castle was standing and today the El Castillo hotel stands, some of which are the most known El Yunque.
Of the coffee, rum, cigars, Sierran Mestro plains, the Disnos Bay and the Island of Iceland de Pinos, the Tropicana cabare, the Port of Cardidad del Cobra, the Santeria, the African religion, which is believed to be the successors of the former slaves, a lot can be written about it.
That is, as you say correctly, better to see once.
Afghan allies are passive, claim to be Americans.
A few soldiers and a lack of equipment are also affected by the course of the US mission to Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should outline concrete plans for the coming years.
The Afghanistan mission does not take place as a matter of idea, agreed with the leaders of the countries of Scotland in Edinburgh, which have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition of the Taliban movement, eight participating countries also discuss further plans and coordination of allies.
While the US Minister of Defence Robert Gates has been calling for greater activity this week for NATO troops, the United Kingdom considers the Afghan Government to be a priority and to strengthen development assistance.
"Afghanistan development can be justified, but military forces can only be part of the solution.
The other to enable the population to start further development of the economy and security itself," said British Minister of Defence for Des Browne to BBC.
Ninety percent percent percent percent percent percent percent percent
Afghan ascendant activity is reported to be the strongest in the last five years, according to the US government.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 per cent from last year and by 60 per cent in the southern province of Helmand.
There are about 40,000 soldiers in NATO countries in Afghanistan, approximately one quarter of them in southern areas.
However, according to the United States, the Allies reached their borders in the organisation and equipment of the troops as well.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts were specifically requested to train Afghan troops.
"We need to think carefully about the specific goals for the future and how we can achieve them," Øekl Gates.
In a similar spirit today, Jaap de Hoop spoke to the NATO Secretary-General, NATO.
"I'm not glad what's going on in Afghanistan on earth and in the air.
About 90% of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's not enough," said Reuters News Agency De Hoop at the end of the three-day conversation with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Out passive
There are also discussions between the participating countries in recent months as to whether all all all all all all all all all all allies are providing the fullest in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticised for its passivity.
"The Germans are relatively large numbers present in Afghanistan.
However, they were introduced in areas where the least violence and combat requirements are so not as high against them as against us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," said Gates.
The Sun British tabloid this week called German soldiers lazy.
"The Afghan Suns appeared: The Germans are playing while our sons are fighting," wrote Sun in a material supplemented with the photograph of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into a counter-attack and published a photo of his rögmics in the southern part of Afghanistan from a British team.
The state debt will reach one billion in 2009.
All the Czech Republic has a debt of 88,000 crowns.
By the end of September, the total debt reached an age of HUF 842.7 billion.
The government is planning to raise a loan of $15.9 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced this plan by a age of EUR 152.8 billion, thanks to the improved development of the state budget.
At the end of September, the Czech Government's debt reached the age of HUF 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year, this increased by 40,2 billion people.
From June to June, however, it decreased by 13.4 billion people.
Thus today, the Ministry of Finance proved its state debt data from the beginning of October.
There are more debts in each Czech Republic than at the age of 84.000.
Last year, the state has taxed more than 11 billion people.
"At the same time, thanks to the lower deficit of the next year, we can only go beyond the one-Billión threshold in 2009.
The next year, the debt will move around 900 billion and a billion pounds," said IHNed.cz Server Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly you can see this Next Finance analyst, Vladimír Pikora: "We can cross over a billion dollars during 2009.
That exactly when, for the time being, it depends on the next budget which is unknown to the moment.
If it were to prove that the situation would change in the field of politics, politicians would be willing to save more money, which could happen until 2010.
But I don't assume that change was going to change," he said.
Growth in debt growth
Government debt is a central government debt which is primarily formed by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The government debt is financed by bank notes, state loans, direct loans, or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's domestic debt has now increased by 38,5 billion to an age of 719,4 billion this year.
Foreign debt has now increased by 1.7 billion to HUF 123.3 billion.
By the end of September of the so-called sold sovereign debt, it decreased by HUF 803.3 billion and by an increase of EUR 13.7 billion from June to June.
The average debt rate increased from 6.5 years to 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt increased by 13 per cent in the first quarter, which is indeed very much compared to the progress of the economy.
Interestingly, the rise is primarily generated by loans where the rise is 20%.
It is bad that the debt is a woman, but on the other hand this shows how to trade when the pension reform will be here," said Pikora, who commented on the data.
You got to make yourself happier than this one.
The funding strategy and the management of the public debt in 2007 show that the government was planning to raise a loan of $15.9 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by a age of EUR 152.8 billion, thanks to the improved development of the state budget.
The amount is mainly a deficit of the state budget, which is likely to reach 76 billion krona this year instead of expected to be 911.3 billion kroons.
In addition, it is intended to provide a maximum of 13,3,3 billion krona, a 10 billion reserve for the payment of pensions, a financing of the 43 billion krona of public bonds and a cancellation of loans worth 1,8 billion kroons from the European Investment Bank.
The teacher today appears before a cardum court because of a name given to a plyssmack.
On Thursday night, a cardinian court sentenced the British teacher to 15 days of prison and removal from the country in Sudan for the violation of Islam - she informed her lawyer about the violation of Islam.
The British woman was accused of allowing her 6-7-year-old students to call me Mohammed. However, Islamic religion prohibits any representation of the prophet's character.
Such an act can be punished by a coercion.
The 54-year-old British woman, who was a teacher of the Budapest High School, was arrested on Sunday in her own apartment. On the basis of paragraph 125 of the Sudan Penal Code, she was accused of violations and rebellion of Islam after several complaints were made by the students' parents at the Finnish Ministry of Education against her at the Finnish Ministry of Education.
The story began in September when the teacher asked her students aged 6 to 7 years to choose the name of the class's plysmack.
"The children were proposed to have eight names: among them were Hasaán, Abdullah, and Mohammed," says the school director Robert Bouulos.
In a vote of 23 children out of 23 chose the first name Mohammed.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the prophet Islam, but also a very common first name in Sudan.
The kids then made a joint diary with the Mac photo and "My name is Mohammed" sign.
The problem is rather that the illustration of the prophet is an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons, a colleague of Muslims at the same school, told me that he knew him well, and that the teacher would never have done anything to violate any religious beliefs. He said it was just a "infidel error": "I'm sorry that he voted with the children."
Many of the teacher's students agree with this opinion, and they think the teacher "is very well treated with the children" and "though she doesn't speak about religion in the class".
Let's not forget that the second most popular first name in Mohammed Great Britain is also the second most popular first name, and in English there are 14 different ways of writing.
This often chosen first name by Muslim families is one of the ways of expressing respect for the Prophets. (The first child of the family is called George.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Is that a name, for example, a game?
That is obviously a question of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province during the last Vienna trial in Wednesday.
End result: failure.
The discussion between the Serbians and the Albanians in Kosovo on the future status status of the sixth and last of the Separatist provinces was completed in the morning of Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria.
"It is unfortunate that the parties have not reached agreement on the status" - declared Mr Issinger at a press conference in Vienna.
The American ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was at the 'forg stake' and encouraged Belgrade and Pristina to keep their promises to maintain peace and dialogue after the negotiations.
"In the near future, no violence must be held, but it is a very difficult period", he added, stressing "the existence of obvious tensions".
The mediation will end on 10 December 10 December.
On Monday, the European Union, the United States of America and Russia, will be the last to visit Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the Albanian province of 90 % may be clarified after Issinger, Wisner and the Russian broker, Aleksandr Bocan-Harcsenko, will report to the United Nations Security Council by 10 December.
The meeting held in Baden near Vienna has announced the sixth and last session of the negotiations since the UN has again commissioned the Troj by means of a second transmission in August last year.
The Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation mission will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians who have already failed Kosovo's independence in the Security Council maintain that the negotiations should continue after the deadline has expired.
"Russia was committed and remains the negotiating solution, in favour of the compromise," declared Bocan-Harchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
Once Kosovo was under the control of the United Nations for 8 years, Western powers believe that independence under the supervision of the EU is the only viable solution.
Pristina has announced that she will be prepared to express her independence unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide for her benefit.
Belgrade would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Sajnos has failed to reach an agreement" - declared the President of the Kosovo independent province, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel where "the trial of the last chance has taken place since Monday".
Hashim Thaci, former Commander of the Kosovo Uprising and the future Prime Minister of the Province have also expressed their regret.
He added, however, that the idea of Belgrade's autonomy is "the continuation of a history of murders and deportation."
"Domino effect"
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, considered that the compromise was still possible and that the Albanian majority in Kosovo was warned about the consequences of unilateral expropriation of independence.
Belgrade has 'domino effect' because of the war on independence in the 1990s, it is still in a unstable region.
"For Serbia, this does not exclude the possibility of compromise", said Tadic.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again stated that the decision should be limited to the Security Council, where the Russian Federation has the right to veto.
"The final word for the Kosovo Parliament will be the final word."
"For Serbia only the solution approved by the Security Council is acceptable", said Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica, Prime Minister of Serbia.
"The negotiations have been held for two years.
They must end the same place where they started: the Security Council".
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that "the final word will be the Kosovo Parliament". He added that the unilateral expropriation of independence by the Albanians is based on the "agreement" of Western powers.
Bush calls for an agreement between Israel and Palestine between Israel and Palestine. Bush calls for an agreement between Israel and Palestine between Israel and Palestine.
On Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israel and Palestine finally agreed to sign a joint declaration.
According to Bush, the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Ehud Olmer and President of Palestine agreed that Mahmúd Abbas would immediately enter into negotiations with their peoples in order to finalise the 60-year-old debate.
Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, promised to support them in every possible way so that they could sign the peace treaty in 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must eliminate the "terrorist networks" and Israel must withdraw its colonial activity - declared Bush and reminded the two parties of their obligations regarding the " Peace Plan" adopted in 2003.
The President of the White House stressed that Abbász led the Palestinian Authority and Israel to negotiate the objective of 'the signing of a peace treaty to settle all the problems that are dependent, including central issues'.
The latter concern the three delicate problems that lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestin debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees who have been displaced from their homes during the 1948 conflict, who have lived in the territory of the present state of Israel.
Abbász, who spoke after the American president, insisted that future negotiations be "global and profound" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusm, asylum, national borders, colony, water and security".
Then Olmer made a promise that the future negotiations would be "public and ongoing" and he would try to "end up until 2008".
By the end of 2008, Bush set out the implementation of the "viso of two states" of Palestine and Israel by the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has said that Bush had a promise to do this before he decided to take part in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (recorded as the successful participation of Annapolis in Washington) has launched a plan with the support of all Arab countries that will guarantee peace for Israel if he withdraws from all Arab territories during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis "an answer in the history of the Middle East, especially because he is at the root of the problem and focuses on central issues", says the Prince of Saudi in his interview with the Saudi Arab newspaper.
According to the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened Sunday?
As is usually the case with news of this kind, the official position and the rumor are against each other.
How was the accident?
According to the first data of the investigation launched by the National Police General Control Body (IGPN), on Sunday, a police car moved to Villiers-le-Bel on Louise-Michel Street a few minutes after 17 hours.
"The car was on patrol, so he wasn't involved. He's gone 40 to 50 km/h without a siren." We found out from a police source.
The two unbundled young "high speed" was driven by a green, "not registered in the official register" (see below) with a brand-type engine of Kawasaki.
"By not complying with the right-hand rule, the engine hit the left side of the police car," says a cop.
The result of an alcohol test on the passenger of the vehicle was negative.
The strength of the impact is well shown that the front of the car is blocked, the windshield is crushed in the shape of the stars, and the bumper is depressed.
In an extraordinary announcement yesterday morning by the Public Prosecutor General of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, he announced that IGPN and Val-D'Oise County have been entrusted with the investigation "initiated for failure to commit murder and assistance".
During the afternoon, the prosecutor told me at a press conference that the responsibility of the police at the present stage of the IGP investigation could be excluded.
According to the prosecutor, the witness who questioned the accident three Sunday nights confirmed "the police report, which says that the robot arrived relatively fast on the left side of the police car".
Yesterday, a track, which was undoubtedly pulled by the footmen on the road, showed that the two vehicles were broken and went together for a while until the police car was able to shut down.
The vehicle has been reserved for technical inspection purposes.
In the body of the two victims, yesterday, a medical investigation was carried out yesterday.
What happened directly then?
Last night, the rumor was that the police quickly left the scene without providing assistance to the two young people.
In this respect, IGPN is a cautious statement, but it does not rule that the police would have made "any serious mistake".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which is even more thorough investigation, and it takes more care" - we found out from police sources.
The Renting met a witness who reported a few minutes after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the scene.
"My cousin, a hospital nurse, we went down immediately to try to relive them," says the witness.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed "a cop who was totally confused and hurt me.
The other two tried to relive one of the young people, and the fourth was on the phone."
The tension has increased among those present as the hopeless situation of two youngsters has become apparent, so incoming police officers have moved their colleagues from the scene by car.
We also know from the witness's announcement that the ambulance "was about 20 minutes after the police left".
They used heart massages, but they didn't.
"I wouldn't say that the police didn't try to help young people.
Young people were given help.
Firefighters arrived immediately at the scene.
They've done everything they could to save them" - the D.A. stressed.
Female tension in Pakistan.
On Monday, Pakistani police prevented the first demonstrations of emergency status introduced by General Musarraf two days earlier.
According to witnesses, about two thousand lawyers in the eastern part of the country, in Lahore, against the measures imposed during the emergency situation were injured by tear-off bombs used by police forces.
In response, they dumped the police with stones, many of whom were injured.
At least 350 lawyers were made.
Similar events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the police attacked and wounded lawyers.
They're making more people.
In Islam, his registered attorneys of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and protests about the arrest of some 500 opposition members, human rights fighters and lawyers during the weekend.
Monday morning, in order to prevent assembly, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed.
There were several protests in Multan and Peshawar in the northwest of Peshawar, which lie in the central central region of the country.
Since Monday, the movement of lawyers has been supported by the powerful Dehida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, which has been conspiring with the religious parties.
"Mussarraf's promise is no longer valid"
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the exceptional measure notified on Saturday night.
The Court of Justice should, in the days to come, declare the legality of President Musarraf's re-election of President Musarraf's 6th October, indirect vote, with a view to re-election.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been moved from his duties and has been replaced by another member.
"What we are witnesses of is illegal, constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," said the President to the newspaper The News.
President Pervez Musarraf's promise that he will leave the army's lives to fill the civilian president's role after he "he lost his status", announced on Monday the Deputy Minister of Information, Tariq Azeem, Deputy Minister of Information.
Musarraf had until 15 November, that was until the end of his first president's mandate, to fight from military uniform.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed the news of the postponement of the elections in January.
The Pakistani Government, however, called on the rumor spread across the country that President Musarraf was to appoint Deputy Director General Musarraf to take his place of forced residence.
Pregnancys more than one third are not planned to be planned for pregnancy more than one third.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unintended pregnancys.
Even today, more than one third of pregnancy (36%) is not planned - it appears from the study of the French National Demographic Institute (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act which liberalises contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unintended pregnancys.
Ined estimates that various methods of contraception, such as tablets or beespiral, still fail in 5-6% of cases.
However, according to the Institute, the liberalisation of contraception has made birth control more effective.The study notes that only 5% of women aged 20 to 44 have taken birth control pills in 1970, but now this rate is 60%.
Today, 10 pregnancys have been planned for eight years.
Each fifth couple of months is planning to be precise and, if possible, in spring, as this is the most enjoyable season for the child to be accepted by the child.
The spectacular repair at the space station is a spectacular repair at the space station.
Scott Parazynski's astronaut and crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work more than seven hours in space to carry out the spectacular improvement of the centralized solar panel essential for the scientific activity of the station.
This dangerous space has proved to be a record in several respects: the repair took a very long time to design it, and it had to be done with "barred" tools by spacers away from residential modules.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. It is a huge cylinder-shaped element that will soon be the location of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see the box).
This module is a passage to laboratory modules.
However, there is a need to take care of their power supply.
The second task of the crew was, therefore, to transfer one module that produced electrical power by means of the 17,5-tonne solar panels to the final location of the ISS.
After that, the crew started opening the module's 7-metre wide solar panels.
That's when one of the tables that were harmoniously connecting were offended by a narrow cable in a length of about 1 m.
In order to avoid further injury, the opening of the table has not been continued.
The mission of the astronauts was originally to take a watch walk from the Discovery Space Cycle and then repair another malfunctioned system solar module. Instead, their full time had to be devoted to improving the damaged solar module.
Scott Parazynskir was chosen to perform the exhibition hanging on his 30-metre robot arm attached to the station's crane.
He's one of NASA's best "space walkers."
High, strong, highly skilled, he's got muscle in his upper body and long arms.
So the 46-year-old medical-old man had to "operate" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully assessing the damage caused, he cut off the flawed cable and some "fly" recorded the damaged area.
He also helped in his work another "space walker" who stayed near the safe passage, and from there the other astronauts, including the crew captain Peggy Whitson, as well as the crew captain, Peggy Whitson.
He used a tool, a mini hockey stick, which was carried by the isolation of several hundreds of volts of solar panels, and the spaceships of the station had been shot and "baked" together.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited until his team opened the sign completely, and only then he packed up his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts held half a day rest, and then today they returned to the Discovery Space Chlor to begin their return scheduled for Wednesday.
The exchange rate for EADS shares is below the rate of the EADS shares.
The EADS share exchange rate fell greatly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company that manufactured aircraft and defence equipment announced that A400M aircraft development would result in an additional cost of €1.2-1.1.4 billion.
The EADS share rate is at present EUR 21.96 following a 4% decrease in the share capital of EADS.
The company was obliged to review its 2007 operating result forecasts as the A400M engine was delayed, which is why the aircraft was operated later.
The delay in the transfer of the military delivery aircraft, which was announced in October, will cost more than EUR 1,2 billion, of which more than 1 billion are affected by Airbust," reported the mother company of the European EADS manufacturing company.
Due to the occurrence of such expenditure, EADS will have to report new plans on its operating result in 2007 next Thursday, when reporting quarterly results, the company added but did not forward any further figures.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost estimates.
The EADS operating result decreased by 86% in 2006: it was largely due to the delay in developing another program, A380, which also imposes a large financial burden on the company.
The company originally planned to transfer A400M aircraft to the French army in October 2009.
You can keep the status of quo
No big surprise is the Sunday election: the great majority of the Russians will vote for the Prime Minister Putin, the One Russia.
In this respect, the Russians' stability, the need to speak of self-responsive governance is evident after a highly manipulated campaign.
Today, three days before parliamentary elections, the Russian Prime Minister of Vladimir Putin is speaking through public service channels in a television message to the voters that have already been recorded, but the content is still classified.
Putin is the leader of the Kremlt Support Party, the standlist of the Single Russia, which is expected to win a huge victory in the elections.
At the reception of foreign ambassadors yesterday, the Head of State did not say anything: he was only running a new run against the actions of Western countries, which was a popular subject in the campaign.
"We know what the price is for real democracy, so we want genuine, absolute transparent and open choices without any infringement" - he added.
However, the opposite is not the case at all.
The opposition condemns the campaign, in which they believe that the voters were under pressure.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gen Nagyij Zjuganov, says, "There was no such a dirty election in Russia even in the time of Jelcin."
After the fall of last weekend's protests, the former chess world champion Garri Kaszparov was sentenced to five days in prison for non-authorised protests, and his lawyer claims that he is still unable to visit.
"The Russians still think like "homo aadieticus."
The estimated election results raise two, even more obvious questions:
- Who's following Putin in the head of the state chair?
The official paper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, which will be 2 March 2008 and the candidates may indicate their intention of starting up until 23 December 2008.
Since Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 and 2004, his mandate may no longer be extended.
But there is no other successor on the horizon.
- What role does Putin play from March of Putin?
Prime Prime Minister?
Or will he decide on the government and the President as the leader of the Almighty One Russia Party or the majority of Parliament?
However, leaving power prevails both in Parliament and in presidential elections.
This has now become a haze.
The Russians are still thinking of a "homo aathetics": they do not feel that they can control their fate" - says Lev Gudkov, the director of the independent Lev Gudkov headquarters.
Nikolai Koposov, historian of the University of Szentpétervár, is even further away: it is theoretically that the country has become a Christian five hundred years later, so there is a delay in the development of civil society, and the traditional social spirit has delayed the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the '90s, 'I returned to the paternalist model, which was perfect for the people. At the same time, because this new kind of paternalism was not intimidating, but accompanied with certain economic welfare,' the opinion was Maria Lipman, a co-worker of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "responsiblely reject personal responsibility", which, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, quickly showed itself.
"Why should we think?"
The phenomenon affects all aspects of society, even the business world.
The administrative elite was interested in maintaining the current situation: the local lists of the Single Russia are led by 65 governors who are drawn from the leaders of the 85 Russian regions.
And freedom imported from the West is often a matter of chaos, as has happened in the 1990s.
The public prefers stability.
In this spirit, the Russians do not vote for extreme parties.
Tamara Cserednyenko 54-year-old teacher follows: "Why should we think about it?
The people in power are not so bad, why should we replace them?"
passing memories of a sudden memory.
After more than 60 years of encryption, the Bad Arolsen archive, which records the fate of 17 and half million victims of the hitler regime, has become public.
The 47 million archive document, which takes 27 kilometres of shelf in the Hessen province of Bad Arrolsen, has so far only been researchable for the purpose of "humanitarian", i.e. only an individual and a name-only look for the victims or descendants of the bows.
In May 2006, 11 states, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States of America, agreed to open the archive to researchers and historians.
After ratification of the Convention by all States, the archive was opened yesterday.
confidential information information information information information information information information information information information information confidential information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information information confidential information information information information information information information information information information
Opening the Bad Arolsen archive allows historians to conduct research into "the transfer of prisoners, the residents of camps and the state of health of forced workers" - explains Reto Meistern, director of the archive managed by the International Committee for the Red Cross.
Until now, several states, including Germany, have opposed the disclosure of documents as they also contain names and thus confidential information.
For example, some deported victims may have an assumed homosexuality or mental disability.
The purpose was to collect lists of concentration camps and arrest warrants issued by Gestapo for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to provide evidence of their internalisation, which could be used to compensate for the damage they had suffered from deported or forced labour.
There are currently over 300 permanent workers in Bad Arrolsen who are engaged in the processing of tens of thousands of specific needs.
However, a part of the information community does not consider the opening of Bad Arolsen's archive to be of major importance.
"These documents essentially do not contain any new news" - published in 2006 by Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of Research Centre for Anti-Semiticism at the University of Berlin.
The EU- India Free Trade Agreement would be signed in 2008 for the EU-In India Free Trade Agreement.
The intra-European bilateral trade turnover is now around EUR 60 billion on an annual basis.
EU India has its first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - announced Peter Mandelson's European Trade Commissioner and Kamal Nath Indian Minister for Trade.
The EU's foreign ministers have already approved in April that the European Commission should start negotiations on the signing of free trade agreements with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). The annual turnover of bilateral trade in India is now close to EUR 60 billion.
EU India has its first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
In addition, the EU is India's main foreign investor, but India is only the 9th most important trading partner of the EU, according to the figures of the European Commission.
Peter Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement can have economic effects for both parties" and "India could thus increase its presence on a 450 million-residents florist market".
The two giants, Europe and Asia replace each year "EUR 47 billion" and "EUR 10 billion" services - said Danièle Smadja this week, the head of the European Commission delegation in New Zealand. However, he regrets that bilateral trade " has not always reached its full potential". The EU and India will meet in New Zealand during the eighth diplomatic summit, which will be attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and José Manuel Durao Barroso, President of the European Commission.

Answering the concerns: the Bank of England offers 10 billion dollars for the money market for a five-week maturity period of five weeks for the financial market.
The Bank of England would like to alleviate the concerns about credit ratings, so on Thursday it announced that it would put 10 billion English pounds in the money market, which it would make available on this occasion with five weeks' duration, in contrast to the basic provision of 5,75% and normally.
"We want to reduce the concerns that money market conditions will be particularly bad at the end of the year, and we would also like banks to plan their liquidity position more safely for this period. Therefore, from 6 December, some of the Bank's reserves will be offered in the framework of a five-week open market operation on the international financial market" - stands in its press release.
According to the bank, 10 billion (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 a.m. local time. The bid will be valid at 12:15 a.m. and the repayment deadline will be 10 a.m. on 10 January.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue liquidity funds for five weeks under an open market operation.
The duration of such operations is usually one week.
In a press release of the Bank of England, he added that "to take further measures" in order to ensure that the inter-bank loans correspond to the key portfolio of the central bank.
The current interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The interest rate for three months exceeded the level of 18 September: currently stands at 6.6%.
Since the start of the summer financial market crisis, the Bank of England has calculated a significant criminal interest in the money market, which has called back the banks from taking advantage of it.
In a rumor (which only reinforces the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound compared to the euro) the resources offered by the European Central Bank would have been much more pleased with the resources they could have received at better interest rates and greater discretion.
The UMP and NC refuse to examine the socialist proposal for purchasing power as a socialist proposal.
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group closed themselves on Thursday to discuss the articles of the socialist bill relating to purchasing power, which is equivalent to the rejection of the text itself.
The text of the meeting initiated by the Socialists contained about ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party. These included, for example, a 50% increase in the employment allowance, the re-establishment of the variable fuel tax, the introduction of the travel check and the restriction of rental fees.
As the UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the examination of the articles, the discussion of the Government Party and the opposition was finally interrupted in mid-term, only a few hours before the television speech by President Nicolas Sarkozy about his purchasing power.
The Head of the Socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayraul, has announced that its group will resubmit all its proposals in the context of the amendment of the corrective financial act to be put on the agenda of the Assembly next week.
A new festival is being created.
There was a number of speeches about the new Philodelphian Music Festival to be held by the C3 Press. However, the event was announced by Melvin Benn's British producer company, in cooperation with the Festival Republic, in New Jersey, the Vienna Music Festival.
"It is an honor for us to work with someone who's starting today's American festival," said Billboard.com to Charlie Jones from C3.
C3 also organizes the Lolapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limited Music Festival.
The Vineland Festival in New Jersey is held in the summer, so there will be a way to encourage.
The festival will be held between 8 and 10 August in a 500-long private area of approximately 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most respected festivals.
In 1989, he started the British Reading Festival, which attracts some 80 000 visitors every year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn further expanded its membership of the Leeds Festival, and in 2006 the public Republic invited Latitude Festival to life in Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been a co-owner of the Glastonbury Festival producer, licensing and organisation tasks. This festival is now able to accommodate up to 177 500 people.
C3's associate, Charlie Jones, called the Glastonbury Festival "the most inspiring event", which he has ever participated in. He added that his company and Melvin Benn's companies work in parallel with the fact that the region is rich in a European-style festival.
"We've chosen the Philadelphia venue before, and together with the Fairmount Parks Committee, we worked hard on it to organize this festival in the centre of Philadelphia," said Charlie Jones.
"We continued to work with the city, and the Commission has shown great enthusiasm for our plan.
Unfortunately, the organisation failed because of the political manpowers of the city," said Charlie Jones.
"We were able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing for a huge festival in another unique venue, which ultimately serves the interests of the inhabitants of Philadelphia."
The C3 Preses re-enacted the Lolapalooza Festival in Grant Park in Chicago in 2005, after having proved its exceptional festival talent in 2002 with the Austin City Limited Music Festival.
The GDP of the two events in 2007 was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
Both festivals were held at the urban location.
"The European concept of Melvin Ben is based on the rural festival, while our festivals usually take place in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two models in some way and to create a European rural mood and a traditional urban sense of living in America."
Vineland is approximately half-way between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The people of Vienna, and even the mayor himself, are keen to support the event," says Charlie Jones.
Although he does not talk about the details of the agreement, he says that "the conditions are favourable enough to allow an investment in such an event to be made at a location that hopefully will be home to the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival will be sized with approximately 80 000 people in the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennesse.
The concerts have already received an invitation to the event, but at the time of the press release, nothing is final.
"Vineland is going to be an essentially rock festival, but we're planning a variety of musical offers to make everyone find their way into it," says Charlie Jones.
Jones and his two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles Att, together with the C3 company, which last Billboard Touring Awardson received the "best independent event planner" recognition.
Montreal is facing the Terminator.
It's not easy to lure hollywood directors to Montreal if you need to fight the Terminator with you...
"Advance" is one of the tasks assigned to the montreali.
The mission promises to be "politically difficult" because the California Governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is opposed to filming his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to fight "Terminator Governor"?
"We have to be careful, because the film industry itself decides which one of the best locations is for him.
If you find that the conditions are favourable in Montreal, that's where you're going.
Our job is to offer you the best possible conditions, based on which they decide for us," says Schwarzenegger.
A match for festivals.
However, Denise Turcotte is now focusing mainly on the promotion of Canadian films.
The race for the Oscars started.
The aim is to present and promote as many Québeci films as possible at every American film festival, whether it is Sundance Film Festival, whether it is the denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. It is also necessary to make efforts to ensure that directors keep hearings.
The film L'Âge des ténèbres received a favourable reception a few weeks ago at the 30. Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, it will also be launched at the Palm Springs International Festival.
The film Shakespeare Hands with the Devil is also presented in Santa Monica and in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
In addition, Quebec represented himself with four short films and four game films this month at the American Film Institute Festival event.
Will there be a rally on the stock exchange be the end of the year? Expert's opinion is shared by experts on the "subprim" crisis.
Barely five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubping their hands and looking forward to the end of the usual year.
However, it is not clear to the experts this year whether this will actually happen.
Banif says "statistically in December, the stock exchange generally behaves positively.
However, forecasts of a purely statistical background are not necessarily correct, and indeed, in the current situation there is uncertainty about the market, at least in the short term."
Experts do not agree with the end of the stock exchange year, although they declare that "the stock market is maintained by the presence of liquidity, this will enable investment, as alternatives to the guarantee are lacking, in particular fixed yield, which is negatively affected by the escape of quality securities, long as short term".
Therefore, they believe that the exchange rate will be driven by a lateral movement free of volatility, "mainly since the effects of the Fed-kamatláb reduction are not yet known, the price of crude oil is high and the inflation voltage is also threatened".
Javier Barrio, the BPI's sales manager in Spain, agrees with that, which means that he believes it would be risky to state that there would be a rally.
According to the expert, "it's not a whole lot of roses".
The loss of Ibex is nearly 4 per cent compared to the highest values recorded on 8 November when the index was closed at 15.945,7 points.
Nevertheless, not all experts are so jealous.
According to Juan Solana, InterMoney's analyst, Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16.000 because of the reorganization of the wallets and payments to the standard pension fund at that time.
However, the expert adds that a few changes are expected this year, as the rally is due to take place for the second week of December, after a long weekend on the Constitutional Zone.
The analyst considers it unlikely that volatility would affect market trends.
Federico Olucha, analyzed by Inverses Banco, we are close to the technical level and "we can see a decline in the stock exchange index, which may also rise depending on the news from the USÁ, on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that these will be favourable.
Analysts agree with what will be the securities intended to achieve the new maximum Ibex quotas.
Soloa, from InterMoney, she stresses that "this year there's been a series of big securities".
The expert would add two large banks and a few construction companies to the list "until the electricity sector will be very expensive by then."
Federico Olucha from Inversis Banco states that the rise is due to the banking sector and industry.
The rally can also be positive for construction companies, of course, if it does at all.
"ACS has been trying to recover its positions for several months and we hope that Ferroval and FCC construction companies will follow this path", says the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be the main factor in the remaining half of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas period.
On the other hand, according to the expert, technology companies may also be able to do well, although the representation in the Spanish market is not too high in this area.
Five times in seven years five times in seven years
For the past seven years, only two exchange rates have occurred in December.
We observed the real year's rally in 2003 when stock markets fell out of the crisis caused by the outbreak of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex 35 corrected 28.17 per cent, a jump of 6.68 per cent was registered in December.
So it is still open that 2007 will be the fifth profitable year of the fifth consecutive year (i.e. ibex shows an increase of 8,36% since January) and whether the final race could occur.
The Banco Popular Español will open a 12-hour open-open opening account open for 12 hours from Monday to Monday from 200 Monday to Monday to Monday to Monday from 200 to Monday to Monday.
Banco Popular Español decided to renovate most of its branches.
This concerns a total of 200 branches of the most commercially affected parts of Spain.
These branches run under the name Popular Max and bring a major change to the bank.
However, for the other Spanish institutions, as this is the first group whose accounts are kept continuously until 20:30 this evening, even from 10 a.m. on Saturdays until 20:30 a.m.
The other group, BBVA, which has also repeatedly stated that it is planning its longer stay in its branches, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
However, it has recently been a deal with trade unions that closes 75% of its accounts to open up in exchange for one afternoon, although not for the public.
Banco Popular Español's experience will be crucial for other institutions, since it will decide on this basis whether they will join the initiative to support better business modernisation.
This is exactly the objective of Banco Popular Español's project.
In those places, I would like to target private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individual entrepreneurs and local businesses.
The bank would like to operate 200 accounts throughout Spain for 18 months with the above-mentioned accommodation, because it is not a new registration system but an existing conversion.
To this end, the institution modernises its branches in trading zones as required by customers of each street.
Thus, the extension of the stay is accompanied by a new kind of reflection of the nature of the drawers, a more modern, colourful design.
The responsibility of the commercial banks, Ángel Rivera, points out that restructuring does not require major investment, but they have to employ more staff, which represents eight or nine employees per branch instead of the current six.
The branches, even for SMEs, will not sell financial products.
Favorite experience with good experience.
The Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in its three Madrid branch.
According to Ángel Rivero, experiences were positive.
In the streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía, the election took place, and Rivero said that the decision was correct.
Banco Popular Español currently has 2.500 drawers.
Another 60 works under the name Mundocredit, specializes in immigrants, and also has a very favourable opening order, even on Sundays and holidays.
In those units of PopularMax, it is not the BBVA model where some branches offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"We don't want to create competition for our clients," says Rivero.
Recently, they managed to reach agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones using external personnel.
Telecinco first doubles its rival, Antena 3's stock exchange value at a stock exchange value of exchange values.
"We did it."
By this sentence, he expressed his satisfaction yesterday at closing the market, as Paolo Vasile, the trustee of Telecinco, when it turned out that he was the double rival of the television operator, Antena 3's value.
One thing about it was her joy: "It only hurts that it's not because we've increased more, but because we've fallen less," she said.
He has already placed great emphasis on "we've fallen less" in the weak market.
Telecinco closed yesterday with 2.54 percent reinforcements.
This increase is set at 15.66 per cent of the annual loss.
52 per cent of the company belongs to Mediaset, 13 per cent of Vocento's, so its stock exchange value is EUR 4.488.88 million according to Bloomberg's data.
Rivalala, Antena lost 1.52 per cent yesterday and has been able to account for 40,5 per cent loss since January, so yesterday it was half, 2.193,46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies is 3.51 million for Sogecable; for Prisa (issued by Cinco Días), 2.58.5.83 million for Sogecable and 1.779 million for Vocento.
Vasile considers that comparisons with Antena 3 are comparable between the two companies.
The question is, how much can we meet on the same market, what costs and how all this can be achieved in terms of ratings?
Telecinco announced last week that he wanted to be the first TV channel over 1 billion advertising revenues this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, Telecinco and Publiespaña, a member of the group's advertising company.
If the notified fact is made, the television channel would raise its advertising revenues by 3.6 per cent in this financial year compared to 965.4 million, registered in the 2006 financial year.
The net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the year (so reached 734.4 million), while the net turnover of television increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
According to the analysts, one of Telecinco's rise factors has so far been high pay out: in 2006 the company President Echevarría divided 100% of its share capital between its shareholders.
Vasile believes that, although it would be too early to decide, this proportion may change after taking Endemol 33% of its mother's company, in association with Mediaset.
"We are very much guaranteed to pay the minimum of 50%, although we have always shared much more.
I hope this year our shareholders will be pleased with us because we have already enjoyed 33 percent of Endemol's acquisition."
According to the analysts, the market is currently characterised by some decline.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its yield estimates for Telecinco by 4 per cent in 2008 and 2009 by 7 per cent in 2008 and 2009.
They say that this is due to the estimated increase in turnover from 10,5 per cent in 2008 to 8,4 per cent in 2008 and to 5,5 per cent in 2009 to 5.1 per cent.
According to the same company, Antena 3's profit in 2008 is reduced by 4.5 per cent and in 2009 by 7.5 per cent.

Ibersecurities: proposes the purchase of both securities, mainly due to the high volume of dividends and the long-term long-term long-term sustainability potential.
II.
Caja Madrid: sees Telecinco as more favourable (sale) than Antena 3 because of its "multiple attraction" and business strengthening.

JPMorgan: in both cases, it proposes underweighting because of the "risks" (marketed and less favourable economic climate).
The Congress approved the acceptance of MiFID took effect on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary procedure, which has ended today with a Congress vote approving the changes to the Senate, the government has launched a social dialogue on the regulation that is the basis of the law, so that both of them can take their life before the end of the year.
Representatives of different groups have consistently highlighted their efforts to negotiate and conclude negotiations and agreements which have served to establish the most favourable normative standard for investor protection and to regulate the activities of companies in a detailed way in order to ensure efficient market functioning.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Act, allows for the modernisation of financial markets, but at the same time strengthens investor protection, broadens the supervisory rights of the Spanish National Securities Market Committee (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new director will allow financial advisory services to be made available to specialised companies, but also to natural or legal persons, as well as to trading companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies, to create a new financial service company (ESIS), namely financial advisory companies (AFI).
Moreover, the law increases the number of systems capable of implementing operations relating to funds, thus adding to regulated secondary markets the multilateral trading platforms and the internalisation systems which are being put into competition with the current stock exchange participants.
In addition, the Act obliges investment service providers to provide information on their specific aspects, risk taking and risk management methods, as well as to facilitate the verification of CNMV, to keep records of all operations carried out.
A number of amendments have been tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which are of key importance for treating securities debt as a "complex" currency because of its high risk to the investor. This has been confirmed by the US high risk mortgage credit (subprime).
On the other hand, the directive transposition was also used to legally outline the scope of activities of those with economic and entrepreneurship skills, 30 years after the adoption of the Royal Regulation setting out the professional functions of sole economic operators in 1977.
And the Senate proposed to create new players in the financial sector, such as the intermediary agent working on another account, does not need a CNMV licence, and at the same time, it can sell products to several investors or acquire customers.
Consumer Price Index increased by 0.5 points in November and thus reached 4.1%.
This indicator, taken into account by Eurostat to calculate the inflation rate of the European Union, shows the evolution of prices in Spain for the month of November.
It complies with Eurostat and the European Central Bank’s strategy to provide information that can be compared with data from the United States and with the time and nature of their origin.
The calculation method used for the preliminary indicator is the same as for calculating the Harmonised Price Index, but the statistical modelling method differs in order to estimate information that is not yet available at the moment of publication.
The Statistical Office pointed out that the preliminary indicator is purely indicative and could therefore be different from the final data which will be made public on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price Index continues to show a relatively high value."
Pedro Solbes, Vice-President of the Government and the Minister for Economic Affairs, stated that the rise in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1 % in November would only be "long-term", but at the same time predicted that the price index would be expected to show a relatively high value in the months to come.
In Parliament's corridors, Solbes confirmed that "although the indicator is not very favourable", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less at the same level in recent years within the monetary union.
He also added that the month of November has brought a "less surprise" than the previous month when the Government did not account for such a great increase.
"We expected a value of around 4 %" was recognised by the Minister of the Economic Affairs regarding the information published today.
With Northern Rock, he wants to reach EUR 42 billion over the three years of Virginia.
Northern Rock deposits have been back by more than 50%, and they are currently making only 12 billion (EUR 16 billion 800 million) since the crisis occurred in mid-September and needed urgent loans from the National Bank of England.
It still had a record of over $25 billion, whose number gradually decreased over the past two and a half months due to the loss of confidence of customers, despite the fact that the Government promised a 100% guarantee to the bank at the end of the crisis.
In the course of its own financial, commercial name, Virgin Money will operate this unit. Virgin will have to earn around a quarter of the income of British banks in the next three years to obtain the remaining $1 18 billion and thus reach the 30 billion target.
The purpose of Richard Branson's group, which has become known to a large-scale advertising campaign in England, is to spend around 50 million pounds (i.e. 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve the goal pursued.
Northern Rock this week has raised a bid from the Virgin consortium as the most advantageous to avoid bankruptcy. Three other companies, along with Virgin, are the consortium.
Mayor Totana was arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The Pacific Police arrested the Mayor of Totana (the People's Party) in the morning in the Province of Murcia, as it is suspected that he was affected by the urban corruption scandal this week.
He was arrested outside of his office as one of the mayors of Városháza and the police chief of the town.
The former member of the city council, José Martínez Andreo, took over the place of Juan Morales from May to May, who, according to the official bodies asked by the SER radio channel, could have been the head of the corruption network.
The police are still investigating the city's offices, as well as the City Development Council, and it cannot be excluded that further arrests are expected.
Juan Morales' lawyer was also under investigation, as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that took place this week.
According to the information from the SER radio, Juan Morales' attorney in the People's Party was arrested when Morales left the corruption dossier in his bag.
According to police sources, the subject of the investigation is the supposed commission that Morales received in exchange for signing a urban development agreement with a Galicia Construction Company with 200 hectares of land reclassification.
Currently eight persons are under arrest.
Bono accepts the appointment of PSOE in Toledo and the President of Parliament if they win the elections.
Former Minister of Defence, José Bono accepted the offer of the Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mr José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to run the list of PSOE interpreters in the next parliamentary elections, and to fill the President-General of Parliament if the Socialists win the elections.
This was announced by PSOE's Secretary General, José Blanci at a press conference, and Bono himself has confirmed the party at the center of the Federal Party since the meeting with Zapatero this morning.
The Prime Minister was justified by the election of the former Minister to "calculate the best" in politics, and Bono was "the best" in politics.
He also stated that "mortally" the Manchai politician would be a socialist candidate to the President of Parliament if the Socialists were to win in the forthcoming elections.
Bono would take over the position of President Manuel Marín, who announced on 15 November that he was not willing to take up the next elections and give up his political career in scientific circles, and then fight against climate change in scientific circles.
The former Minister has admitted that the Prime Minister has been constantly sorry about his return to the policy scene since he left active politics two years ago.
He also added that, since the voters are aware of who will be the Vice-President of the Socialists in the event of the victory, the Party would like to inform them of who will be President of Parliament.
If Bono is really going to fill in the post, Parliament would like to have 'the respect and not the colour of insult or screaming' and would be more like the home of its citizens.
"At times, it seems that Parliament is the only place in Madrid where there is no peace to speak, that its Prime Minister's speech was broken 26 times in the Senate".
At the same time, he welcomed the current president, Manuel Marín, for his excellent work, but he didn't want to make himself the president anymore, so that his opponents don't think he's "sufficient".
A campaign for climate change.
Since the climate change movement has shown mercy in pursuing both sceptical behavior towards their forecasts and those who prefer political or social battles must be very strong.
In fact, you must also place a political leader like Governor Zapatero, who says that the movement is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism, and declare that "we have to make a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of the extent to which Spain has contributed to the failure of the Kyoto Convention to fulfil its activities or inactivity within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected and why the Government has not sought to avoid this?
In addition, it should clearly explain to the Spanish what measures it intends to take to prevent climate change.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, the customs of the population to change, the energy saving of individual and social levels and the economic consequences of this will be economic consequences?
So who has to sacrifice and who has to pay to save our Earth?
But we didn't get it, and we won't even get an explanation for these questions.
That's precisely because it's about sacrifice and money.
Climate change has taken measures, the actual measures are always unpopular.
They are expensive, uncomfortable and cost-effective for both companies and the population.
Even the increase in PSOE's gas supply would have meant so unpopular before the elections that Zapatero quickly withdrawn it.
That Earth must be saved with empty, simply propaganda texts, empty passwords free of real consequences.
Agreements, committees, protocols and new posts.
The agreement with the Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who speaks so nicely in the election campaign, does not demand, does not attack, even build election meetings and tenderness in us.

Mayor Totana was arrested and the police chief was arrested for a suspected corruption case of suspected corruption.
The Police have arrested the mayor of Totana, the mayor of the People's Party José Martínez Andreot, the local Police Commissioner, the Secretary of the City Hall and a catering company for crimes related to urban development, and police sources have been informed today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and then transferred to the City Hall, he is currently staying with several police officers, many of whom are under investigation by the City Development Council and the municipal services entrusted with the management of Iparlads and Lakes.
The three arrests prevented the arrest of six persons in Galicia, Madrid and Murcia on Monday last week in a case in which 2 hectares of agricultural land could be built up to allow the establishment of 4000 apartments for the Galicia Nuaria company after payment of an unlawfully paid to managers at the time of their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not been arrested yet, but are under investigation according to the information provided by the Totanian Court No 1.
The first six persons arrested were handed to the court.
According to official sources, former Mayor of Totana Juan Morales, who today is also under investigation an independent parliamentary representative of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a real estate agency registered in Totana, is also examined as well as the current girlfriend of the former mayor, who lives in the centre of Murcia province.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, Manuel N.The lawyer and contractor have been arrested in Nigrára (Pontevedra), along with Suelo de Inmonuar’s director, Pablo José M.G., who is also part of the Nuaria Group and has been subject to bribes through it.
The investigation shall be carried out by a group of crimes committed at the level of the State Department of the Opponents Centre, whose members held 11 searches outside of the arrests, in particular in the companies associated with the arrests, which operate in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Totana was arrested by a single person: the owner of a company with well-known poultry products in the area, who could have played an intermediary role in the matter.
The Nuaria Group would have set up the largest residential park in Totana, where 5000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels were built.
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which has been reclassified. The project would have doubled the population of the currently 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is composed of companies such as: Autesa e Iomonuar, Vigo, Conycase, which is responsible for managing the parking spaces of Coruna, Venezuela and Catholic Ferdinand Square, and Preconiza, specialising in direct marketing and selling, promotion and installation of building elements.

If you agree, we'll put aside the Book of the Month a little bit and see if we can acquire some philosophical knowledge and wisdom.

Our Finnish reporter found this comment in one of Finland’s largest newspapers: (in particular, on the world’s cultural level, at the end of the PISA report), Helsinki Sanomat, referring to the criticism of Blackburn’s book on 18 November at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn’s book.
"The philosophic teachings were presented to the public after the tragedy of the Jokela High School.
The killer quoted the writings of Plato and Nietzsche in the messages of a student standing before a degree.
The Education Council, Pekka Elo, responsible for teaching philosophy on the website of the City of Helsinki Sanomat, called for teachers to look at Plato's teachings with critical eyes and added that Nietzsche's knowledge is not necessarily important for schools' mandatory basic philosophy classes".

One of his colleagues informs us that the Code of Criminal Procedure contains a complaint about online downloads:
A. The download of a song number is considered a sin and is punishable from six months to a year.
However, if you steal files of less than EUR 400 in a store, it is only an infringement (Article 63.1).
B. If you steal EUR 1000 in a store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty still does not reach the level of penalties to be imposed on online download (Article 234 TKT).
C. If you steal a car, but take it back in 40 hours, the sentence will still not reach a fine to be imposed on internet download (Article 244.1).
D. You can expect less punishment if you get into a fight than if you copy a CD.
If you participate in a mass struggle, you can get a sentence of three months to one year (Article 154 BKT), but a sentence of two years for copying the CD for a CD drive from six months to two years.
(Article 270 TKT).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the BTK, sexual harassment at work is not as serious as a video download of a DVD.
F. The marketing of copyright-protected films without the consent of authors is more punishable than the sale of pornography material to minors (Article 186).

My practitioner gave me an article on strange research with the following address: "The money is causing brain activity, especially if the others have less."
Which means workers' feelings on the day of payment depend on how much they received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonni, measured by a tumography of magnetic resonants, and the results were also published in the last number of science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and head of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany, Bernd Weber, the leader of the Neurokognomtion Group in Germany, said: "The strongest activity was measured when the participant replied correctly, but the partner made a mistake".
Researchers found that if they both got the right answer and received the same amount of money, brain activity was moderate, but if one of them had doubled, the activity also increased.
I have no idea why such great science needed such a simple conflict.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte, for eight years now, has shown mercy to the Balkan war criminals from the Office of the Prosecutor's Office of the Court of Justice of the former Yugoslavia for crimes committed.
His mandate will end at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a slightly bitter mouth, as the responsible for bleeding in srebrenica, during which 8000 Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been slaughtered, i.e. General Ratko Mladic and Prime Minister Radova Karajic of Serbia are still on the loose.
Their names are listed on the list selected by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach as the title of his documentary: Carla's list (2006, Spain has not yet been introduced). Like the real crime of the film, the Swiss Attorney General will follow his work from Belgrade to New York as soon as he tries to put pressure on the governments involved to put the loop around the fugitive sinners.
What kind of insurance does I have?
Car insurance, which provides safety for the owner of a car, depends on significant costs and depends on several factors such as age, sex, date of obtaining a licence, family status, type and type of use of the car to be insured.
The acquisition of the car is only a step first.
In fact, choosing adequate insurance is often more difficult than deciding what kind of car we want.
First of all, we need to be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This Agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the insurance undertaking accepts compensation at the head of the fixed insurance premium in the event of damage.
The insurance premium is basically the amount paid for the insurance, which is determined by taking into account different factors, such as age, sex, date of obtaining a licence, family status, type of car to be insured, use of it and other factors.
Insurance companies set the insurance premium on the basis of statistics, i.e. they pay a higher sum for those who represent a higher risk of accident.
This is why they pay less than 25 years of age, or women pay less because statistics show that they represent a lower risk because they are more cautious.
Similarly, according to the findings, insurance companies have concluded that married people also cause fewer accidents than lonely people.
The frequency in which the car is used is decisive for the type of car.
The possibility of an accident is increased for more frequent use.
In determining the insurance premium, many factors are taken into account by insurance companies.
Therefore, the owner needs to look carefully into how he can choose the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are key factors for the choice to adapt and establish an acceptable price to the needs of the recipient.
At the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, under 25-year-olds must account for a number of backs such as lack of driving experience and freshness of the licence.
Although the most ideal thing to do is to ensure that we are against all risks, there are also more economic solutions.
The most careful leaders can commit complete insurance, and this will be secured against all risks, and the price will be affordable.
In a contract of this type, the insured will pay part of the damage.
"The extent of the contributions paid by the insured depends on the insurance fee; the higher the fee, the lower the part," says Luis Noguera, the director of the online insurance intermediary First Europa in Spain.
Another option is to extend liability insurance to third parties when the client provides himself against the damage caused to others, but not to the damage caused by his own car.
In addition, there will be insurance against theft, firestorm and car loss.
It's a good advice.
If you are 25 years old, be careful and avoid accidents if possible, because this will have an effect on the bonus and thus reduce the amounts payable in the future.
Bonuses are called discounts in relation to the basic rate of the insurance company.
The penalty for the basic tariff, and we call it a masculine.
"The degree of bonus and profit depends on the insurance company and its profits.
If it was a good year for the company, you can allow yourself to increase the bonus rate" explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year-old age has been exceeded, it is easier for owners to provide adequate insurance, as the risk of accidents is reduced due to experience gained over the years.
At that time, we advise you to take full insurance with you.
"Although young people are not yet able to apply their experiences properly during an accident or even when driving," says the director of the European insurance company in Spain, adding that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of driving, when leaders have already gone beyond the fear of beginners.
If the insured person is already married, but he still has no children, it is best to have complete insurance, of course, if his financial opportunities allow this to happen.
Insurance companies consider pedigree couples to be the least risk clients, so in their case the fee to be paid is also lower.
In this case, the best complete insurance is self-employed (this can reach EUR 300), or if you have a higher bonus, you can extend insurance to damage to others from the third year of the vehicle.
"They're leading more calmly, but at the same time they have greater purchasing power and can allow themselves to be higher by themselves," Luis Noguera confirmed.
In the case of pensioners, the complete insurance is offered by means of a margin (approx. around EUR 150) or by extension to liability insurance in the case of higher bonuses.
Car insurance is very important, not only because it constitutes protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it represents a large amount of money, so it is essential that we choose properly the personalised form of insurance.
Celtic wants to score points in Milan to get into the eighth final.
Milan and Celtic will measure their strength in San Siro stadium on Tuesday to obtain the missing point when the Champions League closes.
The Italians have a total of ten points, and already in the fifth round, they have provided for further access with a tie with Portugal, but the Celtic has nine points, but one more thing they need to do is to ensure that the six-point Shakhtar, who will fight the four-point Benfica, will not prevent it.
The two D games will be held one week before the end of the sixth round, as Milan will have to play in Japan at the Club World Championship, where on 13 he will try to fight for the further access to the 16th final.
With this group D will be completed sooner than the rest, although the most likely result in the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be a tie, the two teams will aim to win, because the Italians do not want to stay home, and the Celtic will be the first place to start from the eighth floor.
The defeat of Gordon Strachan's team is enough to qualify you if Shakhtar doesn't win, but it can't be certain, because if there's a level playing field, Ukrainians will go on, who lost in Glasgow last week (2-1), but won the next strike (2-0).
The Italians will try to make it difficult for the evening of the Scottishs, who would like to get into the eighth quarter of the League of Regent Champions twice a second, after having received an extension from the Koka (1-0) during the previous season (1-0).
The victory of "Rossonerik" would be most pleased, because if you lost the Celtic, you'd be in the eighth finals and you'd be left in the UEFA.
Since Benfica, even though he is at last and is unlikely to be caught in the European Championship, you can still get the third place with a victory to play in the UEFA.
2,000 people went to Vancouver to attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour.
Spice Girls in Vancouver (Canada) started his tour, and they've been performing for the first time since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) were announced a few minutes before the concert organised at vancover GM Place that the band was "indelived".
Some 20,000 people have exchanged tickets to be there at the concert, where they have also presented a video of the story of a concert that had brought great success in the 1990s.
At the same time, the EMI, which was launched on the market in Spain at the same time as the band and the tour, is a new album, where the larger scales and two new songs are included "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five members of Spice Girls' husband Posh Spice, British footballist David Beckham, took a bracelet on stage.
The athlete was also there on the views of the GM Place, although a few days before Victoria banned it.
When the performance was presumptuous, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "he hasn't seen our performance clothes yet, so I'm nervous about what he'll think about the performance."
'Sporty Spice', was the reason why the band split up two years after he left the band in 1998 'cause the members didn't understand each other. He also seemed nervous at the press conference that was held two hours before the concert.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feelings of people that you felt about Spice Girls have changed.
Now I'm glad I decided so," Chisholm said about the band that he broke up nine years earlier because of it.
The singer also added that, at times, "the things have settled down and we love each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the last time the Spice Girls played in 1998.
CTV reports that the team arrived on a separate computer from Virgin Airlines to Vancouver.
At the airport, a bunch of baby-sitters were waiting for them.
Five have seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the team will perform in California (USA), then in San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7 in December).
Their action will take place on 23 December Madrid.
Another fears about the Russian- Ukrainian gas dispute about the Russian- Ukrainian gas dispute.
The gas price has been renewed between Ukraine and Russia, which may also affect Russian fuel to be transported to Western Europe.
Most of the Russian gas exported to the European Union (EU) is being transferred through Ukraine and the disputes between the two nations are always being very closely monitored.
Kiev stated that if Moscow raised the gas price paid by the Ukrainians, they would also hurt Russia at higher transit costs.
As a result of a previous debate between the two countries last year, supplies to EU countries decreased.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow was opened with regard to the attempt by the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned natural gas monopoly, the attempt by Gazprom to reach an agreement on the level of gas price to be paid to Russia in 2008 by Ukraine to Russia.
The Gazprom stated that for gas produced from neighbouring Turkmenistan, a 50% increase should be made compared to the 2008 price agreement with Ukraine.
According to the analysts, this could mean a 40% increase in the price of the consignment from Gazprom to Ukraine.
"It is important that during the negotiations, one of the main countries of transit of natural gas is to be considered in accordance with the state of transit", said Ms Anatoly Kinah, Ukrainian Minister of Economic Affairs, to the Reuters news agency.
"A change in gas prices should certainly be linked to the debate on the level of the costs of transit through Ukraine (and transit to Western Europe).
As a result of the latest significant gas price between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom closed the gas strike to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has resulted in a dominant decrease in exports to Western Europe, which has also led to a large drop in prices.
Russia's gas supply to the European Union is about one quarter of the Russian gas.
Russia has the world's largest natural gas reserves, but most of them are still undiscovered.
As a result, Gazprom's own gas supply is accompanied by natural gas from the countries of Crimea and other Central Asia.
NHS is "obliged to monitor foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS Committees must improve the monitoring of criminal records for workers from outside Europe - a supervisory body has declared it to be a supervisory body.
The proposal was made by Robert Black after a foreign national doctor in Scotland was contacted by a June attack on the airport in Glasgow.
Black also expressed his concern about the fact that NHS Scotland does not have accurate data on the number of workers working overseas.
However, in its report - through a sample of five health authorities - he also pointed out key controls that were carried out properly.
Following an attack at the airport in Glasgow, the main auditor checked the list of staff recruited outside the European Economic Area.
28-year-old Bilal Abdullah, a doctor from Royal Alexandra Hospital Iraq, Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep rushed to the headquarters of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three doctors who were interviewed by the Old Bailey court in October by the charges of car bombing attempts in the UK.
The NHS Committees’ staff from overseas countries should check the existence of the qualifications and working experience of the workers concerned and the provision of authorisations for work in the United Kingdom before starting employment.
While the Scottish Health Committees are applying Discovery Scotland to ensure the verification of criminal records, the Agency is not entitled to obtain such information from outside the United Kingdom.
Among other things, the report of the principal has suggested that committees introduce guidance for the Office for Criminal Record, which facilitates control processes with different overseas countries for the employer.
"Although we found evidence of such checks among the staff records, they are not carried out regularly", the report states.
According to Black, the Scottish NHS performs its own pre-employment examination process at the same level, he added: "Our report highlights the areas to be developed to ensure that we have up-to-date information on the number of staff from the NHS overseas staff."
Dr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland, says that it is "unusable" to identify potential NHS employees who may commit terrorist acts in the future by means of pre-employment checks.
"The report states that pre-employment checks are working well in NHS Scotland and that the value of the proposals is not yet transparent".
According to Scottish health authorities, the majority of their overseas staff have reached 1161 employees.
However, the principal pointed out that numbers are likely to be higher, which can be partly explained by the problem for committees of identification of unemployed workers who are off-limited.
During the investigation, it has also been shown that the control procedures introduced in the Ayrshire and Arran region, the Grammian, the Great Glasgow and Clyde, the Lanarkshire, as well as in the NHS authorities in Lothian are largely coordinated.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, certificates of employment and documents certifying qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently examining the directive and guidance on controls and guidelines for the prevention of checks on workers from countries outside the sea.
Nicola Sturgeon's Secretary of Health said: "I am delighted that this task was carried out following the attack on Glasgow Airport.
It also added that the Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committees, will take into account the proposals contained in the report and will ensure that the updated guidance on pre-employment checks for all staff, including those from overseas, reflects the best practical application. The updated version will be published in the following month.

The late singer of Joy Division, a bipic from Ian Curtis, "Control", has received five prizes from the British Independent Film Award, including the award for the best movie.
He was awarded the lead character, Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before Curtis's creation, as well as director Anton Corbijn, and also director Toby Kebbell's ancillary character.
The award for the best actress was won by Dame Judi Dench with a troller called "The details of a scandal".
And the Variety Prize - for the preparation of the British film in international reflector lights - was taken by Daniel Craig, the Bond-makers, who made the Bond.
The awards were awarded during the ceremony in Roundhouse in London.
The film "Control", Curtis, presents the rise in Joy Division's Berlin until 1980, when he was 23 years old, committed suicide.
The production of "The Killers", David Bowie and "New Order on the soundtrack" cost only 3 million pounds.
However, the Dutch photographer Corbijn, who formerly became known for the production of the album cover of U2 "Joshua Tree", has been rich with two prizes; the best director and the best starter prize.
Another award award for the celebration was placed at the center of the rock music; Julien Temple of Joe Strummer, the film of Clash's singer, took the award for the best documentary film.
The best actor became Viggo Mortensen's award for making David Cronenberg the leader of the mafia master of the "Gyilkos promises" mafia in London.
Ray Winstone, who lost his hard-boy roles, received a Richard Harris prize for his outstanding contribution to the British film industry.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name is "Scum", "Ehkopon" and "Sex Dog" are also filming films, is currently filming the film "Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the Crescan Empire".
Winston is proud to be able to take over the award from Harris named after "Camelot" and "Hary Potter" in 2002.
"To people like me, people like me were opening doors like Richard Harris and Albert Finney" - added Winstone.
"I feel really lucky to have met Richard Harris several times.
The style of Richard Harris is close to me, and he was a great actor of his age, and I really appreciate him."
The selection of independent film prizes known as Bifa is made up of a group of filmmakers, actors and festival organisers.
For example, the Bifa's supporters and batteries include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
In Saudi Arabia 208 people were arrested in connection with terrorist conspiracy in connection with a terrorist conspiracy.
Saudi Arabia published yesterday that 208 militias involved in terrorist cells were arrested, designed to implement an imminent attack on an oil installation as well as several attacks on church persons and security forces.
According to the state television of the world's largest oil exporter, one of the cells tried to smuggle missiles through a single cell.
The Al-Qaida support campaign against Monarchia, which has been active as allies of the United States since the 2003 Iraqi invasion.
According to the television report, eight-person cells led by a foreign resident to launch an attack on an oil plant in the eastern province.
After an attack attempt by Al-Qaida, organised by Al-Qaida, the largest oil processing equipment in Abqaiq in the world, Saudi Arabia started to build a 35 000-person fast-range force for the protection of installations.
According to the Minister of Home Affairs's statement, 18 of the arrested persons have a cell that leads to a "person who is specialised in cross-border suicides" that cross borders illegally.
The report also reported that warriors have tried to smuggle eight bullets into the kingdom's territory.
22 of those in custody have developed plans for the execution of attacks against religious leaders and security forces.
The government called on the church leaders to stop the Saudis joining the Al-Qaida warriors in Iraq, who are fighting against the Muslim government of the Allied Forces and the U.S. government.
Al-Qaida’s warriors are considered to be a significant part of the military leaders of Saudi Arabia as the authorities involved in supporting the policy of the government-led royal family.
Fighters of the organization - encouraged by the call of Al-Qaida's leader, Osama bin Laden, to target the Western-friendly Saudi Government - an attack on foreign-resident settlements, government buildings and energy industries.
"The security forces have made huge efforts over the last five months", said a public television spokesperson from the Ministry of Interior.
During the arrests, Medina also caught a 16-person media cell with the aim of spreading "tafir thought". Takfir thought is the ideology of the Sunnit Muslim radicals, which supports violent action against infidel Muslims who were subjected to infidelity and belief.
There were also 32 persons who were accused of financial support for militants.
Venus's climate climate can provide an insight into the future of the Earth Earth's future.
According to scientists yesterday, Venus could once have provided pleasant living conditions.
The data of a European orbital spaceship suggest that this planet is more likely to be seen as the Earth’s entrenched twin brother than we thought before.
Venus is the nearest planet on Earth.
In terms of the size of the two planets, they are almost the same as their orbital orbit, although Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
According to scientists today, millions of years ago, the living conditions of Venus could have been very similar to that of the Earth and could have been given even housing conditions.
However, due to the highly carbon greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by solar radiation and the lower rate of rotation of the planet, Venus went on a different developmental course in a far different way.
Today, the water from the planet has been swept away, the surface temperature is hot enough to melt the lead, and hurricane - powerful winds and lightning storms are destroyed.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on a year's study on the planet, look at an outstanding picture of how the climate changes that are similar to those on Earth can develop.
Fred, Professor of Physics at Oxford University, who is one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Take a picture of why Venus's climate is so different from the Earth, despite the fact that the two planets are otherwise very similar to the structure.
"Our new data made it possible to develop a scenario on the emergence of Venus billions of years ago when it could have had similar living conditions similar to Earth.
He's a police officer who's been taken over by "enriched uranium".
A kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was recorded yesterday in Slovakia and the Hungarian police.
According to a police spokesperson, three people were arrested and three were investigated.
The speaker did not confirm whether this was a broken uranium, but stated that the substance could have been sold for $1 million (480 000).
Tight open access
Mitt Romney claims that it is not worthy of a presidential candidate to answer questions from a snowman.
However, the Republican candidates of the President's election agreed to take part in a debate on YouTube, where ordinary voters have put questions into video and forwarded them to the candidates.
None of the questions put down on the Wednesday night of November 28 were as ridiculous as the snowman who asked the Democrats about global warming in the debate on the other party YouTube.
However, the questions and answers were well reflected this time in the position of the Republican Party approaching the election next year.
It is not known at present that CNN production leaders of the co-financing of the debate had been selected by the candidates on the basis of exactly how YouTube klips were selected by the co-financed CNN producers.
The longest issue about immigration was the first half of the debate.
This theme is one of the Republicans' guerrillas.
CNN has asked some uncertain voters to call on a number of questions that, if they find it embarrassing for them, they would call on them: the mediator has experienced an agreement when the candidates have expressed a strong signal on the question of borders.
The most lively and longest debate was between Romney, a leading national-level debate between Rudy Giuliani and Romney, which was held in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the picture that he too easily addressed the issue of illegal immigration during his mayorship in New York.
He accused Romanney of hiring illegal immigrants to build his house in massusetts, the former governor of Massusetts.
The gap between the two of them was particularly intense when the questioners were interested in supporting 'amnestia' (which would ensure permanent status and the possibility of citizenship for illegal immigrants).
Some fewer candidates, such as the Kalifornia Duncan Hunter and Tom Tancredo, have managed to be thoroughly involved in this topic.
Even though none of them are likely to be able to sign, they may be explained by the fact that they were starting to hang the immigration bell sooner and louder than others.
At least there is a broad consensus between the candidates on immigration: a common objective is to strengthen borders and hard action against illegal immigrants.
This topic, like fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors from outside the world, helps to reduce or minimise the degree of confusion between the liberals and the Christian conservatives.
However, when other issues have emerged, the debate has become very unpleasant.
Giuliani had to face the question of why he had previously supported arms control in the past.
Mr McCain and Mr Romney discussed the question of whether the simulated flooding was to be considered torture.
Another question was whether candidates would believe all the words of the Bible.
On this issue, Giuliani scandald at the end of the day, in the light of the fact that although his favorite book looked at the Bible, Jonah and the whale might not be literally construed by the story of his favorite book.
Another question was whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who won his victory because of his likely Christian conservativeism, has responded to expectations that the death penalty is painful, but it is necessary to do so.
When they feared that Jesus would receive sufficient support, he said that Jesus was wiser than starting the elections.
Competition remains unusually open.
The momentum of Huckabee Iowa coincides with the efforts of the liberal Ron Paul to collect money and the enthusiasm that he will face during the Wednesday debate.
The sudden outbreak of the two candidates explains that the two wings of the party have not yet managed to launch a joint candidate among the more well-known and traditional assistants representing more well-known and traditional principles.
In 1980 and 2000 there was a candidate who brought together the party, who had a timely and convincing appreciation for the victory message about the size of America, and who found the common voice with both wings of the party.
Now, however, the party has been divided, and the consequences for now are invisible.
Working-related pains
Another gap in the matong before Gordon Brown; the way out is unchanged unchanged as the way out is not changed.
Compared to the British political scandals, the current situation does not seem too far-reaching.
No one has sold his honor; no politician has ever made his Paris hotel accounts, no one has committed an extra-marital scandal.
However, the discovery that a rich businessman, over a period of more than four years, has contributed to the Labour Party, governor of Great Britain, with an amount of more than £60,000 (1.3 million), and that this party has not reported one of the things that would have gone well without the circumcised Gordon Brown.
Two months ago, when the Prime Minister avoided the election, and when, by saying that the polls did not affect the outcome of the decision, he questioned the intellectual capacity of the British, people were still hoping that Brown would ensure a strong and effective government.
Instead, as Vice-President Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrats, noted with growing enthusiasm, became Mr. Bean, formerly feared from Brown Stalin, to Mr. Bean.
The failure to save Northern Rock's depraved bank has brought the regulatory weaknesses and the judgment deficits into a crossroads.
Specific proposals for the amendment of the tax legislation have encouraged business groups to join the government.
The loss of 25 million people's personal data by the tax authorities has been unforeseeablely revealed by a large administrative failure.
In the House of Lords there were three retired generals who protested against the reduction of the military budget, stating that the post of Minister of Defence is part-time occupation.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of the Labour Party (previously administrative leader) has resigned.
These accidents do not yet mean that Brown could not turn back on the way to the exit.
At the same time, governments can reach the point where governance is impossible.
People don't like politicians and they don't trust them, but when a new group comes to power, they usually suspend their disbelief.
However, once it becomes clear that the Prime Minister is most likely not to be able to advance things and perhaps not remain on his post for a long time, the suspended disbelief is over: the civil servant arm is starting to leak out, the ministers of the cabinet will be in the briefings, the press will look after bad news; and the government will start defending and unable to focus.
In a sense, Brown is particularly difficult because, unlike other political leaders, he does not count as "fresh blood".
As much as he wants to break down his relationship with Tony Blair, he had a right hand.
For example, the problems surrounding Northern Rock and the tax administration records are linked to decisions taken during Brown's Ministry of Finance.
And although the long-term examination of the relationship between the Blair conflict, such as the 'money gender' case and the political party financing, has not been directly involved, the voters may legitimately assume the opposite of this.
Although Brown's situation is quite unpleasant, it's not as awkward as it looks.
The abuses committed are not as scary as they appear on the market.
So did Mr. Bean, no one died, no one was taken directly into it.
And compensation - whatever pain it may be - can be created by the plans that Stalin lives in Brown: reliable, solid, and slightly hard-core governance.
For example, it is a good example of loyalty about political donation.
The Gerboian Celly Abrahams, who compares his donation to charity, reported that he did not want to make good money to the public.
Perhaps it is true that the decision was taken, but it was not his responsibility.
The law prohibiting the designation of large political supporters is clear and clear: the people have the right to know who knocks at the door of the country's leaders.
Watt, who, according to his own words, knew about Abrahams' action, was not aware of its illegal nature, will certainly be sweating during the interviews; just as Jon Medleson, founder of the Labour Party, who, in October, learned about the confusing donations.
To Brown, however, for the time being, there is no indication that he knew about these rolls, even though the payment of the huge amounts was made after he entered into the office of Brown in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of his duties.
However, he quickly condemned the crime committed by his party, but his firmness was diluted that he had touched on a familiar instrument; he entrusted a committee under the direction of a retired bishop and a judge to investigate the matter - in the interests of security - for the sake of safety - with the authority of a committee acting as a retired bishop and a judge.
In this story, "the lesson to learn" is not too complicated.
In the event of an offence, the police are competent.
Brown also needs to take care of other things, such as the appointment of the chairman of an independent committee dealing with administrative rules which has been six months without a leader or the effective reform of political party financing.
This would require cooperation from the hard-core Labour Party with the route and breaking up with special financial relationships linked to associations - this would already be a hard wall for the Reds.
But you should face some things related to the party.
According to the surveys, the conservatives are currently leading a serious advantage; Brown has two years to regain the voters behind you; the only way to win is absolute integrity and strong competence.
Cards for sharks
Are you threatening the second market mortgage market crisis in America's credit card market?
If blood falls into the water, it is natural that sharks appear nearby.
Now that the US housing market is fragile, predators are focusing on the country's credit card market.
According to the analysts of Goldman Sachs, if the mortgage crisis is affected by other forms of retail loans, the credit card market could lose up to $99 billion.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
Both the description of the ratio of unbundled loans increased, and the deficit rate of late payments beyond 30 days.
HSBC recorded a loss of 1.4 billion dollars last month in the US consumer finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of card holders.
At the same time, panic is early.
The ratio of descriptions and late payments remains low.
The rate of late payment calculated by Moody's credit rating agency for the third quarter is 3,89% lower than the historical average at a total percentage point.
The fall in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
The change in the American rules of individual insolvency in 2005 resulted in a sudden drop in the number of insolvencys, while at the same time caused large losses on the credit card market; a new increase in the number of bankruptcy applications (and this description ratio) is expected, irrespective of whether or not the total terms of credit are impaired.
The rate of payment, which shows the monthly repayment rate of consumers, is also solid in the market.
Moreover, the confidence in credit cards is also quite strong, despite the dissatisfaction created in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney at the TowerGroup research firm estimates that the volume of emissions in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage market crisis are clear to the credit card market: consumers will increase debt on credit cards to delete housing loans.
At the same time, card issuers focus mainly on cash flow and not on asset value, and therefore the fall in housing prices does not necessarily lead to changes in the credit rating of creditors.
For creditors, the situation may even benefit from it.
If the value of the property is less than the mortgage value, the incentive for consumers to write off credit is reduced; as a result, the repayment of debts on credit cards is higher in the priority priority priority.
By changing interest rates or credit limits, card issuers can adapt faster and more flexiblely to changing conditions than mortgage credit holders.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of sudden reallocation of instruments.
"It's unlikely that one day we'll wake up to completely revalue credit" says Gary Perlin, financial manager of Capital One.
If a subprime emergency crisis is less likely in the credit card market, the risk of a gradual decline is more likely to occur.
If the decline in prices on the housing market and the fall in lending lead America into a recession, the industry will no doubt face a steep future.
It's worth monitoring those predators.
British bankers declared themselves guilty of the Enron case in the case of British bankers.
On Wednesday, he confessed his guilt to the three British bankers who were brought before him for the purpose of investigating their role as former Financial Director of Enron, Andrew Faston, as a fraud.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew at the beginning of the week's fraud charge, which is that they were supposed to cooperate with Fastow in a secret fraud committed in 2000, which they wanted to make money at the cost of their employer.
Our trial started in January.
However, at a court hearing, before the U.S. District Judge, Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them acknowledged the guiltyness of the consensual fraud.
Three former employees of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group's department, Mr. Warwick NatWest, have become known in Great Britain during the two-year-long delivery process.
In the United States, the investigation of the case initiated following the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still awaiting you in the United States.
In 2002, the plea against them warned Fastow that he was one of the victims of a government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
Three brokers, charged to NatWest Three, filed against them, went to Houston in 2000 in order to prepare the fraud together with Michael Kopper, who was the right hand of Fastow and Fastow.
Fastow, responsible for planning countless frauds in Enron, also held under the control of Enron's subsidiary, who invested in Greenwich NatWest.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its existing shares in the subsidiary, but the three British men knew well that the interest was very significant.
A company managed by Kopper bought the bank a share of $1 million in the subsidiary's share of the bank's equity in the subsidiary's company.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 to get a share in this company.
According to the claim, Fastow has also reported to Enron that the energy company buys its 20 million-value subsidiary's share of the company's shares in the company's share of EUR 20 million.
But in fact, $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The claim is that the bankers made 7.3 million dollars, while Fastow, Kopper and others reached $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow confessed his two-pronged guilt for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British three were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently in jail for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
He spent three years and a month in a prison in Texas.
In the head of three English men, one million dollars could travel to the United States during the trial.
The Enron, the ever seventh largest American company, reported bankruptcy in December 2001, after the accounting tricks used for years have been unable to cover up the millions that have been accumulated as debt or as profitable but which are in fact loss-making.
The collapse has led to a loss of thousands of jobs, the market value has decreased by over $60 billion, and the value of pension funds has decreased by over $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Schilling, were sentenced last year for their part of the company's bankruptcy.
Schilling currently spends more than 24 years in prison for more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges imposed on Lay have ceased with the death of the man last year.
There is no poverty in Moscow in Moscow. There is no poverty in Moscow in Moscow.
A Gulfstream G550 aircraft equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine begins at $54 million, which takes the way between Moscow and L.A., without interruption, with a tank.
But for some Russian rich people, this amount is only a small amount of money.
"18 passengers fit in", said Dan Firer, representative of the Gulfstream.
"But no one has ordered a number of seats in it, because the machines are bought for private families or company managers."
Mr Firer was expecting visitors on the four-day, exclusive, millionaires Fair, held at the huge exhibition hall in the capital city.
In addition to the Gulfstream, over 200 other luxury delivery companies are leased to the exhibition, hoping that the Russians are interested in all the Russians, from the mahogany-coated yachts to the diamond-coated refrigerators with 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the shiny orange Porsche on the spot next to him.
"It's a nice car, but it's not worth following our products," he said.
"private aircraft are the largest market in Russia after the United States."
It seems that the Russian capital is swimming in the money like Dallas did when it was in the middle of the oil storm explosion.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some American millionaires went to Europe, these Americans were considered material here."
Like the Japanese gambling players in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s and Japan in the 1990s, Russia has now become the most visible poets in the world.
The most exclusive luxury brands demand their participation in the gold wave.
At a conference organised by the luxury industry in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnaul, the president of LVMH shared his opinion on how to sell high value products in similar markets to Russia.
(The conference was organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
According to the list of the richest people in Forbes, Russia has 53 billion people who have a total of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the number of second-class Russian millionaires reaches 103 thousand, who can receive a total of $670 billion, he established a study conducted by the economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analysed personal welfare developments in the former Soviet Union.
(The World Bank's data show that in 2005 there were 15.8 per cent of the number of people below the standard of living in Russia.)
"A hundred million lives in Moscow, that's why we're all here" said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of the London's David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole took part in the fair for the first time with the Russian dealer of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women have been provided with complete care, and men are a real treasure mine."
Two real estate market agents, 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova, and 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both owned themselves and their clients as millionaires in the evening of the evening.
"I looked at the cars and tried to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said the young Yumatova, who was astounded in his unique design clothes, as if she had been used to this drive-up.
The market was held primarily for the new banks, for the brand-oriented Russian buyers who are willing to visit a thin, cyranic decorated venue, where they can also find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum pockets, Mötenpick ice cream, ordinary billiard tables, dubai apartments and Gund plüsss macks.
For the average population, the ticket costs 30 euros (EUR 44.57).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best", said Mr Gijrath, who has taken place with regard to the Dutch china manufacturer, Royal Delft's stand, in front of a wall-sized, hand-painted, blue-painted Rembrandt copy.
"The Russians are more interested in outstanding things, of course."
Indeed, the salesmen here said that for a long time (based on the Russian stenders, that means 10-15 years) rich Russians have already been switched from the emerging logos to a bagatelli, a limited number of brands that would not enter a commercial fair.
Yet, thousands of people, including millionaires, were entrusted by millionaires, and tourists spent their time spending their time every day for suffocating.
Some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershiv, director of the King Koil Beds Company told me that he sold two mats made of silk, cashmere and cotton, gold threaded with gold thread.
Also on the night of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales associate of A1 Moto on the modern alarm for high-quality cars, reported that his company sold the bright orange Porsche to a Russian millionaire for 170 thousand dollars.
Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, had sold three refrigerators to Rolls-Royce Phantoms by Sunday afternoon. The bars were likened to connected chains and costs $15,000 each.
The reporters also showed the wheel made for the owner of a Russian casino, which they said they were using Swarovski crystals to make a roulette wheel look.
One set of four pieces is price: $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who would like to have a picture of a circus risk from his face and the hair of his wife would not necessarily use these items." said Karapetian.
"Helyette will keep them in the garage guarding 30-40 cars."
Although many Russian clients are rich, according to Karapetian, the term "orus millionaires" today does not represent a great privilege, given the sharp rise in real estate prices there.
"Who purchased real estate in Moscow four or five years ago is probably a millionaire today, if not in money, but at least on paper," he said.
"There are more than you think."
Those who were not millionaires, at least could have created the appearance of wealth before the director of the Alliance Continental Russian trust management company.
The company has built four English-style phone booths, which have been accumulated by millions of counterfeit dollar bankers.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager told me that his team printed 500 thousand counterfeit bills on millions's Buyer.
Many of the visitors stopped to play with money. Many took pictures of themselves with a mobile phone like they put in the money ring or just put a few million in the pocket.
"See, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Karryev.
A surgical malfunction is suspected to be a surgical malfunction behind a death in New Jersey, New Jersey, in the wake of a death in New Jersey.
The day before Thanksgiving was the day that Ronald Livingston looked like a small-scale restaurant on a flat-screen window and saw a rescue car stop at Cape Cod with two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
A police patrol car arrived shortly later.
Then another one.
"I saw the doctor's car stop on Wednesday," said Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors working at the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone was dead.
The authorities found out that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo.
The investigation is currently under way to determine whether death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon not identified by the police under the permission of West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arroya's death, but they hope that the result of toxicology tests that will be available in a few weeks will shed light on this mysterious death that has seriously affected the high-ranking staff of the Newark Police Department.
Arroyo, whose voice was known to many in the department, has worked as an assistant since September 2006 for the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, next to Garry F. McCarthy.
"It was real, hard and reliable" - she said in a Wednesday interview on the phone about McCarthy Arroyo.
"He was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
She told me that Mrs. Arroyo used to be a police officer in Newark, she was married to Jimmy Arroyo, who was working on the Committee on the Control of Sesame Products, and she left two, 14 and 11-year-old boys, as well as a stepdaughter after herself.
Eileen Walsh, Union County Attorney, Theodore J. Romankow's spokesperson, said that the detectives are working to determine whether Mrs Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed surgical intervention.
"The probability is high," said Walsh.
"The investigation is ongoing."
The reports from the authorities show that they arrived at the house from 3 a.m. until 3 p.m. November.
The 21st and Mrs. Arroyo were found on the couch.
He's already been reported dead at the scene.
Over a week has passed and the police have been told very little about the investigation and the owner of the house, Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't tell me if Castro had been heard by the detectives.
The participants in the study will examine whether part of the house has been functioned as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door at Castro's home, where a sneeze rose stood in the narrow garden and a lyric barked from the back of the house.
By the door leading to the basement, in the car door there was a blue tank called "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in foods and perfumes.
From hooks to double-mountain bikes on a hanging side.
She recalled when she first arrived in New York after 25 years at the New York Police Department, Mrs Arroyo was an inestimable help to her by helping her reason about the unusual and unbridled political culture of the new city.
"He always said, "He'd be better careful with this and that."" he remembered.
"She was always here when I arrived this morning, and she was still in there when I left last night.
He was in the middle of nowhere."
The expectations of Fed's interest rate cuts lead to a collapse in world stock markets.
On both sides of the Atlantic, stock prices were dropped yesterday, after the reassuring statements by the Vice-President of the Central Bank of the United States of America increased their hopes that the Fed will try to make investment opportunities easier with additional interest.
The stock markets both in London and New York and across Europe have become increasingly dominant since Donald Kohn, who has been declared the right hand of Fed-President Ben Bernande, has to respond to constant anxiety on financial markets.
In addition to Kohn's clear objective of reducing the markets in the midst of the re-occupational credit crisis, Kohn stated that "it was partly that it had rejected developments in the market at the end of September and October".
He said that if the increased confusion remained, it could increase the potential for further reductions in the credit ratings of households and companies.
The declarations were considered by investors that the Fed is ready to inject fresh capital into American markets or even further interest reductions in order to stabilise credit ratings.
The statements also reflected the calmness of Wall Street, which has recently been understood by a number of bad news about the American economy, such as a negative record of American housing sales.
The adverse effect of financial anxiety was also confirmed by the notification of Bear Stearns' investment bank that it will release 650 employees as part of the cost reduction or 4 percent of its global labour force in order to offset losses in the housing sector of the US secondary market.
The above measure concerns the total number of 20 jobs in London employed 1500.
In New York, the Dow Jones industry average index increased by 331 points, 2.55 percent, and closed at 13.289,40 points, while the larger S&P 500 index increased by 2.55 percent.
The FTSE 100 index of London increased by 165,5 points, 2.7 per cent and closed to 6.306.2, thereby increasing the value of British blue chip companies by more than 39 pounds.
The German Dax grew by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The credit market uncertainty was renewed after the high demand auction organised by the European Central Bank has reached the European banks at a price of 4.7 per cent of the price of three-month-long-term paper since April 2001.
After a steady increase in the Bank's interbank interest rate, Libor reached the highest value recorded since September, 6,59 %, the Bank of England was all under greater pressure to follow the Fed and the ECB and to provide additional capital to the London money market.
In England, the decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara is required in England.
He gave me two dilemmas, one more complicated than the other.
Who should have the English team's six meze in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara's?
And with the first test against Sri Lanka indirectly, it's no less important, who makes the decision?
On the one hand, the latter is now because David Graveney, the president of the selection team who temporarily completes this particular task, provides assistance to the leading coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughhan in the decision. On the other hand, because the account of the British Executive Director, Hugh Morris's desk, is beginning to fill in with requests for national or at least one single selection post.
Among the two players, the shorter one, which does not receive the sixth base, but as known, life and, in particular, sport is often unfair.
It's never easy to tell what reaches the top of someone's profession, while others can't get past even a lower level.
It is not only a criticism that it is difficult to choose from on a subjective basis - often on a subjective basis.
Is it time for Bopara to move forward?
Is it true for Shah if this happens?
The same question can be raised in other areas of life, for example, if we say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two smart, highly skilled young leaders of the business would be put before the decision-makers, while only one of them has a place for one of them.
Can you tell me which level is a cruiser without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious race?
Of course, the data have a great influence on the decision, but the options are equally important.
In one team, the player must catch the captain's sight at the right moment in the countdown, and a hit player should get a chance on a regular basis if he wants to become a big player once.
It's a lot more complicated to take a look at the players' eyes.
For example, more than James Anderson played better in the last season, but he still thinks he's a certain team member on the first test, even though Stephen Harmison said he's in good shape and is doing very well for him.
Anderson's 32-class first-class gate struck down and fought 33 runs to participate in the tour.
Chris Tremlett only hit 29, but they both had their successful moments at the highest level, and they hope that they will be like this in the future.
Whether Shah or Bopara will play at Asgiriya Stadium, well this will be decided on the basis of their opinions.
This decision may make or break anyone's career, but it may not have a particular impact on the future.
Four years ago Sri Lankan Gareth Batty played all the tests and performed well with five gates and 40 useful runs, but at that time Paul Collingwood was the one who became a critical and decisive test, who may still be underestimated today even though he received a double point against Australia against Australia.
It is likely that at their discussion in Asgiriya Stanion during today's game, they will put down their voks, Bopara's young lives and dynamics in front of Shah's greater experience.
There's arguments against me.
She's talking about the bright and successful debut of the 88-bombay test in the quarter of Shah, against the seven-year-old Bopara sixos of the 22-year-old Bopara, who also had an excellent screw in drums, she reached the first hundred of the 32-class.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah was at home in May, Lorda, running only ten in two quarters against West Indies, and the fact that Vaughan, who fought for it in the next game, faced the immediate resistance of the players, seemed to have reduced the endurance that still clearly appeared in Bombay.
Against him, the universal talent of the Essex is a lively and inexplicable player.
There is nothing to be upset about on the cruise track, but his out-of-field behaviour was well described when at an exhibition, the car sponsor of the team, Volkswagen, had a four-wheel drive from a four-wheel drive.
However, the first thing he did after was to hold the phone of Vodafone (naturally sponsored) and called his teammate Alastair Cook, Alastair Cook, to ask him, "Have you seen this?"
Bopara is a right-wing player with a well-dressed medium-step lead angle, and his punches are confident and clever.
Chooseing the right person is one thing and another for the right moment.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
Personally, I'd give Bopara a chance, which doesn't mean I don't think Shah would give a great deal if, as the ceylon notes suggest, he's the one who's playing this weekend.
They transport the refugees home with a fight with Al-Qaidaida and their Al-Qaidaid and Al-Qaida and Al-Qaida. They're transporting the refugees home with a lot of money to work and take up the fight with Al-Kaida Al-Qaidaa and Al-Qaida.
Since yesterday they have arrived in Baghdad from Syria, the first buses with Iraqi refugees who have lost their money or had their visa expired, or they are actually those who hope that the order has returned to the city.
There are some of them who have returned to fight with the soldiers who pulled them from their homes.
The bus station in Mansour has already been filled with refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a 800-person government conn arriving from Damascus to load dozens of buses.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubai's Sunnit doctor.
"I came back today because I saw what happened in Baghdad on TV and newspapers and that the city is now safe.
"It is said that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he added, referring to Moqda al-Sadr milicist priest who has now stopped his ski army.
The 38-year-old ski teacher, Qassim al Atwani, from Amariyah, mostly from the Sunnis, returned home with two children because he failed to renew his Syrian visa and because the regime there prevented the Iraqis to work.
Amarai's ski neighbors called him and urged him to return, saying that with the help of troops supported by the Americans, Al-Kaida was able to squeeze Al-Kaida out of their hardship on the western side of the capital.
One of the first people from Jordan was a Sunnit and Siita tribe leader who escaped from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad, Finland, after he started encouraging his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
He came back to fight.
"A few days ago, my friends called and told me that they created an Al-Qaida anti-Milisia in Sleikh, and they need to support me and my sons.
That's why I came back today," said the 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many people have talked about the fact that, since the American troops were involved, strengthened peace and armed civilian forces, working with the Americans, have lured them home.
But more people were forced to return from Damascus due to visa and financial problems.
The 51-year-old three-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai expressed a widespread view of the fact that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked the Syrian Government to reject the refugee visa application to force them to return.
They believe that more than two and a half million people have escaped the nation's death squad.
"It was okay until Al-Maliki made a visit to Syria and put pressure on the government to avoid issuing more visas for Iraqis in order to make them move home", said the Sunnita retired.
"I can't trust a government that supports criminals who burned down my house after I escaped."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence was that sunnits were expelled from the ski areas, while the skis also left the Sunnitian rural areas, resulting in a number of rural declines of tensions.
Many people fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will reinvigorate the castles, which may even lead to further battles.
Kis Saar Saar-nea - Short training training training training
The smallest federal state is leading to vocational training and higher education, and also international orientation.
Only one field of training is the island regions with the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I explained to an outside of Saar every day 50 times that we are not French" - this is on the posters of the self-Romanian slogen for the 50th anniversary of the smallest federal province.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system in the Saar Country, which, on the basis of the surveys of the German Economic Institute (IW), is the fifth place where they can work.
In this way, higher education institutions are working closely with neighbouring countries because of tradition only.
The University of Aarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To date, students can complete their studies with two or more triple diplomas.
Accordingly, a higher proportion of foreign students is 15.6% of them.
However, many of them do not have high-school education in many of them, many of them do not have an average attraction to those who want to study in the island.
"The opportunities of vocational training are used in the Saar region" explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert at the German Economic Institute.
Young people gain further education in more than a fifth degree school, with more than seven percent higher than the federal average in Saarland.
The combined opportunities for vocational and higher education have also been well established.
In the second place, the infrastructure for double studies is located in Germany in terms of the number of population.
Despite the practical training and growing interest, the number of graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the island has therefore committed to a marketing campaign of higher education institutions with the focus of engineering scientists.
"In general schools, we have initiated a number of reforms following the first Pisa study," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has conducted comparative tests across the country.
To allow children to start learning early, the last year of school is free of charge. It is a model that, in the meantime, other federal provinces began to copy.
Whether students' performance will improve permanently will only answer future comparative studies.
On the basis of the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the proportion of students at risk increased from 29 to 20 per cent from 29 to 20 per cent.
Overall, however, the performance of the island region has not improved to the extent that other federal provinces have improved.
The nightmares count better.
The greatest revenge of the island regions during the Pisa problem is that they do not take into account the recognition of foreign languages - otherwise, in this area, they could reap bees,
Since the languages of the neighbouring countries are binding in the high schools - even if the island regions are not French.
Chávet converts watches to clocks.
In Venezuela, hours are different from those of the rest of the world in the near future.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will turn back the timing in Latin America for half an hour.
Meanwhile, Chávez in Spain became the subject of a laugh.
As stated in the official page of Venezuela, hours are being turned back four and a half hours compared to the time of Greenwichi under a new law.
Thus, South America will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country of the world.
Among other things, the United States Anti-Cávez has justified its decision to force all hours-based time zones to the world by means of the United States of America.
In addition (at local time) he announced on Wednesday the interruption of relations with neighbouring Colombia due to a hostage.
The nationalist politician on the left has stated that until the conservative Alvaro Uribe remains president of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian Government, is in contact with the government of Colombia.
"I can't do this for my own dignity," said Chávez, who calls for a constitutional reform that the citizens of the country of oil must have an opinion within the framework of a referendum on Sunday.
With reform, its power would be significantly strengthened in the country.
The root cause of the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez's mandate to negotiate with Colombian Marxist rebels the release of hostages.
Uribe made his choice of "Arcul kuppete" Venezuela, giving his criticism of Chávez on Sunday.
Everyone in Spain is talking about Chávez.
In the country, a new mobile voice sounded like "Por Qué no te cellas" (Why don't you shut up) - that's what the sentence that more than half a million people have downloaded from the Internet themselves.
The sentence comes from Charles, King of Spain, which was so upset at the last Latin America summit by the constant intervention of the Baloldic populist politician by his words.
In 2007 Germans were threatened by the Germans with a reduction of wages in 2007 and women in Germans.
It is estimated that this year German workers will be threatened by real wages, despite the strong conjunctivism of German workers.
Experts have supported their pessimistic forecast with a limited number of reasons.
According to an Ans-Bröckler-Approval, in 2007 employees may actually pay less than in the previous year.
"This is due to modest wage development, increase in general turnover tax and a rapid increase in food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn, a member of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Conjunctural Research.
There may also be additional burdens on workers in relation to unemployment insurance.
In a statement by the Minister of Finance, Mr Peer Steinbrück stated in his statement to the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the current situation would reduce right and reasonable unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent at the beginning of the new year.
In all cases, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be put in such a difficult situation to apply for credit or support for the alliance, the German Socialist Party, the SPD politician, was quoted as the German Socialist Party.
It became known on Tuesday that the price explosion of food and mineral oil products resulted in the highest inflation over 13 years.
In a yearly comparison, prices increased by a total of 3 per cent.
Venus is the Earth's devil's twin brother.
Despite the harsh atmosphere of Venus, it is more like the Earth than it has been assumed: In the air, the lightning flashes of the European "Venus Express" space probe and the poles have been discovered by winds than in the winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists assume that the Venus flashes.
The "Venus Express" space probe in Europe has provided evidence of electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere: the lightnings occurring in Venus range from a cloud to a cloud at a height of 56 miles [56 km] in the spheres, reporting on the abdomen of the scientific magazine "Nature", Christpher Russell, a co-worker from the University of California of Loss Angeles.
According to the famous "old theory", the creation of Earth's life has been created by lightnings: according to the theory, the Explosives have started reactions in the ocean that led to the development of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so the Venus: "If there's ever been a life there, it could be in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Currently there is hardly any living organism on the Venus surface: The atmosphere is one hundred times thicker than on Earth, and temperature values sometimes reach 500 degrees.
"There may be Venus to the world's hell twin brother, but he's still his twin brother," said Russel.
The main question of sending Esa is why Venus is so similar in mass and size to Earth on a different course of development in its entirety.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus research because no probe has been on the road since the early '90s to explore this planet.
According to researchers, the latest research results presented in several "Nature" articles show not only the uniqueness of Venus's solar system.
"They also point out that the likeness of the neighboring planet to Earth is greater than we thought it was first," said Esa.
In addition to the already known North-Sarki Round, researchers discovered a cloud-scan moving much faster on the South Pole.
The phenomenon reminds us of the air currents of the winter hemisphere of the Earth, says the research group led by Giuseppe Piccion from the Italian Institute of Istituto di Astrophysica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second largest planet in the solar system is almost the same as the Earth's, and it is almost as large as the Earth's diameter of 12 or 100 kilometres.
The celestial body also called the Elevator Star will avoid the sun in less than 225 days.
However, it turns much slower around its own axis: it lasts for a ancient day 243 Earth days.
Although the 460 Celsius surface temperature matching with the pressure of Venus 92 bar barely reminds the Earth, scientists are starting to think that both planets were born under conditions that were entirely similar to those of the same nature.
On both of them, the water that remained on Earth as an ocean until he left on Venus into the universe.
And while CO2 on Earth was tied to carbon dioxide, Venus is a major part of this atmosphere.
To protect Köhler Köhler, Merkel is taking up a meeting with the Dalai Lama Dalai Lama with Dalai Lama Dalai Lám with Dalai Lama.
Köhler, President of the German Republic, calls for the end of the dispute between the parties which occurred during the reception of Dalai Lama in the Chancellorial Office of the Dalai Lama.
In fact, he applied the SPD with criticism for attacking the Chancellor after the September reception.
The President of the German Republic Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany's authority and called on the grand coalition to close the debate about the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this matter we should not be seen as a divided nation towards the outside world," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt tab.
At the same time, Köhler expressed his understanding of the fact that Angela Merkel received the Dalai Lama in September.
"The human rights of me are universally valid even if I respect the diversity between cultures," said Köhler.
He is aware that Germany must take due care of the foreign policy balance, emphasised the President of the Republic; however, Merkel has been given protection against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Chancellor didn't break the traditional Chinese policy."
China is aware of that," said Köhler.
Mr Frank-Walter Steinmeier indirectly expressed his voice over his failure to receive Dalai Lama, and therefore became the target of attacks in the Union's lines.
Mr Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the EU's 'Pacific Policy' in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor's Office, there were severe disturbances in the German-China situation.
Thus, the Chinese leadership not only rejected the invitation of the German Minister for Finance (SPD) but also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the two countries, according to the information provided by SPIEGEL.
Mr Wen Jiao Chinese Head of State has now called on Ms Merkel Federal Chancellor for failure to receive the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the Chinese position Wen Jiabao in their official capacity as religious leader of Tibetans.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed out that he was trying to break up other Tibetan areas including Tibet and other provinces today.
Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those in France.
Cute fires with the police, shootings, flinging cars: Brigang Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those in France.
Everything must be done to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not interfere with street violence, requires the Federal Minister for the Interior to do so.
The barriots were on fire, randomiseds shot with beer rifles for police officers: After serious problems with young people in France, it comes from similar developments in Germany by the Federal Minister for the Interior of Brigang Schäuble (CCU).
"We need to consider that social explosives should not be collected from us and should not be subjected to violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" newspaper in Hanover.
Not all young people are right about the rapid changes in social reality.
Federalities and communities are currently working intensively on solving problems, said Schäuble.
This is not only about the integration of immigrants.
The first successes are now emerging from the Integration Summit to the Islamic Conference.
However, it is too early to resolve the emergency.
Schäuble, at the same time, pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems such as in France in the German suburbs.
In the northern suburbs of Paris last night, young people fought serious street battles with the police.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings were flamed.
In view of this, in terms of integration, a greater degree of activity has been required by the federal government, Kian Kolat, head of the German Turk Communitys.
In the context of the disturbances in France, Kolat warned me about the "harvest dangers of persecution".
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as in France,
However, action is necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people aged 25 years from immigrant families, the unemployment rate was "higher than average".
In particular, more education should be provided.
Kolat stressed: "We need to give young people a better perspective."
However, the leader of the Turkish Community added that "the social surveillance within the family" in Germany is much more present than in France.
In addition, many young people from immigrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat warns: "We must stand still."
For young people, "the quicker they need to ensure that they have a job and receive education".
Meanwhile, during the night there was complete rest in the suburbia of Paris, Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of cops were ready to take off, and a helicopter sent a light light light on the surface.
The competent authorities have reported three arrests and a few flames of trash and a car.
Since the reporting, a single safety unit of 1000 persons has been responsible for rest.
The police are ready for intervention as long as it is necessary to report to Michelle Alliot-Marie's Minister of State after he visited the suburbs.
During the night of Tuesday cheerleading, 80 police officers were injured.
The next night the interference spread to Toulouse.
The revolutions have been hit with a traffic accident in which two young people have lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the state's first findings, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the reigning realm of Angela, the reigning realm of the Great Empire of Angela.
His reaction from the Chancellor's reality is proof that the coalition is going to end - and nothing is expected from him.
Actually, what country does the Federal Chancellor live in?
After having done so, in the general debate of the Bundestag, it must be established that it is not here - it is not in the country whose governance would have to do with it.
He rejected the charge with a very modest sentence from Angela Merkel that he was too focused on foreign policy.
It's provincative, she answered, and in this way she only explained that she didn't want to understand what the critics were saying about her.
The Federal Assembly made it clear to everyone how good eye-sucking is.
Meanwhile, neither specific interest nor empathy was known for the country's problems.
Instead, Angela the Clouder appeared: a politician who is a politician of reality who flees to foreign policy and is only his own uncertainty there.
Example of climate protection: Heiligendammi is praising himself for decisions, but he listens to how the clearing goals should be achieved in the country.
As far as the self-esteem is concerned, it would have been two years ago that the President of the CDU would not have allowed himself to be his secretary-general.
Now he's getting into the frustration that prosperity has a positive effect on humans.
By doing so, it harms the good reputation of a pragmatic personality, which offers solutions to problems rather than the so-called flowers.
However, the problems of internal politics in the emerging Kingdom of Angela are only minor things.
Is there a problem with poverty and low incomes?
It's just for a few half words.
It is a great thing to say in terms of the frequency of language breakdowns in the case of family replacements.
Merkel has to hang out three times to bring together a semi-league sentence for a half time.
If there are particulars, he's out there in a foreign area.
Roham case class
In the course of the debate on the Republican presidential candidates on Youtube, the two Favori, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney have been subjected to a severe blow - and they must now be held from an outside candidate.
The tension of candidates is already surfaced with regard to the first subject.
Mitt Romney says to the opponent, Rudy Giuliani, that he made New York "a lifeguard for illegal immigrants".
For his own serious facts: "I would say that his own house has been providing asylum for illegal immigrants", cuts back to Giuliani, and throws it into the eyes of the former governor of Massachusetts, who has been employed as a private person by undocumented immigrants.
Candidates are starting to attack: Since the Republican camp still has no consistent support for its Favorite, the eight presidents will use the debate on CNN in order to undermine their opponent's credit.
30 seconds of own filming videos sent by internet users via Youtube are hardly more than short summarys.
"With this kind of isolationism, we brought Hitler to power," he rubs John McCain under the nose of Ron Paul, who demands immediate exit from Iraq as the only one of the participants in the circle.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by Vietnam's vet when he is tempted to judge "Waterboarding" as torture, the method of interrogation in which the flooding is simulated.
While the important topics of the campaign are still beyond the debates on Iraq and torture, it is demonstrated by the reactions of the St. Petersburg audience in Florida.
There is a voice in the room when the conservative values are glorified and when future tax increases are rejected.
Meanwhile, the two candidates are increasingly showing their weaknesses.
"I was wrong about that," Romney, a media criminal, and she apologized to the sponsors and television viewers for dropping the voksa in 1994, while she was still in the middle of the pregnancy break-up.
However, Giuliani is moved to ask for his opinion on the Bible’s literal interpretation.
Musharraf was the first government leader of Musharraf as a civilian civilian.
One day after the military's retreat, it took place to become President Musharraf, who has been in Pakistan's capacity to exercise authority as President of Musharraf.
This will put an end to eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
A further five-year term of office for the Pakistani President, Pervez Musharraf, took place on Thursday.
Pakistani television from the capital, live from the palace of the President of Islamic Republic, broadcast the ceremony.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to act in the best interests of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military chief's office to Ashfaq Kiyani, and so he allowed international pressure from the United States to come before everything else.
After eight years of defeating the former general, after breaking into military coup d'état power, he is now now ruling as Head of State for the first time.
Musharraf, by returning as Commander General of the Armed Forces, has fulfilled a fundamental claim of the West and the opposition.
Further important demand is the abolition of the emergency situation announced by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to DG Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will soon be eliminating the exceptional situation of the West with a further demand.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf introduced, at the beginning of November, advocating lawyers with him, has refused to protest in any case last week about the appeal of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four more injured as a result of an attack on a military commander in northern Pakistan.
According to the information provided by the military spokesperson, the bomb exploded on a road close to the Afghan border.
Fathers of the krautrock are returning.
With music again, the seven-year German Super Team: The three gang members of Harmonia have re-run his instrument until the end of a Berlin concert.
On the occasion of the reconstruction, a cut recording appears from their light age, the time of "Live 1974".
They were already well known abroad at that time.
The declared sensation is the body of the three consensual gentlemen present at the dinner table in person.
Before each one of its own instruments, its own cables and all its own buttons.
Dieter Moebius is in the middle of a white shirt with its 63 years of age.
From Left to age 57, Michael Roth, who thinks he's young, will be accompanied by a laptop and guitar.
From the audience, your 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius curves and concentrates on the console.
Each of them produces some kind of noise, and once or twice a rhythm.
And sometimes this is about to form a traditional music.
However, this does not seem to bother your masters much.
It was a great pleasure for the lovers of the Krautrock Music Management that the Harmonia band played again with music.
What we can tell you here: As a result of the proper procedure, we can say that the name has fallen through the collective pop monument, but in no case has left any permanent evidence that this band will be painfully missed after 32 years.
But why should the Germans not celebrate their living legends of their 70s?
In particular, what we call a misguided Krautrock has always been appreciated more in England and America than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for the living members of the cologne Can band in 2003, the figures of the German pop in the room sat with an unintelligible face.
When he even thanked La Dusseldorf and Neu! in the Red Hot Chili Peppers presentation, the surprise became unlimited.
At the concerts, Michael Roth used to sit on stage as an old friend of his Red Hot Chili Peppers.
Two sides of domestic rejection and foreign acceptance on the same coin.
The memory is already overloaded by Harmonia because the trio existed for only two years, and during this time it has had a far lower impact than others have already attributed to it.
Moebius and Roedelius used to play with Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising cluster name Cluster.
At the beginning, they played in the basement under the Schaubühne Theatre in Berlin.
Then in Dusseldorf, for economic reasons, to a record company financed by the Church.
Roth helped the Kraftwerk band for a short time, and in parallel, it may have been the most radical German band, Neu!, as a guitar player.
However, in 1973, Roth followed Custer’s musicians into their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weserhof, they lived in a 16th century Rom as a comedian who escaped from town.
Less ideologically ideologically than the commune I, where Roedelius was in trouble as a baby-sitter.
Their lives are more like an idly artistship.
It is said that the flag of the song of Harmonia Otenstein was made out of garbage, and that is how they found their name art.
Some things recorded by these Harmonia.
The first album is called "Musik von Harmonia" and "De Luxe."
Despite his soft and modest music, the band has suffered material needs.
The stock collection alone did not provide for finding themselves.
The CD on "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert held in Griesem, in front of an audience with a record of only 50 people, so someone remembers.
At that time, Harmonia was an idea for Roth.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is an immoral claim.
The band announced its division in 1975.
Roth ended up at the esoteric and held himself from albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster has been reborn in the 1980s, which has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
The real album of Grisemmi is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record company, who was listening to Greenland, pointed out that he's taking care of the Krautrock as a special German ad from the living music.
In the same way, Neu! has been promoted as well as its work on Roudelius.
Harmonia will be raised at the House of Berlin Cultures.
In cash, within the framework of the "Woldtronics Festival".
Julian Cope, British ancestor and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler" are also present.
This is also the owner of Love Parade, Dr. Motte.
All of this is broadly summed up by the effects of Krautrock on the subsequent Popzenei era.
In this regard, Harmonia will fill out the empty space reserved for the Super Team.
The determination of Brian Eno, along with the most unusual voices, lies in the room: "The only true music, the only true music, is the future."
There are pictures of the producer who is photographed with Harmonia in the room of a farmhouse.
The drawing of additional black and white photographs of cabled equipment in the cosage serves to make legends.
In the foreground, the three veterans are re-introduced by improvisation.
This only means that microphones are fixed to the organ and drum equipment with the intention that the instrument itself has not yet heard sound effects by means of its own escalating instruments.
Today, electric music looks like electric music.
Three deep-tech barbequests.
All this doesn't change anything about the cabin.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenster, they cough and muffle and sing "Aaaaaah" in a beautiful part.
Because Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was never about the rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in the Academy of Music (Can), in technical knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the runaway from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
If someone here calls out "68", he doesn't go in the wrong way, and Harmonia doesn't even leave you out of your mind right now.
Even the most self-evident thing on stage is carefully considered.
Where does the music start, and where does the music end?
This can neurologize a man, or he can provide you with the moments of the passing of exceptional fortune.
Richard Gere simply isn't quite cynical enough.
Through "The Hunting" and "Mörderischer Frieden", two films deal with the Balkan war again.
However, none of them are convincing.
The basic idea is too much for action and shooting or too emotional.
Even now, Richard Gere can't help you with "The Hunting".
First of all, although the two war criminals, Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, there it was found again in the dark background of the war in Bosnia, in Richard Gere, the actor.
In recent times, we have missed the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because the many good-y-nomous roles of women in emotional movies and many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have taken our pleasure in looking at it.
And all of a sudden, Richard Gere is the most obvious argument in addition to perhaps even seeing the "During" film.
It offers a wonderful, smiling design: In essence, Simon Hunt, who has been formed by him, is exactly what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not as generous as: A man whose most years have been behind him, but his decline as a romantic monument, still retains a significant part of his former charm.
However, even in spite of this gift, the production of the movie "Company" and the German "Mörderischer Frieden" started this week, only the endless series of lost films about the war in Balkans continues.
The film "Mörderischer Frieden" does not have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adriian Topol, Max Riemel), who saves a Serbian woman from Kosovo, and one of them suddenly loves her.
It is welcome that now the Serbs are not portrayed as all the evil sole causings, the film that makes the film too low is lost too quickly in shooting and eventful scenes.
"Cobra 11" is carrying a star with a war instead of a highway.
On the other hand, it can be considered in the case of the "Company" model why, in fact, no really good film has been made of war in the Balkans.
The story of the three United States Military Researchers, who are turning up to explore the Serbian war criminal called "Róka" with another director, another writer, another writer (both in Richard Shepard's personic Union) could have become a new "Apocalypse now" at another time.
The stories show a surprising similarity: In either case, small groups will cut him into the forest to do what the army is unable - and in both cases, the journey to madness is rounding up.
One of the reasons for the fall of "The Hunting" is that he simply does not allow Simon Hunt to be a fallen cynical who listens to his heart, as he shows him at the beginning.
No, and as a matter of fact in the script, she's still spending a romantic relationship with a woman who was later murdered with a woman of Muslim Bosnians.
"The Hunting" will disappear forever when the reporters in the last five minutes of the movie reached what NATO, CIA and all the head hunters of the world were unable to do in five years: they will take the war criminal to hand him over to the Mohammed witches for fair revenge.
It's so bad that you'd rather go to the Hague International Criminal Tribunal for a crime against the logic of cinema.
But the purpose of the film is profoundly human.
He intends to call it a clown that Karajics and Mladics are still on the loose and that he suspects the Americans and the French (which is said to be exceptionally uniform) that, due to secret political deals, they do not continue to pursue persecution intensively enough.
But good and evil sometimes look so similar to each other that a man can think of a famous Brecht-vers.
Here the poet writes of the horrid horde of an Asian demon on his desk: "I look on my stomach at the whirlwinds, which tells us: "What a pain to be a bad person".
Movies such as the "The Hunting" have the same oversized, man-shaped masks, but they show how exhausting it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the art of films about the Balkans war.
Recently, the paper reported that all of the film on Hollywood, Iraq, was a nasty fall.
We can add: There is not yet any good film about South Africa.
It's almost always true: If a star walks around the world's crisis scenes or minefields, it's like "The Ways of Freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "Without the Dead" Angelina Jolie or "The Blood Diamond" with Leonardo Di Caprio.
It is possible that these conflicts may still be too close to time.
They had to do decades until Hollywood was able to film a good movie from the holocaust with the movie "Scndille list" from the holocaust.
Some films are probably still available - since the works of the Vietnam War, which are now classics, such as "the deer hunter", "Apocalypse now", or "Full Metal Jackett", have not been celebrated in their time as a master piece.
However, it may be that nowadays, when any terrorist attack is in real time, it is coming right through two screens to our home, we simply know too much about the world's conflicts.
And that deprives the writer of ignoring reality, which would be necessary to tell the good stories.
Because "Lenn or not" or "The dictator" finally made it so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin had not yet known how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you should not try to make a good film.
Perhaps the novelist Lawrence Norfolk needs to be placed in a sarcasticly distant artistic vision.
When he was fascinated about the historical novel "Lemprière-lexikon" and the parallels between the war in the Balkans, he replied: "It only depends that certain things never change.
Major cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia."
Von Bestust is strongly criticised for the resignation of the Olympic Olympics.
The mayor's decision to hold the Olympic Games in Hamburg was a serious criticism in political and economic life from his proposal for the organization of the Olympic Games in the summer of Hamburg.
Many people want to continue fighting for the maintenance of water games.
However, Von Beust is strongly warned of reality during the odds struggle.
On Wednesday of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Director-General Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, declared the withdrawal to the 'economic environment' as favourable.
No other project has recently released such enormous motivation forces in the city than the Olympic idea.
"With this aim, we could not maintain the momentum of sport policy."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to develop a long-term initiative "from modified time coordinates".
In addition to his previous statements by Mayor von Beust, the ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg are not realistic until at least 2028.
"This is not Hamburg's decision on the Olympics competition, but the German Olympic Sports Association", said von Beust to WELT ONLINE.
At the end of December, the Sport Association decided on the München tender for the Olympic Games in the winter of 2018 for the Olympic Games.
"The advantage for us means that we will not have real chances within the period that we have so far thought up to 2028."
Nevertheless, we do not give up the dream permanently, says von Beus.
The Hamburg Sport Association (HB) has expressed its regret over the statements made by Bestus.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will not intend to compete for Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It is too early to blow up an opportunity to bury our plans now," said Günter Ploß, President of HSB on Wednesday.
The withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement by the President of the Senate, which was received at the general meeting of the General College of Germany's Sports Association.
For this reason, the application submitted by Von Best Hamburg to the 2015 Univerziadéra showed that it was not a substitute for the Hamburg Olympic Games.
The College Sports Association has launched Hamburg as a city participating in the competition only last week.
The civilian section of the SPD called upon the Senate to leave a valuable time in terms of housing construction in Hamburg unexploited.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because he was in the middle of the Olympic Games and he was missing the building building", said two SPD representatives, Carol Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to focus on Kleiner Grasbrook in addition to an integrated plan for Olympic and later residential exploitation, the CDU unilaterally placed its emphasis on the "actual factor".
The invitation to tender for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games was a great pleasure in Hamburg at that time.
However, Hamburg Lipcsén failed.

Who connects Swedish and wall concepts to each other is Ikea, not Andy Warhol.
Are you?
Currently, walls produced in Sweden are putting a dark shadow on the list of Warhol's works.
The ninety-four "Stockholm type" Brillo Box is a big part of a fake.
After a few months after the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned Andy Warhol's originality in 1968, the internal investigation of Stockholm's Moderna Museum has now reached an exorcist conclusion: In 1995, by Pontus Hultén, former museum director Moderna Museet donated six copies of "Brillo Box" and most likely to be one hundred more "Stockholm types" of Brillo Box on the international art market.
The history is a long and complicated chain of artistic and Kuratory patterns that interferes with the history.
In War 1964, New York, he created the first "Brillo Box" - paintd walls based on a red-and-white format box of "Brillo" soap.
At its exhibition in Moderna Museet in 1968, hundreds of Brillo lads were drawn from a map made from the agreement of Warhol: They were not delivered from Warhol (for reasons of cost savings) but directly from the Brillo Carton Factory.
It wasn't about art, it was about their templates, it was about simple exhibition pieces.
At the same time, Warhol 1968 authorised the production of some of the Brillo walls in Sweden, which were not produced in Moderna Museet.
The witnesses of the age are now talking about round fifteen boxes that were then certified as Original-Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Box under the designation "Stockholm Type" in the art and auction event.
Some of them were sold for over $100 000.
The problem is, however, that Pontus Hultén, the legendary museum director later claimed that in 1968 hundreds of walls were manufactured and made out in Sweden, which was then left to Warhol.
In fact, Hultén's 105 crates were produced only in 1990 in Malmö for a sacred-pétervár exhibition in Malmö.
However, at that time, Warhol has been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, the main monumentist of Moderna Museet, also examined three Swedish private boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: The printed pages were first printed and cut down, followed by the white oil painting.
In contrast to the structure of the copies from 1990, it is reported that the paint was taken directly onto the screen - not even oil, but acrylic paint.
"These boxes were not certified by the artist, so they should be deleted from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo's Boxes", says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museum, "until New York 'Andy Warhol Art Authority Board' decides otherwise, Moderna Music will list six boxes as a copy/output material in its collection."
Of course, the Athentication Board has already announced in June that it would examine "serious charges" raised in relation to soap powder boxes.
However, they have been forced to remain silent since then.
Manilai rebel soldiers will give up.
The rebels were given up in the Philippines by soldiers who barricaded themselves at a hotel in Manila and demanded that President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo be harmed.
He can't take responsibility for bloodshed, reported to reporters at the hotel leader Antonio Trillane, who accused the president of corruption and election fraud.
Before that, the hotel was attacked by government-powered soldiers who had been using gas for the first time.
Two dozen soldiers have been barging themselves in the building for hours.
Half of the team was court-martialed on Thursday, 2003 due to failed coup attempt, including Trillanes.
He used the trial to suddenly release a wheel with 30 symposias.
The military police officer responsible for the guarding of the man obviously turned to him and joined the party.
They entered the Peninsula-Hotel and then called for the rejection of President Arroyo of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Command units have closed down the surrounding area of the hotel foreman.
The president called the Security Department for an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales' security advisor has condemned the military's procedures.
"They have enough for people," said Trillane.
"Let's call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, formerly commander of the Scout Rangers elite, stated that the other units of the army wanted to join the process within a short time.
On Friday the critics of the government called for a strong protest against the president.
His government has been shielded by corruption charges for several months.
The financial district of Manila was already the main feature of the campaign against Arroyo organised by 200 members of the army.
The uprising failed only 24 hours in the past when the army was reluctant to join.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet is going to be a major shareholder in Versatel, United Internet.
United Internet provided you with more than 20 percent share in Versatel's telecommunications company.

The two companies are initially satisfied with a good 10 percent stake in Freenet and do not have the right to take over another 18,49 percent of Freenet, reported on Thursday the United Internet.
However, the two companies leave all the options open, especially in view of increasing their share in Freenet AG, word is news.
The negotiations between United Internet and Freenet were concluded in the middle of November on the strategic partnership.

At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2,9 million contractual mobile telephone clients and 1,27 million DSL customers with fixed access.
As far as the United Internet and the holding company Drillisch are concerned, the holding company has already held a stake of 6,01 per cent in Freenet.
