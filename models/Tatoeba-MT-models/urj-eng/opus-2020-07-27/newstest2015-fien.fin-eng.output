Putin: Ukrainian troops are firing civilians who shoot civilians.
Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev of refusing direct political discussions with the Separatists of East Ukraine on Monday.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct a substantial political debate with the eastern part of its country, Putin said according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, whom Kiev and the West say were assisted by the Russian army, were trying to push Ukrainian troops further away from the moments in which Putin said that Ukrainian army troops were shooting civilians.
The aim of the militia is to push away these armed forces and their troops so that they do not get a chance to shoot the inhabitants of the area, Putin said.

Selection: Super Rahem út - Mario was left in the shadow - Valioliiga - Ilta-Sanomam - Ilta-Sanomat
The 19-year-old Raheem Sterling showed again why he was considered the hope for the future of English football.
On Sunday, White Hart Lanella had an electronic atmosphere when Liverpool, confirmed by Mario Balotelli, arrived at Tottenham as a guest.
Super Mario's first performance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field with a different attitude from Manchester City time to time.
Balotelli was still a long way from his peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality destinations and fed only half of its six to their own team.
Half-farmers who have already preferred the player will wait for better in the future.
Liverpool-managing Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli in Barcelona, traveling to Luis Suarez as the second attack on the team alongside Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotel, the team's aim was to turn the middle-field diamond to the head of Raheem Sterling, who had a 3-0 victory over the important opening field of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, it doesn't just look like it's on its own.
The Englishman, which is 20 cents shorter than Balotelli, is among the lines of the opponent than in the water of the fish.
The feature is not a general player who thanks the lawn at its best for about 34 kilometers per hour.
The Rodgers also deserves great thanks for the development of Sterling.
After the match, the North American told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the creative chair that grew along with Wembley.

Ovar cancer of the ovarian cancer is reported to be more frequent deaths due to delayed diagnosis and reduced access to treatment, due to delayed diagnosis and reduced access to treatment, due to late late diagnosis and reduced access to treatment,
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published a video for honor to his mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia have a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers went through the patient data of more than 1100 Australian women who had received ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2005 and noted that only 35% of women, i.e. more than five years after diagnosis, were reported.
Chief Research Officer Susan Jordan QIMR from the Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in rarely populated and remote areas were 20 % more likely to die during the investigation than women living in urban areas.
INFORMATION: New medicines may slow lung and ovarian cancer to slow down.
The researchers went through the women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also contributed to the possibility of survival.
In older women and when cancer was more widespread, the probability of survival was lowest.
In rare and distant areas, women died by 20% more likely during the investigation than women living in urban areas.
The investigation did not attempt to find out why women living outside the city have a less likely chance of surviving ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers possible causes of delayed diagnosis and reduced access to treatment.
"Gyneological oncology specialist doctors treat this disease best, and their reception is mostly located in large cities," says Jordan.
While remote services are becoming more common and the importance of distance is reduced, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialised doctors can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients away from home.
According to Dr. Jordan's study, long-term survival rates for women with ovarian cancer are low regardless of geographical location, which highlights the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer funded research is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a family mother, who was 33 years old, lived in Gold Coast, experienced malignant ovarian cancer.
The town of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the station map for a sleek park in the Centre Park, which is located next to the hotel in the Northjyanhov.
The city government decided on Monday that the proposal for a position plan for the park and its surrounding environment would be set up in Osvitta, a public service point for Osvitta.
The draft is submitted for opinions from the Environment Committee and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the help of the Stationary Force Change, the city wishes to enable tourism to continue in the area of motor-skilling activities related to tourism.
It is intended to form a park area that holds within the area between the current Love Park and the river and the area between it and the river.
According to the submission, no more than 200 snow-rollers shall be permanently allowed for the period from 15 November to 30 April.
The designated part of the area may also be located in refuelling points.
In addition, service is permitted for the new park area.
The town of Rovaniemi has rented an area of friendship park for safari companies during the winter season for the use of snow-skating equipment.
The lease agreement has been last renewed in spring 2014 and is in force in spring 2018.
Kelkkaparking and design change have also caused serious opposition.
The residents of neighbouring areas have been nervous about voting as well as worrying about emissions.
However, the area's emissions have been analysed, and the studies have not shown any evidence beyond the guide values.
In addition, new equipment is lower than old emissions.
Moreover, if the place of departure was moved further away, the safari customers should be transported to the safari places of departure by buses, which would be estimated to be 15 departures per day.
The area and the surroundings of the park of friendship are also wide enough for the poles, better than the places for replacement destinations, such as the east side of the river bridges.
The park of friendship is good for its location because the activities can be extended to the Ounaspaviling region, for example, in the future.
The consolidation of park activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which aims, among other things, to create a good framework for business operations by providing sufficient quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable areas.
The park of friendship is also marked as the point of departure of a motorskating company in the centre, which has not yet received legal power.
The fall in the owner’s houses can be seen in garden shops.
The decrease in the number of owners, in particular in the group under 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of horticultural shops by tens of millions, when young consumers today reach their age in the "head sales" category of garden sales.
According to the Financial Times report, housing tenants use only 55 per cent of the money they spend on garden care for garden care.
The investigation also showed that more and more people live in very urbanly populated apartments without gardens. Furthermore, the size of the garden is reduced when the front yard is increasingly being covered into a parking space. These factors also threaten a garden area with an estimated value of approximately 5 billion pounds per year.
In London, the property of housing has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products are used for households for the smallest amount of money in the whole country.
According to HTA and the UK Garden Association (RHS), an increase in housing rental or a decrease in the size of the garden does not, however, mean that humans cannot grow plants.
RHS' leading garden designer Guy Barter says that 'for example, plants grown in transplantable breeding containers are particularly popular among the tenants because such farm containers may be included in their change if necessary'.
According to HTA's report, the years 1997-2005 were the period of the fall in the resale of the garden sector, as the property and property of housing increased from the end of the 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that trade will become worse this year thanks to better weather conditions, the weather in March and April last year has become worse than the weather in March and April.
Turkey is questioning the US US diplomat because of the spy report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on the country's most experienced US diplomat to report on a report on spying in Turkey by the Americans and the British.
According to Vice-President Bulent, the US Embassy administrator and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German Der Spiegel magazine and the newspaper The Intercept have written that the documents provided by the former National Security Agency (NSA) Edward Snowden, the former analyst, reveal that Turkey has been the main spy target of US and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish press, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan narrowed the meaning of the report, saying that all major countries have stabilised each other.
A previous report from the German Central Intelligence Service to Ankara had a more angry reaction to the Turkish Government.

Mallorcan Magaluf Police Commissioner accused of corrupting corruption.
The applicants presented evidence of the blackmail of the police and of the authorities of the City of Calvià at Mallorca's Public Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Calvià Police Commissioner on the Mallorcan holiday island has been arrested as a result of the corruption charges posed by the traffic and bar owners in the region of Magaluf, known as the wet party.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was placed in custody after several traffickers of Punta Ballenna street presented corruption charges against him. In the Punta Ballena street, most of the Magaluf bars and night clubs are located.
According to Mallorca Diario, a daily newspaper published on the network showed that the cases were filed by the police and the civil servants of Calvià for the blackmail by Mallorca against corruption at the Office of the Prosecutor General on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard arrested two other local police officers in connection with charges of corruption, and they're with Navarro on trial with the judge.
The newspaper ABC, which appears in the whole country, wrote about the impartiality of the angry authorities of night club owners, which made a significant contribution to their business.
"There is no more money in this case, no more money, but rather survival," one trafficker informed the Court of Justice.
You're not destroying our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magulf was in several countries on the headlines this summer when YouTube video was released online, where an 18-year-old British holidayman who had sex with 24 men during the so-called "pub crackl" period.
Since then, the authorities of the island have tried to control the wasted and uncontrollable use of the Maglufi holidayers by reducing the number of participants of the evil, alcoholic pub cracklie.
In addition, the Playhouse Night Club, where the oral video was filmed, was prescribed for a year to be closed, and for the owner of the night club and for Carnage, the organiser of the pub crackl, a fine of EUR 55,000 for Carnage was imposed jointly to pay the fines of EUR 55,000.
In the most popular tourist destination of Magaluf among young British tourists, the so-called balconing trend has also become popular, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents since people have jumped from a balcony from another or a balcony to a hotel swimming pool.
The children of the Israeli children will return to school after the Gaza war after the Gaza war.
Thousands of Israeli children returned to school on Monday after having spent the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and grenades bombed their communities in a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed when the region recovered from the battles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in rocket bombs in the communities of southern Israel, but the signs of the battles are still visible.
In the town of Ashdod, in the Passhosh day care centre in the south, workers removed the traces of shrapnels from walls and slides before the arrival of the children into the rocket after the attacking day home.
"We're a little scared, but we're also excited", says Ronit Bart, who lives in Koda-in kibbuts, Israeli communes, and works as an English teacher in the city's school.
Many children living in this area urgently need routines.
Bart's 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart thinks she's going to go back to school in a long time to feel "a little weird".
"We've had difficult times when we didn't leave home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbuts, near the Gaza border, to provide his support.
Before the start of the last week's ceasefire, thousands of people of communities living in the border area like Satai had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas away from Gaza in order to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, close to Gaza's front, are suspicious of the return to the Palestinian grenade killed by a four-year-old boy in the community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair ten families had not yet returned.
The children of these families are now placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a town near the Gaza border, which was the subject of a serious Palestinian demonstration.
He encouraged children to study hard and promised that "the training and safety of children will be ensured".
Israel and Hamas agree on the current ceasefire on the last Tuesday.
The war stopped immediately, but it did not bring a solution to many of the key issues, such as Hamas's demand for the removal of the island of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gaza's air and seas.
Israel wants to take away Hamas's weapons and restore the body of an Israelite soldier who died in two wars.
Egypt is expected to begin a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, over 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead persons, according to which at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had not been in evidence of this.
66 soldiers and six civilians died on the part of Israel, including Thai workers.
Hamas and other Gazan soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in Israeli cities mostly south of the country.
On behalf of the Israeli army, over 5,000 air strikes and other attacks were carried out.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people fled to cover more than 100 U.S. schools that had been transformed into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people were still protected and in the course of the fights, the school officials moved the school to start the previous week.
"I hope that the school will be opened soon and we will get back to school, just as other children in the world, and just as the Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, 13-year-old who lives in a school in Gaza, said.
According to the most commonly used meter, housing prices have risen most to seven years in the winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measured the prices of dwellings in the Australian capital city, rose by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP's data on Monday.
As a result, the increase in prices of summer, July and August amounted to 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same months after 2007 and beyond.
The annual increase in prices was 10.9 per cent, which is more than twice as much as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen steadily around the country.
According to RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Data shows that housing prices rose in Sydney by 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent last year.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are now the biggest ones; the average increase in prices is 5 to 6 per cent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year as a result of government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, springs in Australia will increase the number of dwellings in sales over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of auctioned dwellings, generally high sales pace and continued low interest rates, it is likely that the rise in prices of dwellings will continue in the next three months", says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has pulled the record brochures from Mänttä to Mäntä.
The new museum and art have been pulling record audiences this summer from Mänttä.
More than 70 000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and there has been, among other things, pop art classics from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
Mänttä’s art week again reported that on Monday he had performed a demonstration of his visit, while 14 500 visitors were visiting this summer.
These chapters have not been used to.
The people have come from doors and windows," says President Pauli Sivonen Serlachius from the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors throughout the year will come to Serlachius events this year to bring about a hundred thousand thousand people approaching.
In previous years, some 40 000 visitors have been present.
There are about 11,000 inhabitants in Mäntte-Vilpula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds me that the new museums are always opening up the phenomena.
"The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent," he says.
It is therefore hoped that the art period will continue to be extended to the end of the summer.
In the autumn art museum, new exhibitions will be opened.

Lenny Henry says, "My father never gave me a hug."
She never said she loved me. She never said she loved me.
Henry was born in 1958, United Britain's Midlands region of the United Kingdom, in Dudley, a family of immigrants from seven children in Jamaica.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19.
Henry is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, which is based partly on his father's visual discussion and which has been developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel set.
The audio track is a mixture of rheumatous and rapping in the upbet-ass.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
He's been in therapy several times since his mother died, and he's been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
My father was very difficult to read.
Never saw his face, just the voice said, stop talking.
Leave your sister alone.
Move it.
I'm looking at the crucifix.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a kid, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of the beer doctrine or the beauty of the crucifixion.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life he was the man in the corner with the smile at me, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal alloy in Dudley and thus got an idea of what his father's life must have been like, although the working conditions are now better than at that time.
They are a bit brighter today, but they are basically dark, smoke-free, Labyrinth-like depths, which cause flames, smoke and spring to come to mind.
My father used to take a bath and just lie in the tub, and soon he started singing to himself when he washed the fuse's dirt off of himself.
While walking around, I realized that he had worked for years to get us food for the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, the closeness provided by the parents was missing from Henry's childhood.
My father never gave me a hug and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother started getting sick a little before she died, we started to get together that we love each other.
Henry has Billie's daughter Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love that was missing from him as a child.
Do you have to keep saying, "I love you"?
Stop hugging me.
Dad, I'm 22 years old.
Dawn French.
Why aren't we friends?
She's a wonderful mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French who he was married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why would Dawn and I not be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to mother's death.
When I started suffering from excessive overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a full translation.
Then I started to exercise a lot, and I also had to start a rough diet to reduce symptoms.
It is very difficult –
And boring.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard perhaps describes his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the critics for his role as Otthello, he has sunk into making a theater.
The following was the Codyste Comedy and August Wilson's Fences ("Aids").
Making the theatre offers a different experience than the stimes and comedys that Henry has made throughout his busy career.
Henry started working in the field until he was 16 years old.
An ostrich saw him on stage making excuses and contacted the New Faces performance competition.
Henry's TV career began in the middle of the '70s. "For how long, I was the only black impersonator and comic book on TV," he says.
Henry learned how to work when he was doing his job.
I was supposed to grow up in public photos, learn how to make jokes from the sliders between 1975 and 1985, while living in the end and I was on television. It was a difficult time.
Lenny New Faces Competition in 1975.
Henry's manager had rights to play at The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people were present in black makeup, so Henry ended up in a comedy programme for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never been involved in it, but I don't regret it.
Although my position was strange and depraved, I was able to work at huge events and I learned how the audience was treated.
Yet the "britti-TV awarded, multi-annual favorite and light entertainment program" was, at the same time, "a brilliant parod of black people."
Henry worked in the second comedy series in the 1980s, where both a joke and a black British culture were admired.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the '90s Henry was known, among other things, for the character of cook Gareth Blacklock as a comedy series in the Chef series!
In the following decade, Henry spent on advertising, documents, television series and films, but after his LennyHenry.v series shown in 2008 in BBC, he said to himself, "What you're going to do next, Len – now it seems like you're just going around or going on sidewalks."
The following was the Radio 4 document series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part discussed Shakespeare.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
In fact, it wasn't properly taught for us at school, and I think it belonged to the white middle class, which uses socks and has money.
That's why Shakespeare's topic brought me fear.
All of the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Test.
Don't abandon the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
You know, you're dating people and you understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry said 20 volumes of Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It almost seemed like some part of me was missing earlier, and now it was put in place.
"That's what this is all about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your code, do a little research.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was done.
The play was finally a success.
It was probably expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Soon thereafter, Henry played the main role in the misdys comedy.
Suddenly, I was acting like a British national theater, and I couldn't quite believe it.
At one point, I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
Once there were technical problems in the play, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
"A little voice in my mind said to me, "You must do it 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the presentation would be extended as soon as the problem has been corrected.
I walked out of the scene, and some of me found relief.
It's not my duty,
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your role."
Henry "Fences" in the Duches Theatre at the Duches Theatre.
It was a challenge to learn how to play "Fences".
The weight is a good thing, it makes you more sustainable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign of gods; "This is what you have to do."
This Henry, of course, says with a voice in his voice.
I guess I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love exercise rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: small sense of humor constantly interrupts our conversation while changing his impression to another.
The arrest of the Stand-up Commission is a matter of will, since obtaining immediate thanks to the unknown public seems dangerous.
If you keep drinking it, it could lead to a dead end.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at Apollo Theatre when it feels like it, but in general it doesn't inspire me the way I used to be.
I'm gonna ask Henry if he's gonna leave for a new stand-up tour.
It brings me real joy to sit together with the director who will help me shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth, is it?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really funny.
The display keeps telling the story, and on that mission, it's for fun.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya shall draw up a register of officials to remove "hot workers".
Kenya has started to develop a biometric register of officials in order to remove "hospital workers" from government wage lists.
Workers who did not register in the next two weeks should no longer be paid, the government’s announcement was made.
The government has doubts that thousands are still paid after they have left their duties in office.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public sector after taking up office in 2013.
In the previous year, according to the audit carried out this year, at least one million dollars was spent in the month on the remuneration and other financial abuses of the "hot workers".
The government has doubts that wages will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official duties, BBC's Wanyama Chebusir reported from the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials should report to the register during the next few weeks at the identification centres in order to ensure that their data are stored in the biometric registration form, reported in the Government’s notice.
According to the information, anyone who fails to do this without a proper reason is removed from the pay lists.
"This measure significantly rationalises the public sector, since it defines how many people actually function in their duties, and it also cleans wage lists at both levels of the government. This is how to solve the problem of "favour workers", says Anne Waiguru, the official of the Ministry of Distribution and Design.
As a result of the 2015 financial year, the result may be EUR 25,5 million for deficits unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure developments in a tense economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the year-olds remain some 9.4 million deficits.
Possible ways of improving the efficiency of the services were to increase the scope and level of the services, to purchase services, to sell property and grants, and to increase tax and payment revenues.
The EUR 10 million reduction target for investment amounts to 8,5 million.
There is no excuse for the situation of the municipalities.
New obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient increase in tax revenues, increased unemployment and the reduction of 5 % of state contributions will further weaken prospects.
The objective of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The City Government agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must be translated into the strategy's objective," says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the Government.
The city government returned the proposals made to prepare for the board of directors.
The proposals of the Government are based on budget preparation in the Economic Seminar of the Board of Governors in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After a delegation seminar, the draft budget goes forward through a committee procedure to the City Government and the City Council.
Ten Turkish Turkish police officers arrested as suspect suspected of "run" against the government against the government.
All in all 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey as suspected of 'the anti-government plots', local media sources tell us about their plans.
The police did not immediately comment on the matter.
According to Hurriet Daily News, 14 senior police officers were arrested.
Some of the police were involved in last December's corruption investigations aimed at government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey as accused of organising a wide-ranging criminal society and following up on the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, acting as Prime Minister at that time, said that police operations were part of the Islamic Director-General of Fethulah Gullen against him and other people in power.
Not all children will go back to school in Ukraine, Ukraine. Not all children will return to school in Ukraine.
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is a traditionally significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time he told the waiting journalists that all schools have not opened up again, but he said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The first day of September of the ceremony was not spent in each school.
There is no peace in Ukraine as a whole.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at the school where Yatsenuk's daughter went to work, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The first day of school celebration is traditionally one of the children’s written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Texas Perry, Texas Perry says that the charming Twitite of the twitite was not allowed to be promised.
On Sunday evening, a abusive picture of the district attorney of the Democrats was sent from the Twitter account of Governor Rick Perry of Texas in consultation with the prosecutions of the abuse of power.
The Tweet was removed later, and it was followed by a new Tweet where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweet was sent unauthorized from my account.
"I don't approve of the Tweet and I've removed it," said the subsequent publication.
Perry's backup didn't respond immediately to the requests for clarification.
Although the Tweets were sent from Perry's confirmed Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first twitt contained a disgusting picture of Travis's district lawyer, Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to a wheel-driving campaign in April 2013.
Perry stopped Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a large jury meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused. Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
Tweet's title was, "I don't always drive drunk, with three times the maximum percentages allowed... but when that happens, I'm gonna blame Governor Perry for pointing his finger."
I'm the very humanist democracy in Texas.
The Chamber Office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antithio, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry has said that he was innocent and has called the accusations a political run.
His competent judicial officer has asked the judge to object to the accusations and said that the law on which the governor who was most in charge of Texas is unclear against the Constitution, hidden against the Constitution, is unclear.
Perry cut down $7.5 million of state aid to a public integrity unit operating in Travis County and handling public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision was given a formal complaint from the follow-up team to the left on the matter.
Perry's confirmed Twitter accounts are regularly updated – and sometimes also famously.
After reaching the fifth place at Iowa's election meeting during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to stop playing the game by publishing on Twitter a picture of himself flying in the lake with the text "Here comes from, South Carolina!".
Berkeley says that the housing market is "normal" again.
One of London's main developers has warned us that the housing market in South-East England has "has returned" to a normal level of activity.
Capital London's housing has been subject to massive demand and sharp price increases while being afraid of a wide spread of credit bubbles, which led the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
On Monday, the founder and President Tony Pidgley of the high-level builder of Berkeley said that "from the beginning of the marketing year, the market and the number of shops have returned to normal since 2013" and added that this has enabled "a stable operating environment".
During the recession, the London housing market went well with foreign investors seeking to reach a large number of capitals.
According to land register data, housing prices in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices for the private, affordable and student buildings at Berkeley rose by around the fifth year, reaching a 423 000 pound increase by the end of April.
However, the strengthened pound has been making London a less attractive object in recent months - part of the interest has also been influenced by the new real estate tax laws and political rhetoric of the possible "kartano tax" before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that April's mortgage loan report, which reported more stringent loan orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth in both the sales volume and prices of real estate in the second half of the year.
The recent data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the number of approved loans decreased in July, indicating a cooling housing market.
The real estate operator Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast for the prices of real estate in London, according to which prices fall by three per cent, since the index of prices of housing owners has already started to decrease.
The number of transactions made in London's most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has risen in a quarter year ago, the real estate broker WA Ellis says.
However, domestic demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which raised income from sold real estate to more than 2.2 billion euros.
Pydgley added that "the demand for the right product in the best places has remained stable, so sales have remained lively".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3 742 new homes in the year before April, which is almost a third more than at the time of the peak since the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual gains calculated before taxes increased by 40 per cent year-on-year, i.e. by 380 million pounds, and turnover grew by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion euros.
Pidgley told us on Monday before the Annual General Meeting that Berkeley's annual earnings correspond to the current market expectations of the market.
Analysts agree that the annual pre-tax profit is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's share sold evenly at the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon at a price of 23,96 pounds.
hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's downward images into the network.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards Awards event.
A hacker who claims to be holding a hundred different photos leaked into the web by Oscar's actor Jennifer Lawrence.
The Vice-President confirmed that the pictures were genuine and condemned the hacker "insolently insulting privacy".
The authorities have been contacted, and all those who publish Jennifer Lawrence's stolen pictures will be subject to prosecution.
The images that were originally published on the 4chan image page were apparently in the wrong hands because of the weakness of Apple iCloud's discount system. The reason for the 100 other hacking targets is that there are ten other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winston and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed, who told me.
It is not known how much of the images are genuine, but Scott Pilgrim versus the World Star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"To those who look at the pictures that were taken by me and my husband in privacy years ago: I hope you'll have a good mind", the Winston Twinits.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victorious" series, however, denied the authenticity of the images and Twi said that "the images of the so-called nuisance of me are a lie that you don't understand."
Let me finish this right at the start.
Mr BuzzFéden announced late Sunday that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the pictures about the stars.
Just the new novel that we are about to show thanks to Howard Jacobson for the new novel about love and the J-book about love and J-book.
They slipped, it pictured the best thing that happened, gradually disintegrating each other like a cardboard box that was left out of the rain.
Only then he heard from a woman that was too serious, too painful, intensive, disconnected, and perhaps also a little bit pecky.
That's when he threw his hand at me.
He knew the whole thing.
Yes, he was a sniper like a pig.
The last victim of his pin had been an initial relationship which, however, had been promising; it had appeared that this relationship could have made his lonely boredom easier and could have brought his life to even something of content.
Ailin Solomons had unsatisfied hair and he was delicately tenderly gentle with a cheerful heart, from the northern village, which was worse and further away than Port Reuben.
He had come south with an older traveling partner, whom Kevern thought was his aunt, who had inherited a house that was in a wet but paradise valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately the Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the ethanols had left their tails in the window, keeping the whole place their own, in the garden of large-scale pottery, which reminded me of giant potheads.
The cabin was like the rain of children, at the same time threatening and magical, garden full of secrets.
Written by the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is a candidate for the Booker Literature Prize in 2014.
Next week, the candidates will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
Kevern had been sitting in the hands of Alilin with a broken steel chair in the middle of a long hay, enjoying a surprising warm spring afternoon, both of which I heard a disconcerting reception, through which the whole country heard entertaining music and calming news when Aliin's crucified, sun-broken feet brought to his mind a song that had long since sang a forgotten black performer, and which his father had often listened to the balconies downstairs.
Your leg's too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played at the reception site.
They were not banned – absolutely nothing was prohibited – they were not only called anymore.
They wanted to leave them to sleep, just like the word itself unhulled.
The public opinion did what the laws and the proclamation had not achieved: just as people chose to read the heroes’ memories, cookbooks and novels, for music they prefer the bandades.
As a matter of fact, Kevern started to pick up an imaginary piano and sing Serenadia for the big legs of Ailin with a poor compilation voice.
I didn't understand.
"It was a jazz pianist Fats Waller's famous song," Kevern told him, and he naturally raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
So his father had always done before the "j" letter had escaped from his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and Dad when he was little.
His father told me that he played the same game with his own father.
If you let a word start with J out of your mouth, and you didn't forget to raise two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game then, and it wasn't even now.
He knew it was expected for him, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what jazz is about.
I've never heard anything like that before.
Jazza was not specifically declared to be banned either, but it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer fashioned.
There was only room for a single word in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
Well, that's the same thing happened to the novelty.
Its inexplicability made people nervous.
Jazz was the cleverness of music.
Although Kevern hadn't heard Sammy Davis Junior by the age of 10, jazz music had become familiar to him through his father's half-told CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Aliin that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Alimann, it was likely that he could not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
There is no need for laws or for coercion.
The well-known society meant that each of its parts was accepted with the most grateful – most grateful – that they had been saved by happy trade – the principle that each group did things that were natural for it.
Based on their temperature and physical characteristics, people with afro-Caribbean tribes are best suited to entertain and sports, so they sang and run.
Originally, those from the Indian continent were like naturally talented with electrical devices, so their mission was to ensure that each family had a functional phone that was used to handle matters.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke the plates.
When those who were from the Persian Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled with great fear that they would be accused of the flames rushing and fear that the flames would catch them next, they opened up restaurants that served the Labneh justice court and burned water barrels, and their lives would continue their eyes on the ground with created and boring depression.
Each one shall act according to his gifts.
All I had heard of was the pools, and he was hard to understand how Kevern's words that were just singing could never be dressed as music.
Through the music, I was shown love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except for those with big legs, maybe.
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created the safety of illusions.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of giant cranberry leaves.
Still, I didn't understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He was gonna say the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to raise two fingers on his lips with Alimann.
I thought she was weird now.
"It was fun for Dad," he said instead.
I mean, I was sitting on her head with unbelievable faith, and her hair covered up with Kevern's vision.
Nothing to see around the world except the huge, shadow of the hairboard of Aliden.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," he said, "but it didn't sound like convincing."
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
I thought I was really confused.
Are my legs that big?
He looked again.
Well, your feet aren't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you" but it was too early for it.
"You're attractive to me because of your thick ankles," he tried to fix the situation.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This was no help.
She wanted it to sound like fun.
Often, when he wanted to be funny, the effect was quite different, because from him, like his father, the convincing charm in which the cruelty of a joke could be ruled over by him.
Maybe his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite his gentle eyes.
Ailin Solomons reddished and rose from the terrace and poured down the receiver and sprained the wine which they had just had been drinking.
The wine had only been made from the back of his back, so he couldn't use it as the cause of the collision.
In a nervous state, he seemed to starve like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your fat head is what makes me very fond of you," he said...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Alimann, for his own, unnecessary cruel words, and for the fear that appeared in his eyes in the moment that Alilin decided to stand up against him.
Did I think she'd hit him?
He had never told Kevern about his life in the north of the island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that basically it was like life here too.
It's the same vast, hygrious sea that's being humiliated against them.
The same mixed men, though even more pale and paleer than their smuggler and disintelligent parents, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to hit every woman who would dare to resist or torture them.
Fat head?
He'd still see a thick fist if it weren't careful.
Inject first – the kiss had become the most common word describing the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to pumping the pumping unmarked loveballs – first ingest and then attack.
He felt that it was too much, too, because already it was hostile to impersonating in itself.
I've been told by the body language of Aleini Solomons that she should leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace like an old man.
Alilin also felt surprised, but she was surprised by the depth of the sorrow of Kavern.
This wasn't the end of the world.
Hedin barely knew each other.
I was watching him go — just as his traveling partner watched him go out the upstairs window — a man who himself was the cause of his heavy life.
Adam's going out of the garden, he's thinking about it.
He felt sorry for the Everin and the men generally, even though some of them had lifted up their hands against him to attack him.
Clearly a man who turned his back, a curfew, a shame, a man who had lost all hope of fighting — why did he feel that this vision was so familiar to him, even though he did not remember that he had seen it once before this moment?
When I was alone again, I was alone, and she looked at her legs.
A few years before the event described just before, an intelligent and zealous 32-year-old researcher, Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a private institution measuring the General Mind at Ofnow, did a brief study of the continuation of small and medium-sized violence in the areas of violence in which the decline, or the subsequent cessation, was likely to take into account the money and energy used for its cracking.
"There has already been a lot of progress, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "that can be reduced to thousands of years of struggle and most often the natural aggression of the anointed people, especially in the abandoned and remote hills where, in spite of the churches beyond the shrines, human feats are rarely known for time.
However, some things may not be completely erased.
The higher the tower, the lower the mood it creates.
In the face of sentimental Ballads, the people cries stories about the anointed, swears on the name of the virtues of marriage and family life, but at the same time, the old-fashioned cruelty keeps the land communities and urban cohabiting areas in their eyes, and there is evidence of a new kind of, more indiscriminate dispute in homes, workplaces, streets and even playgrounds.
"You have to regret the tendency to dramatize", his director commented after reading the entire report.
I'd suggest you read less novels.
First Nussbaum shot his eyes on the ground.
And I have to ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
First of all, he appealed to his right not to answer any personal questions.
A feminist?
Another silence.
"I'm not asking," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I oppose atheism, lesbian sex and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of an unprecedented society.
Although a certain degree of hypersensitivity is, in itself, totally acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, to what you have just presented to me.
Obviously, you have something against the church — and what you call cruelty or evil spirit — that others normally call natural energy and physical power.
As if it had happened yesterday, if it happened at all, it destroys the fundamental vital vitality of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum looked around about Rabinowitz talking.
Behind the head of Rabinwitz, the flaming pink LED light announced the instructions Ofnow had distributed to the country in the fourth or longer of the previous century.
Smile with your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to the pools, go to your music, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, don't agree, excuse me.
Talking is better than silence and singing the word is better than writing, but nothing wins love.
"I understand well what you want to say", Esme Nussbaum replied silently when it was certain that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we imagine ourselves being.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we repeat the same mistakes that originally led to SIHEN, HOW TO BE DESIGNED, IF IT WAS A BEST.
This time, though, we are not leaking our hatred and lack of confidence in others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "recording as "you're making mistakes" about what our grandparents may have done or not.
You will also go too far as you say that they poured out their 'rain and mistrust' to others.'
If you are in a position like yourself, you should not remind yourself that when it comes to understanding the past, or defending the present, we do not talk about us or 'they'.
There was no "we" or "others".
It was chaos time, that's all we know about it.
"If we are completely honest in that chaos," Esme was afraid to continue, "No group of societies could say that he behaved well.
I don't blame anyone.
What they did, what they did, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to talk about it more - we agree on that.
And just as it is unnecessary to split accusations, there is no need to make adjustments, whether justified or not, and even if there is some way to do so.
But for what the past exists, if not learned from it--
The past exists so that we can forget about it.
If I can add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and indicated that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day he came to work in the normal way, he was hit by a biker on the sidewalk who was described as "painted and furious" by the passersman.
Events happen.
Leslie's army will deny that it was planned to attack; the Prime Minister will remain in South Africa.
Leslie's military officials have refused to set up an attack on the government and said that they were working against a police officer suspected to try and arm the political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had planted his official apartment and had taken over government buildings in the capital city of Maserus.
The head of state went to South Africa with his family after telling him that he had been killed.
Major General Ntle Ntoi denied the attack and said that the army responded to this threat from "political fanatics." The police have been told that he was trying to arm the fanatics.
"Lesotho's military forces took action after having received several intelligence reports that some police officers are trying to armed young party fanatics when they were ready to cause problems" he told the Voice of America's News Office.
According to the President-in-Office of the Government of South Africa, Clayson Monyela, the military activities seemed to be a revolutionary undertaking.
"Although no party has claimed to have ruled over the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces appear to be signs of a corresponding revolution", he says.
According to Leslie's army officials, soldiers are returning to their camps on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that action is being taken because he has been trying to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Leslie since June, when Thabane interrupted parliamentary sessions due to differences between the large coalition government.
He thus denies the power of the government to decline, even if it is alleged otherwise, to the contrary.
magazine: Microsoft will set up a data centre for U New Land: Microsoft will set up a data centre for the U New Land.
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data center for the Uusimaa site where the company will not be able to specify its location.
In the communication to Microsoft's media, the company notes that it does not indicate the location of all its data centers for safety reasons.
The Centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network according to Microsoft.
For Microsoft, it is a investment of hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the public place, Oulu or Kajan had previously been referred to as the place of the centre.
Microsoft completely ceases its office at Oulu, which brings about 500 people to work.
In all cases Microsoft has announced that it is up to a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft’s Communication Director Camilla Lindfors says to STT that the company does not comment on how much staff the new data center employs.
The creation of the Data Centre for New Zealand was the subject of a trade magazine on Monday.
He's accused of being accused of a girl driving a girl over a girl in traffic lights on the traffic lights.
A 78-year-old man is charged with driving a three-year-old girl on a traffic light in Fifth.
Gordon Stewart is accused of riding a girl on a crossover in the Pistelween East Neuki.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car with caution and caused injury to the girl.
Stewart, 78 from the Minister, denied the charges during the sitting of Sheriff Dundeen.
The Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos.
If you want to take pictures or video under water, you will have to choose a number of different device options.
The most advantageous option is a watertight, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both pay about $300.
I actually took these pictures at a family party using a number of different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a number of rules that should be followed.
Check your equipment twice every time.
Even if you had a watertight camera, make sure that the battery and other parts of the camera are closed in a watertight manner.
In addition, set the camera description settings to match the images or video you take.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a regulation to optimize the description conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into water, make sure how deep your device can take you.
Some cameras last only for 5 feet, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
See both common and water-based models in our shopping guide and reviews of the digital cameras.
Take several pictures – many of them fail in some way.
The compact cameras have a LCD display that allows you to combine the image, whereas the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you had a LCD, it's hard to see under water, and mixing a picture can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera lets you have a grip, which means taking multiple images at a time with different settings, use this feature.
Stay close to the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface as you describe the pool, lake or sea.
This will give you more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you can see.
Try to get closer to the illustrative object.
This is an important advice when describing land, but even more important under water because the light conditions are low.
It is very important when an action camera is used: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the monitor should be close to the object to fill the entire image frame.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge.
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to elect candidates for elections in 2017, despite the growing state of concern for democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests of Hong Kong's business block, starting with activists, to plan and implement demonstrations only hours after the publication of the decision.
The decision of the People's Party of China gives in practice the Communists the power to eliminate all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
"This was supposed to be, but it's still inexplicable," says the president of the Democratic Party, legislative director Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've been lying to the Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are dealing with the self-government.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Committee of the People's Party of China, defended the Chinese regime, saying that the general stand-up to the Hong Kong Director in the complaint would be too "out of chaos".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed Hong Kong China to Beijing, Beijing promised the residents of the region that it would be able to choose its own leader from 2017 onwards.
According to Chinese leaders, the Sunday decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the electoral committee, which is managed from Beijing.
Under the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" are accepted.
During the summer before the decision, some of the biggest and most remarkable protests in Hong Kong were held in the region for years.
Behind the democratic campaign was largely the Occuppy Central With Love and Peace, whose organisers have threatened to block the operation of the business block if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong genuine universal voting rights.
On Sunday night, only one hour after the publication of the decision, hundreds of Occuppy Central's supporters met in the rain before the main government buildings in Hong Kong.
In a demonstration, the operators of the movement announced that the movement would move into a new era of civil disobedience and would bring about protests in the coming weeks.
However, they obviously did not tell details, fear that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
When published online, organisers said that the movement " considers the Occuppy Central trick as the last tool to be introduced only if there is no hope of dialogue and there is no other way of doing so".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance for dialogue has been lost and that the power of the centre will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday, security measures were tight near the government's main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, a lack of peace is a way for many people to feel that they are slowly losing control of their power.
The wave of those arriving on the continent has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, will disappear under the increasing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong's living conditions — the business world.
"The process they are talking about can lead to major economic losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it takes," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long appreciated the movement.
We don't want to make sure Hong Kong is falling off our clothes.
Such an image would be bad for investment.
In the media of the PRC, stories have also been presented that Hong Kong democratic activists are co-directors of the Lithuanian Western powers of revolution.
This summer, the activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, involving 780 000 people – over one fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest demonstrations in favour of democracy in the region.
American prom tradition attacks UK universities: new students have private budgets for new students.
We are eager to meet our demand by setting up the UK's first class travel form for today's students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other means of transport, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure that the maximum amount of memory is reached at the university.
Stewart said there's also a safety aspect for the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today's students with as simple as possible and high-quality transport to the university as possible.
According to the company, reservations have not yet been made since the service has just been set up, but added that "students will start making orders over the next few weeks".
The company believes that there is demand for the service, although most students pay $9 000 per year.
Today's students are very different from those who started their studies 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it's more important than ever to create an ancient first impression, and VIF is just the right way to do it.
However, the National Association criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the College of Higher Education, "this service plan seems to be really far from the lives of the student body."
Many of the starters of their studies in this month start to start with shocking the level of cost of living when the financial support provided in the form of loans and grants has remained after the peak increase in basic costs, and only one can begin to think about where thousands could be used as simple as the fact that the campus has arrived.

Corball: Fan incentive nearly too much: Sasu Salin was fainted into the field.
The basketball Sasu Salin was today a body-leaving of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget the depth of his U.S. match and set aside the blood pressure of Ukraine's second half of its own solution.
But Sal moved all the glory to the susifans, and he did it in a way like:
I was going to go out there at the end of the field, and that encouragement was so great.
In the eye, it was a cloud, it was nothing.
That noise and the White Sea were almost too much for me.
The power moments of the gym contained nine surfaces in a fast pace, ball abuses, discs and a temmelly everywhere.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into a flash mode like that, and it all worked out.
It's just going to be something, some other time, in a really crazy, important place, Sasu was glowing.
It's my role.
Do all that stuff.
I'm glad to see that the rest of you got caught up in the run.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team's vigor and spirit creatures, so no wonder that his example brought the entire team to a flight which was a big and hard-core Ukraine for five too many times.
After a 32-year break in the Finnish MM-games: The former Members remembered the gross judge.
Heikki Montonen, the chief coach of Finland, was in the MM tournament of Argentina in 1982.
It's been 32 years since the Finnish men's volleyball team played last time in the World Cup tournament.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish composer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finnish second coach and the current player agent Jouni Parkkali as a universal player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was in the beginning a hot fight against France.
"In the game of the solution ball, the judge was rude," remembered Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already set themselves in the back.
All of a sudden, the game was stopped.
We lost it in 2-3, and then the horns went crazy more than that," said Parkkali.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montosen in command and was finally placed on 17th.
Finland is now among the world's elections when Poland's MM tournament arrives at speed this Saturday.
Many things have changed radically in international balloons over the last 32 years.
Players' power values are approximately the same as before, but the quality and skill are now more than ever.
The average length of players has also increased.
The game is even faster", thinking about Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
Finland’s gambling material has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to continue to make it from the beginning.
Then you can get tight," says Kosonen.
That's why we're here.
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were hit in a victory match against Tunisia.
The current player, Jouni Parkkali, was a universal player in the MM tournament.

Finnish civil servants saved Cita from mountain Cita in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his dogs were in trouble on Thursday nights, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered a brave offer of help.
During the weekend Mikkelsen was looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank his donors for one more time.
Mikkelen announced in the public Facebook update that the Cita dog that was with him on Thursday's mountains hurt his pocket.
The injured dog was no longer able to walk in a steep land.
I tried to carry it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried several times to attract and draw it a bit further, but its legs did not just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelen, the help did not wake up from the police, from the nearby hotel, from the passersby.
In the dark of last night, the situation has already begun to appear to be a threat.
Fortunately, there were two walkers who were ready to help: the Baptist Antti Soiini and his father, Tuoma.
Men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp when they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in relation to the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini tells me about the message he sent to Evening Sanome.
Soon there also happened to be a German man who had a traveler with him.
A few of the people who were injured had been brought to Pattä's.
The Germanman came to us for a moment after we had thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog in his arms at a moment off the front, Soini says.
DESCRIPTION: Judge Soni
The dog was picked up with a X-ray.
According to Soin, the execution was not physically heavy, but the load on the difficult ground slowed down.
In about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happily reached down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook so that he could thank them again.
The calls answered him on Sunday, but the Germanman is apparently still uncharted.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen's happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we might not have come back.
I'd like to find these people because I feel like I'm not thanking them enough.
I'm sure they don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am eternally grateful to them.
On Monday the night before Monday, the Sunis were already on their way home.
They had heard from the Mikkelsens: - Cita says she's feeling better now.

A genetic abnormality is often diagnosed wrongly wrongly.
For years, a British woman was afraid to die because of a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth was that he had only a few years of life left since he had a diagnosis of another disease.
He actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves of the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK Organisation, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases because they are known so little.
It is estimated that about 23,000 people in Britain are suffering from CMT diseases that are causing symptoms of motorism, such as muscle weakness, difficult walking, and tightness of the toes.
The disease may also cause unconsciousness or pain, and it is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was ill with Friedreich ataxia (FA) with a very bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would be in a wheelchair before he was 18 and he would die before he was 30 years old.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two children says: "When I was a child, I knew that I couldn't do the same things as anyone else.
I fell every day, and I took longer than anyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other kids, and I was tempted at school because I walked and ran differently from other kids.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was subjected to several surgerys on his shoulder to perform his legs. In the event of surgery, he looked quickly at his research papers, which said he was suffering from the FA disease.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, when I went home, I went home with a detailed record of the disease in the library, and I wrote to the FAQ Society," he says.
When I found out about them, I was shocked and panicous.
I thought I'd end up in a wheelchair by the age of 18 and die before I was 25 and I would almost lose my entire performance.
I went through this for myself, and I designed my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17 he said that his walk was not as bad as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just saw me and said, "girl, honey, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous than a disease.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
"When they explained to me what CMT disease is, I thought I was delayed," he says.
Charity CMT UK - organises the CMT month to pay attention to illness.

The Hull washed the attack on Hernandez's company's record sum sum of the record of Hernandez's company.
The Chosen Society Hull invested a record sum of the company in the acquisition of Abel Herndez, a country team member from Uruguay.
Hernandez will exchange Hull with an Italian congregation from Palermo of 9,5 million pounds, i.e. about EUR 12 million.
It's a three-year contract.
Hernandez hit 14 goals last season when Palermo won Serie B and rose to Italy's main show.
In the Uruguay country team, he's made seven goals in 14 matches.
In the last summer's World Cup tournament, Hernandez came in two matches from the switch to the field.

The Russian space test failed - the geos sent off to sex travel died.
The five little guys sent up to Russian space are dead, reports the Russian Federation Space Agency Roscosmos's information.
The dogs traveled over a month and a half with the Foton-M4 satellite.
Satellite returned to the country on Monday morning at the Finnish time.
The purpose of the test was to study the reproductive capacity and use of ticks in the weightless state.
One male breed and four females participated in the test.
Although the test sounds special, it was meant to be serious.
For example, there is little knowledge of the effects of pressure on the development of hockey eggs, for example.
Through the effects of the genes, it is possible to anticipate the impact of unweighting on human beings in this state of longer duration, as illustrated by New Statesman in July.
According to Roscosmos, the time of death and cause of death or death are being investigated.
According to Interfax, the passengers identified as "sex-genders" were frozen.
Surprise is also reported by the fact that fruit grapes, which were transported along the same trip to Photon-M4, survived the journey, also suffered post-growth.

A 22-year-old man is suspected to have served as a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities notified the matter on Sunday.
The authorities were able to track down a man after he was attracted by money to a 16-year-old girl leaving Syria.
The girl was supposed to fly to Turkey and cross the Syrian border from there.
The airline did not believe the girl explained that she was going to visit her grandmother in Istanbul, but called the authorities.
The authorities contacted a girl's father who was completely unaware of her daughter's intentions and told the authorities that the family had no family in Turkey.
According to the authorities, he is from Chechnya, but he lives in France now.
The French intelligence officers had been following the man's actions earlier.
In France, the French authorities have been concerned that the radicalised young people attracted to Iraq or Syrian wars also constitute a security risk for France.
The authorities estimate that some 800 French citizens or French nationals have been travelling to, returned to, or are currently planning to leave Syria during the last conflict.
Copenhagen: We have a good chance to win.
The wishes of the basketball team for the destination are in the game when Finland is meeting today at the second match of the World Cup in Ukraine.
If the opening ceremony was expected for the United States, Ukraine will once again be one of the countries where Finland should take the necessary profits at its destination.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I believe we have a good chance of winning, Petter Koponen's forward.
Ukraine hit the Dominican Republic 72-62 on Saturday at its first match in the competitions.
The team is trained by NBA-veteran Mike Fratello, whose command Ukraine plays an aggressive basketball.
Ukraine's key player is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a 100-meter world champion three years from now.
Jeter threw 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Poo Jeter's quick guy, but yes, we've been played against them before, and we need to get our standard defense right, Koponen said.
Hännu Mötölä promised that Finland would play better than in its last defeat to the United States.
We need to find our own strengths again.
I can guarantee you that there will be a normal wolf on the field, Mötölä said.
According to Hollywood stars, the alleged skins spread online, some are confirmed to be genuine.
There are a number of images on the Internet that are alleged to be known for the public.
Amongst other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been victims of the "pox-vaccinated" campaign.
The TMZ page has published an angry comment by Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a nasty privacy insult.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (in the Internet) Jennifer Lawrence's stolen photos will be charged with a charge, a threat to representatives.
According toTMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winston has confirmed that images that spread to her are real.
He had taken these pictures years ago with his husband.
When I know those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible trouble was seen for this.
I have a sympathy for anyone who was victimized by hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, actor Victoria Justice says pictures of his own name are faked.
There are also genuine or counterfeit discharge images on the move from at least Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovski and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka painter criticised his own: "You don't work hard enough to get out of here."
The football club FC Honka is currently in the final position of the Veikkasuing League.
Maalivaht Walter Five comments after the VPS match on Sunday reflect a very confused current situation of the company.
I haven't had a goal coach in four months.
But everything has to be adjusted," said Viittala after a fight that ended in 1-2.
Honka made a lot of military mistakes in the fight, especially during the first half of the day.
The painter Viitala was not pleased with the bad defence games.
Player traffic in Honga has been busy this summer, and for that reason the defenders in front of Hehta have changed their paces.
As a player, too, many young players have had opportunities that they may not even deserve.
"There's not enough work to get out of here sometimes," said Viitala, without having to name any single player.
Ms Shefki Kuqi, head coach of Honga, was somewhat in agreement with Mr Viita.
"I told some players after the game that if you come to practice and play games to have fun and you think you're a betting player, and you don't have to work, you're probably in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given many young people time to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
Kuqi also recalled, however, that players cannot expect immediate success when players continue to change their gamemates.
This period has not been twice in the same composition.
In particular, at the front of the defense, people have changed.
That's the biggest reason why we're here", Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo after the VPS killing, in line with the second most recent TPS.
There are still seven rounds left, so the espoolers still have time to avoid falling to One.
I've never knocked a team before, and I'm not going to fall now.
We're certainly not going to fall off this show," the goalkeeper at the White War threat.
Lars von Trier making a TV series after decades of break after a decade of break.
The film director Lars von Trier is planning to return to the television series.
The Danish director prepares the TV series called The House That Jack Build.
The series project told me about Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier's films, today at the Venice Film Festival on Monday night.
According to Zentropa’s publication, the series descriptions should start in 2016.
Trier will be told about the scripting work on a set of pages from this autumn.
The series is in English.
The secret project is also reported in the communication by Trier’s long-term partner, a producer known for his hard sales talks, Peter Aalbæk Jensen.
According to him, the similar series "I've never seen and never come to see" is similar.
"Keep your breath," Aalbæk Jensen says in the bulletin.
Lars von Trier, 58, has, in recent years, been known for its media performances and films such as Antichrist and Nymhomaniac.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom series into television.
01.09.2014 15:20 The chain of commerce Lidl seems to have got Finnishs on its side, at least if there is faith in the results.
The net sales of the group Lidl, which runs Finland’s activities, continued to increase during the financial year which ended in late February.
The company also increased its output.
Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 79,6 million, compared with EUR 56,4 million a year earlier.
Net sales increased from EUR 960 million to EUR 1.2 billion.
The growth was 25 per cent.
The company that increased its market share also improved its operating income from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The percentage of operating profit became 7.1%.
The financial year of German-owned Lidl will last from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company reports that it has paid taxes to Finland for the financial year ended in February at EUR 13.7 million.
The company that has constantly expanded its chain of stores has announced that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl stores in Finland and employs more than 4 000 employees.
The first stores were opened in 2002.
For Ice Bucket, the participant in the Ice Bucket season, a le le lea on his pigs.
British Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when water was poured on him that he damaged his face's bones.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman has been taken to medical care after her screaming at Ice Bucket when she's done so hard that her jaw went off her ass.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when water was poured on top of him that he damaged the structure of his face.
"The water was so cold that I just screamed, but when I was screaming, I felt my chin getting frozen," he tells The Mirror magazine.
The ice water is poured over 20 years of age.
Isabelle Roberts moments before the accident.
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to thank them for their first aid.
The 20-year-old British who took part in the super-sponsive challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the jaw was returned to the scene.
A video game has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Faced with wolves (including): How can an increase in fan volume explain how?
It was a great guy today.
So said basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played at the EM final tournament against France in the Athenian Marouss Ballball hall.
I didn't overdo it to Pekone.
I remember the game when you were there.
So were the about 100 Finns who cried for 20 000 viewers, otherwise the noise of an empty hall.
What would Pehkonen have said 19 years after the World-Swives game in the World Games in the World Games, after the Finnish-Ukrainian match in the MM Games?
In Bilbao, hundreds of Finnish fans have 20 times the troops.
The EM-games 1995 were Finnish basketball hunting hours.
The men took their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian scratch fight in Helsinki Sports House.
The victory opened the doors for Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
Happy young people, like Hanno Mötölä.
Chief Coach Henrik Dettmann raised Mötölö's rock line to the final tournament team.
The solution that many people disagreed with.
Now you can say that Dettmann was very smart, even though everything didn't work out according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived deep into the ground.
In the Athens competitions, Finns were reportedly there for a total of over 100 people.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coach and a few fans.
Bilbao also has journalists, relatives and trainers, but there are fans there too.
And there's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown into inexplicable proportions.
I'm sure no one can tell the exact number of Finnish tourists.
The estimates have moved between 7 500-10 000 and 10 000.
Whatever the number is in there, it's an totally incomprehensible amount.
Here's the explanation for sports sociology.
In the global economy, companies move across borders across the world.
There is still an opportunity for sport to look at how we are going internationally.
As mobility increases, we can see how our girls and boys succeed in the world, says Professor Hannu Itonen of mobility education.
There are certainly Finns in both Spain and in the World Championships of the balloon in Poland who apply for life.
Common experience.
But it doesn't explain everything.
In sports itself, there must be force of gravity.
I'm sorry to lift sport into a popular culture.
It is a lower threshold to go to sports than to Berlin to watch the art of Berlin.
However, without success, masses cannot be fired.
Let's go back to 1995.
At that time, Chief Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and the players to throw themselves into top-sports professionally.
It took almost ten years for that to happen.
Then the direction changed and the national team activity was set on foot.
The flight crew made the same move a little earlier.
Now they both enjoy the fruit of their work.
As Itken says, both species have managed to produce their top sports, where the sacred Trinity operates: sports-media sponsors.
The audience will also be interested.
And the media has taught me what such a carnal support is like, Itkonnen reminds me of.
Can football species move this massive interest into the home series as well?
On average, basketball and volleyball are played for hundreds or just over a thousand viewers.
It is a good question for aging, and it does not necessarily give an answer that would promise very good for the species.
One of the schools believes that the interest in moving forward is an interest.
The other is the one who doesn't want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for an experience trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking domestic series are not often interested.
It is a challenge for the people who follow it in the midst of the dust.
The site at Bottektan confirmed - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake shore of Lake Lake Lakes - almost 1.5 hectares from the coast of Lake Lake Bothtnak - near 1.5 ha from the coast of Lake Lake Lake.
Nastola is awarded the model driver Valtter Bottsän on the beach plot.
At its meeting on Monday, the Government adopted unanimously the donation of a plot of 1.4 hectares at its meeting.
In the future, there will be a further increase in the area of leisure housing.
There has been a follow-up to Botaks' success since this marketing period.
He's being treated as a good ambassador to market the Gulf, the Gulf Region, and Nastala.
The gift counter is located in Koiskala, on the shores of Kärkjärvi.
It has become owned by the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the area, of which the municipality will decommission at the expense of six by the end of this year.

Ralph Lauren's smart-ass testers are field ball players, but also the top-level amateur Marcus Giro likes that.
According to him, the shirt will help him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
Silver sensors are woven into their nylons, the information is transmitted to the cell in the shirt and still on the smartphone or tablet computer.
Antlers measure heart rate, breathing rhythms, stress and steps.

The fashion machine has not told you exactly what time to start selling the shirt, nor even suggested it at the price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only company that invests intelligence.
Athos, California, has brought in smart shirts and smarts.
They measure heart rate, breathing and muscle work.

Smart way to save books in textbooks.
The cost of college books in America is over $1,000 for a number of students, so soon the start of the second year of study by Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of studies, would save the cost of his/her wise way of doing things.
He developed a system in which students of later annual courses quote their books against the nominal remuneration of their books instead of selling the books right away.
"My math book would normally have paid $180; I paid $10 for it for the whole season and I paid you a sandwich," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies at Covent College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder tells me that his book of the last semester normally cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on it.
According to the Board of Directors, the average student spends over $1 200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a wide range of ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
More and more students rent textbooks, when they can use the book throughout the academic period and pay clearly less than the students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc, a company with more than 250 campus book stores, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistical data on the sector reveal that about a quarter of the books of the university bookshops last spring were book books," says Trevor Meyer, President of the Neebo company.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are obtained from book stores in campuses.
The simplest ways to save money is to save money.
Retail trade
In online shops, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would pay in the bookstore of the campus.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is nearly $290, but the book of the special books store, Chegg.com, is available at $23.99.99.
Buy as used.
The books used are a good option if the reader does not interfere with other notes and past appearances.
For example, the 'Calculus' book can be used from the Chegg.com online shop for $93.49.
The student at Brigham Young University for the last year Matt Casaday, 25 years, says he bought a book "Strategic Media Conditions: Understated The Business End of The Advertising Business" used by Amazon.com for just 0.42 online shops.
A new book would have cost $48.
At Massachusetts University of Amherst's College Without Walls, Director of Ingrid Bracey and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if they can use the previous editions of the course.
Sometimes reforms in the new edition are not essential for teaching.
In this case, the old edition can only be found with a fraction of the price that should pay for the new one.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon book stores, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular shopping venue for used books.com.
Renting
It is worth considering the rental of books if you take good care of them, remember to return them and do not need them for your course.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, the rental of the 'Calculus' book for the whole academic period costs about $20.
See the rules of the leased company, such as notes, the use and wear of the highlight pen for the following payments.
Renter, please: if you forget to return the book, the late fee may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
Buying e-books instead of ordinary paper can also be a question.
Sometimes these books are rented when the right to use an e-book is paid to its holder, e.g. Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Chegg store will give you an e-book for six months with about 61 dollars.
Bracey says that many of the literature students save most because many classics can now be downloaded for free, whereas the books in science and technology can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing between different sellers, which option you will choose.
Joe Gault, who will soon start in Pepperdinen's legal sciences, recommends that you use the ISBN number to settle the price because it will help you to ensure that you are looking for the correct book.
Before you order a network, make sure the book is in stock, Gaul says.
He himself learned through this point of view.
The delivery of the book he bought was over for four weeks, and he eventually had to obtain the book at full cost from the university bookstore.

In fires, almost double dead almost double the number of people who died from fires compared to last year compared to last year.
The fires have died this year almost twice as many people have died compared to last year.
According to the media surveillance of the Finnish Rescue Centre (Spek), 55 people have already died in 49 different fires by now.
At the same time last year, the burn school was 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
Over 65-year-olds have been 11.
According to the fire deaths statistics of the organisation, the worst situation was last year in 2009, when 64 people died in fires by the end of August.
Most fire deaths occur in apartments.
There have been 17 fire deaths in the floors, 21 home homes, and seven in row and other small houses.
Mr. Spek reminds me of the repetition of fire safety at home.
At least the performance of all home fire alarms should be ensured according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial adjustment devices are readily available.
All homes must also have an accessible exit route.
The children should also be told what electrical devices they are allowed to use when they are alone at home.

French Socialists should " shut quiet and help France", says Francois Hollande's main supporters, says French Socialists.
Valls urged the deeply divided left to the socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of a new government did not obtain the approval of a majority of French people.
The President deserves respect for everyone, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our mission is to stay close to him", Valls said, "and earned the honors.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister asked the government to leave peace in spite of the 35-hour working week of the French controversial 35-hour working week, the new Minister for Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, on a proposal which raised the debate earlier this week, for the rule to be reduced.
Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to act with the Government of the Joint Society.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, brought an evasive response to the meeting of socialists who have expressed differing opinions, and criticising the Socialist Party that it would allow "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, director of the Estonian National Front Party, mocked the ongoing conflict between socialists and said that he would not believe that the new government of Valls would be longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but also Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the last time he didn't even last summer.
"And the new government won't last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal for the break-up of the Parliament and was sure that his party's election elections would take place early, and he himself would be prepared to lead the party.
The ruling party of the French regime suffered a crush in March's gymnastics, and the extreme right held a list of the EU elections in May.
According to the opinion of the Journal du Dimanche magazine, 76 per cent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may break down into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political researcher at the University of Poscal, warned us that the French will soon lose their patience unless the new Socialist Government succeeds in improving the economy and record-high unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public should quickly notice that the change is happening" he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka was betrayed by the morning’s planners Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and the meteorologist Pekka Poudan’s son were badly deceived by the recording part of the program.
Last Thursday, the Finnish Programme published a fun video on its website about recordings made on Thursday.
On video, planners Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahkola as well as meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the morning's advertisement from the next day's broadcast to Finland, but the recording does not go very well.
Alm-Sira goes crazy when he tries to say a word in the budget row, and his confusion also makes Pouda and Rahkola lose the box all the time.
And these heroes should be allowed to withdraw a live broadcast tomorrow," said the morning of the Facebook update in Finland.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both nice and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.

A meeting of the Socialist International Assembly was held at the Helsinki Fredrikinkatu Building Manager's House in May 1971.
There were many Heads of State and the security were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven guards went with him.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we received more than five minutes to describe it.
I took this picture in four or five meters.
The light and the background were right.
Now I understand that this time I did it.
It seems to me that the leaders of the Middle East have been having a hard time before.
In that event, you were able to compete with the images taken from known persons or events.
It is great that today you can also succeed in other images, as long as you have an idea and visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've ever taken.
The best is the Lasse Virén fall from the Munich Olympics.
I didn't send it to the competition.

In this way, Jyri Rajamäki Jyväskylä assessed the research of IT at the University of Jyväskylä.
The border suggests that the law enforcement of police activities and the fight against crime could be significantly improved by combining research and judicial IT systems.
According to the limit, modern technology allows multiple use of criminal technology.
He notes that it is possible to build a system in which the information collected to investigate the crime is automatically an electronic evidence that meets the evidence chain and, at the same time, provides comprehensive law enforcement.
The opposition will be checked on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "The Kasvisdiedis belongs to fish and chicken dishes".
The picture of the special information found on the wall of the school wall of women’s trip to Turkey caused food in social media, says Yle’s website.
Vegetables!
Fish and chicken dishes belonging to the school lunch.
Only when there is meat on the list will we prepare a vegetable option.
In this way, it is noted that the school wall was forgotten in a 15-year-old bulletin.
You're going to get the picture out of here.
The image spread in social media has been given by people to send Pirkala's dissatisfied feedback to the government of Pirkkala.
The Head of Food and Cleaning Services Arja Vaarma says to Yle that the lost note on the wall is not true and should have been deleted shortly ago.
Apparently, before I arrived, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been debated in due time with health care.
Each student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says to Yle.
Today, at Pirkkala schools, students will be offered a plant-food option only with the permission of their parents and with a certificate from a doctor or nurse on vegetable diets.
The risk is based on the solution to Yle by the fact that young plant-food experiments may leave food shortages and the absence of meat or chicken can give rise to a miracle of the parents of pupils.
Norwegian Cruises nearly $3 billion worth of a Prestige Cruise agreement worth nearly $3 billion.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O., the third largest cruise company in the world, negotiates to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for three billion dollars.
In addition, a Norwegian Cruise company with a market value of EUR 6.8 billion would be able to use the Prestige Cruises company's luxury cruises and the rich customers as it continues to compete against more Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RFL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies.
According to the sources, information on the possible agreement may already be published this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private venture capital company, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want their names public because there was no public consultation.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruises and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments and the Commissioner refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
The net sales increased by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when net sales were USD 2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, still operating in Miami, has the Oceania and Regent brand name, which includes eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavian, Russia, Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The net sales in 2013 were USD 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
A $ 29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the increase in emerging economies, such as China and India, in the coming years.
The companies compete to become the first option for these new customers when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises register on the US stock market for the first issue of shares in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares after the 2007 trade, which was worth USD 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in 2000 in its current composition with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL) rating company. The latter is the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay’s entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, the share of Genting in the company was 28 per cent, Apollo 20 per cent, and the share of TPG Capital LP was 8 per cent from the end of June.
A total of 82 per cent of North American cruise capacity, calculated by Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises, shows the registration document published by Prestige Cruise as part of the transfer of shares of Prestige Cruise.
The City Government of Tampere is addressing this issue today.
Animalia hopes that the city government will support the firm support of the initiative.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, CEO of Animalia, University of Tampere, it is necessary to put an end to the rapid end of dolphins in Finland and around the world.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there is a generalised view that the presence of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is not animal health or ethically sustainable.
This view would also be desirable for Tampere.
The abolition is not only a matter of animal law, but also a question of the image of Tampere as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara points out.
According to the jury, the death of Näsi dolphin will strengthen the requirements for the delfinarial activity down-down.
The death that I saw is a sad continuation of the dark history of Särjänniemi dolphinism.
It is time to put a point on death, close the dolphin prison and start to find out how the Tampere dolphins could be moved to a limited marine area, a sort of dolphin shelter, the Thomas risk requires.
This did not allow us to experience the return of dolphins to the original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in Särkännane have been able to experience more life than their unbridled concrete, the Judge of the Day.
The aim of the Animal Protection Association for Animal Health is to prohibit the use of all wild animal species in circuses from the overall reform of the veterinary legislation in which they are manufactured.
There are also dolphins in this group.
In support of this claim, Mr Tuomivaara, Executive Director of Animalia, will take part in today's 1.9.- on behalf of dolphins.
The spirit of the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki will be taken into account in Japan against the starting dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting period, approximately 2300 dolphins are imprisoned or killed annually, either for the use or for food of dolphins.
Putin insists that Kieva should open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine to open negotiations with the new state with the countries of Eastern Ukraine to open negotiations with the new state with the countries.
Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stop fighting against separatists in eastern eastern Ukraine and immediately start negotiations on the 'state' of a different area, the Russian news sources tell us.
His representative Dmitry Peskov later clarified that Putin did not mean that the Separatist region of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be reconsidered in order to give the Russian-speaking region its people the power to defend their own rights and interests.
The demand of the Government of Putin to the Government of Kiev for negotiations with the Russian rebels, in a balanced manner, corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help the Separatists take over the territory and thus force the Ukrainian Government to effectively admit to the newly declared Novorossija independence, which enables it to run instead of the West of Russia.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 channel, Putin condemned Ukraine's military efforts to take back the Eastern Donetsk and Luhansk region, dominated by Separatists in March and April, following the accession of Moscow to Ukraine to Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently taken up the region as "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term reminds us of the days of the spell that followed the revolutions of the Russian great power.
According to Itar-Tass, the Russian press office in Itar-Tass said that the planned peace negotiations are "interconnection" as long as Ukraine's politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections to be held on 26 October, and the government forces attacking the separatist regions against civilians in the separatist regions.
"We must immediately enter into a wide-ranging consultation, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the status of the state of South-East Ukraine, which takes into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskovi, Putin's reference to 'nationality' is linked to a broader independence, which has been debated for months with the Kiova management, in order to dispel the fears of Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights would be threatened by threats.
Only the Ukrainian Government can grant eastern regions the independence they need, says Peskov.
There is no debate on this matter between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov says, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is an internal conflict in Ukraine'.
The Greek representative’s statement, which was intended to correct Putin’s comments on the 'false interpretation', stressed that the Russian regime is dealing with the rebellion of the separatists in the eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, when it practically took over the territory of which the majority of the 2 million people of the population are ethnically Russians.
Moscow would be much more difficult even to link the regions of Donetsk or Luhansk in East Ukraine, because most 6.5 million people in the region are not ethnically Russians and, according to pre-conflict opinions, the majority of the population were in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would give Ukrainian local governments the right to agree on their own trade agreements and their external relations, which would, in practice, give the Kremlin the power to form part of an area which combines Russia with the Crimean Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, which was linked to Russia five months ago, is located in the Russian major fleet, as well as the port areas and historic coastal sites of commercial shipping.
The Russian territory between Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal alloys that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators, after new elections, consider constitutional changes in order to increase the decision-making powers of regions from Ukraine's nuclear regions on their own economy and the position of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to differ strongly from the views of Kremlin and Moscow, perhaps the Separatists of weapons and flames.
Putin's latest demand was for the Kiev Government to negotiate with Russian rebels on a level playing field after the rebels moved more Russian tanks and troops from the former peaceful region of eastern Ukraine to the Sea of Azov last week.
Ukraine's security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovski, the separatist separatist separatist, is the beginning of a greater effort to take over the entire strategicly important coastal area until Crimea.
It has led to massive civilian and military staff implementing the strengthening of the city of Mariupol. Mariupol, a population of about half a million people, is known as a steel-producing port between Novoazovsk and the narrow land area leading to Crimean Peninsula.
Mr Poroshenko spoke on Saturday, Brussels, to the leaders of the European Union, asking for further measures to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon receive a point that will not be returned," said Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take any decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed the drafting of further resolutions in order to enable them to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine re-emphasises under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaki region following the transfer of two Russian tanks and 1 000 soldiers last week to the Donetsk region in order to strengthen the Separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers in Ilovaki, Russia, were replaced by 10 Russian paratroopers who were imprisoned in Ukraine a week ago in the region of Ukraine.

The hacker has been told that he has a total of 60 naked stars from Lawrence and other superstars, such as the top model of Kate Upton and Cara Deleving, a singer from Riga, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as an actor from Kirsten Dunst.
The pictures of Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko, an actor from Australia, have apparently been stolen during the iCloud leak.
The list has 101 famous names.
Edelsten, who proposed to Grech last month, said to the Confidential, "This is disgusting."
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and disseminated.
The Greckon in New York is reported with comments on the case in the website as "sacred" and said that the victims "they feel ashamed".
Hacker is expected to have 30 photos of Palmer with this previous boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two samples of Palmer at the top of the pool at the edge of the pool.
For example, Palmer's films include "Love and Honor" opponent Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-series star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence's representative said to the TMZ that "it is a very poor violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Roge got angry with the hacker in his twitzer: "The publication of stolen images does not differ in any way from the sale of stolen products".
The publication of stolen images should not be made possible, even from a legal point of view.
