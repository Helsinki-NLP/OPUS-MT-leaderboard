Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain.
According to the mailman, in Spain, the police arrested Slava Gulevitch, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the underworld of Estonia, known as Slava Kemerovski, who is known as Slava Kemerovski, who is a member of the criminal community.
Gulevitch, arrested in Spain, was arrested with a court order.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspected arrests in Estonia.
It is suspected that this is the age of 27-57, the age of the so-called Kemerovo criminal community, who is mainly involved in drug crimes.
In the province of Malaga, Mijas, Spain, the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested.
Three men were arrested as suspected in Estonia, one of them has been collected according to data by the leading leader of a criminal community and two are members of a criminal community.
The data collected suggest that the tasks and roles of the criminal offences in the Community were clearly allocated.
The aim of the criminal community's action was to commit drug offences and thus to earn criminal revenue", commented on the director of the pre-trial procedure in criminal matters, Public Prosecutor Võur Verte.
"We do not rule out the increasing circle in this criminal case," added the prosecutor.
This is a matter of people who have been involved in law enforcement missions before, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
He stressed the importance of cooperation with Spanish colleagues throughout the entire investigation.
"International cooperation has become common to us, and this week's operation shows success", commented DA Verte.
Ago Leis, the chief of the Central Criminal Police Department, said that detentions were subject to a pre-trial investigation of almost a year and a half.
"In the first half of this year, long-term work was realised, and at the same time in Estonia and Spain, we had suspected crimes," he said.
He added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police were in favour of detention in Spain.
For years now, we have a good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and civilian security forces.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that men who have been suspected may continue to commit new crimes while staying in freedom, so that the prosecutor sought them to be arrested and approved by the Court.
A man arrested in Spain is waiting for his release to Estonia.
In the context of this case, property, vehicles and cash has been seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-criminal proceedings shall be conducted by the Central Criminal Police Organization and led by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court condemned Slava Gulevitch in 2005 and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the previous decade, Gulevitch was considered a second man in the Estonian criminal world following a then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovos, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to engage in blackmails in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and demanded monthly roofing fees from businessmen.
International joint operations, confiscating criminal income and rulings that have entered into force confirm that the fight in the field of organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the eight accused of the so-called 'Dikayev criminal criminal criminal offences' of which EUR 80 000 was seized, or the judgment in respect of nine persons, that Igor Aleynikov created in 2006 a criminal community aimed at the illicit trafficking in cigarettes and the prosecution of crimes involving trafficking in human beings in eastern Virginia and South Estonia.
The fined criminal income is approximately EUR 71 500 there.
In these criminal matters, progress has been made in ensuring that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day and, if necessary, cooperate with them in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Rights Group warns Missouri about travelling to Missouri.
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about State discrimination policies and racist attacks.
The Group’s statement says: “The NOACP travel mark issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and missionaries to be particularly careful and very careful when moving around the state as a whole, taking into account the suspicious racial-based events of the entire race which have recently taken place and have been presented here.”
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged by the recent Missouri Act to issue travel warnings, which makes it harder to win cases of discrimination more difficult, and also by the fact that the state's re-sponsors' targets are, to a large extent, not least the minority.
"Man's civil rights are violated.
They draw the edge of the road due to their skin color, beat or be killed," said President Rod Chapel of NAAACP Missouri's branch to the newspaper The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so tightly complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State of the United States of America.
The group referred to events such as racist insults on the direction of black students at the University of Missouri and Tennessee, 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, from the age of 28.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year in suspicious circumstances after he got out of gas running through state state, and he was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
In addition, the note to the recent report drawn up by the Attorney General of Missour shows that in the state, cars of black drivers are halted by 75% more likely than white-faced vehicles.
"It is meant for people to be aware and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri," says Chapel.
"The people must be prepared, whether it means taking bail or informing relatives that they are going through the state."
On the basis of the most recent data in the programme for informing the FBI about hate crimes, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which place the state's similar offences in a country through 16.
Travel alerts are also in response to the new law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for a company to sue a residence or work for discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Texas and Arizona after these States adopted immigration laws which obliged local powers to arrest people for immigration violations because ACLU said that it would increase racial profile.
Usually, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs gives out travel warnings for other countries, but recently interested groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What would anyone know about different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis or inflammation may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, there are chronic hepatitis B and C with adverse cost, which can continue to develop into hepatic cirrhosis, i.e. liver cortex and liver cancer.
The Agency’s Epidemiology advises Kutsar that signs of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver infection - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucosal tract.
The last symptoms also come from the popular name of the infection known as yellow fever.
Children may develop hepatitis without any signs of disease.
Different types of inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and pass for decades without signs of illness, which means that a person may not know anything about his dangerous liver disease.
Kutsar reveals different hepatitis forms and describes their course more closely.
hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when we eat contaminated food or drink water, by sex, from the faeces of an infected person to the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, exposure to the mouth and consumption of drugs.
The risk or risk group of hepatitis A belongs to family members and carers, people with chronic liver disease, people with sex with the disease, men sex with men, drug addicts, passengers visiting highly advanced hepatitis A countries.
The infection can be prevented in vaccinations, in particular by recommending vaccination for people who travel a lot and who are at risk of hepatitis A.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before taking food.
hepatitis B viruses are common during exposure to human blood, in the injection of drugs, in tattoos, ingestion, in the use of blood-bound parasites (skin-harves, laxatives), in the case of donor blood, in the case of sex with a person with a hepatitis, and from the mother to the foetus/born.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug addicts, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, healthcare, rescue workers and police officers, and passengers visiting highly ill countries with hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, people may be vaccinated; it is in particular recommended that they be vaccinated by persons in the risk group and by persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use, tattooing and shooting of foreign hygiene and manicure instruments, other instruments and injection needles, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex or prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is a part of the national vaccination plan and for children free of charge in Estonia.
hepatitis C viruses are common during exposure to human blood, in the injection of drugs, in tattoos, in breeding, in the use of blood-infested olanzapines, in donor blood, in the case of a person with hepatitis, and from the mother to the foetus/vasinal mother.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, infected human sex partners, male sex partners, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, healthcare, rescue workers and police officers, persons with HIV infection, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis C disease.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoid the use of foreign hygiene and manicure tools, other retaliation tools and injection needles, tattooing and shooting, and the use of condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
hepatitis D causes hepatitis D viral loads which are multiplied by hepatitis B virus presence.
Consequently, hepatitis D infection with hepatitis B or as a superinfectant in chronic hepatitis B patients is present.
D hepatitis D viruses are spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, their contaminated injection needles, by gender and rarely infected mother to the foetus.
D The risk group for hepatitis is chronic hepatitis B viral carriers and people who are not immune to hepatitis B hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against infection with hepatitis D virus.
These hepatitis viruses spread on a fecal oral route with drinking water and food, including a small amount of hot-treated meat, fish and shellfish, donor blood, common syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Passengers may be infected with E hepatitis in highly ill countries.
The prevention measures for this hepatitis are hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after taking a toilet before cooking and eating after taking care of the patient.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating little hot-treated beef, fish and seaweeds, drink only safe drinking water and avoid taking drugs.
While on the last round the competitors tried to push four Olympic winners off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength at the end of the race and won at 26.49,51 in time.
Farah didn't think long, pulling after the finish with him into the track with his husband Tania and his children.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the track was wonderful," said Farah to journalists.
In London, Farah will target the fifth title competition in a row of 5,000 and 10,000 metres of running gold doubles.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor "Daam in gold. Gustav Klimt's masters, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait is an extraordinary story" from the birth of one of the works of art much deeper to the culture of the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But more and more thoroughly in time.
It would have taken advantage of an admirable rumor, perhaps a stronger tip, a narrower theme would have been released in the title to get more influence on the extraordinary story of the portrait allowed in the headline.
At the moment, it would be like two books: Gustav Klimt and his painting of "Dam in gold" by Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much larger and more comprehensive history book of respected Jewish families and German occupations, along with its consequences in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle and who himself is the capital city of Austria, it may even be hard to imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went around Ringstra, or how all the heads in the Central Coffee turned when Klimt entered.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe's rich cities, and when you see a name in the book, you feel more like a gram of culture.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud acted in a city where incurable syphilis and was the highest level of suicide in Europe, creating a development that does not give rise to anything else.
Or perhaps - even one of the double-silicons adds colors to the cultural life of the early 20st century in Vienna.
Union travel to the Union of the Soviet Union
In the last few decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the centuries, almost every ten people of Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married herself twice as early as the Czech beetle Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt played for her famous paintings, her father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg empire.
But Adele's whole glamorous life, where she belonged, didn't pull it.
If you look at "Dam gold" it's hard to believe that in the end of life, this great lady was infested with socialism and dreamed of a journey from the Soviet Union to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait from Klimt, his wife was the last minute's hotest painter in Vienna.
Klimti's order was paid at that time by 4,000 kroons, a quarter of a good location for the house price.
The fact that for some portraits, a master's love story was suspected of being a model, the sugar magnate did not throw away.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only fact that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed in the course of the work continued for the rest of life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor-- "Dam baby.
Gustav Klimt Masters, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait extraordinary story", Varrak 2016, translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Right before the start of the work with Adele, Klim had been to Ravennas San Vitale in the basilis, and researchers think that it was the brilliant Muslims from the Emperor Theodora who had given the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele painted as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dam gold" in Vienna in 1908 and about the same time (from 1907 to 1908) another golden land "Sudulus" was born.
Art historians did not miss the similarity of two women.
What is the story related to Hitler?
"I think I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public", Adele Bloch-Buer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wanted their family Klimti collection to go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klim had prepared another portrait from Adele.
Also in his will (Ade left in February 1925), he asked that his spouse leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes on Austrian Gallery.
Her jewelry gave her to her niece Mary and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from "Austrian Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the University of Fine Arts of Vienna to get to 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed to draw through the morning.
Although Hitler’s later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him at the academy, none of his investigators were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Gallery referred to in Maria had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find a pleasant job for the Nazi parties in Vienna from the rich Jewish churches.
Hitler's personal art property was also suitable for some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the natural art robbery, a ten-year trial began between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauerite.
At this point, it should be noted that if "Sudus" is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then the "Dam gold" pictured by Adele Bloch-Bauer should be seen to travel to New York Neue Galerie.
And before the tour of Vienna, read the book.
Even if you do not plan to go to Klimt's work because at least my emotions rolled more Nazi and Jewish issues after closing the book than the painting sold for $135 million and the model Adele Bloch-Buer around Adele Bloch-Buer.
So not so much portrait, rather than the fate of the family - and a very moving story.
The Bauerite family tree, originally mentioned in the book, greatly facilitated the orientation of events.
The 17-year-old swimr in Canada was very close to the record of Estonia.
The gold was very close to the personal record of 200 m of its own self-braining, swimming 2.16,62.
Tipppmark comes from the 17-year-old peak of the week's membership when the Canadian Junior Championships took over the time of 2.16,58, brokering Priit Aaviva's Swimming Block.
Gold got the last one, or the tenth A-final.
In the final he passed through the distance with a period of 2.15,76 and reached a good seventh place with a powerful new peak.
The Estonian record of Alina Kendzior (2.15.13) remained slightly more than half a second apart from Gold.
The third table of all time in Estonia rose to gold, and his new personal peak is the fifth result of all time.
The young hope for the future is still taking place in Canadian adult championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m of freeness and 200 m and 400 m of complexion between 200 m and 400 m.
Last week, in Toronto, there was a concert of Canadian Juneors, and Gold made a successful start there as well.
He won 200 m of free spirit with a silver medal time of 2.03,22.
So quickly it was flooded by the distants of Estonia last year in 2008.
Over time, only the Estonian record material Elina Partõka has swimming this distance in Estonia.
In Canada, Estonia, still won 100 m of the probes medal in its release, with an excellent personal record and 56.66 of the new Estonian season peak.
For example, a year older Kertu Ly Alek has been swimming this distance only one century faster.
He reached the top of the personal peak by receiving 100 m of the wind-up message in the opening opening of the notice period, letter time 1.03,69.
In a half-witting distance, he only reached the seventh position when he swimming in the finals of 2.17,31.
Gold is currently running the Estonian season agenda for four different distances.
President Trump goes on a vacation, critics with stretched teeth.
The holiday time is in hand - it also means relaxation to the President of the United States of America Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has so far taken out one of the most holidays, critics are already stretching their teeth.
According to Today and CNN, the president is planning a 17-day holiday in his own-named golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, New Jersey.
Despite the beginning of the president's holiday yesterday, the Trump opponents have already taken a week's floor on holiday.
They throw Trump too often to rest.
It is the President's custom to spend the weekend in his villa in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president during his 196th anniversary.
For example, George W. Bush was able to spend 67 days on holiday, and Barack Obama was half less than Trump, but only 21 days.
But Trump's going to have a quick sleep of things.
A number of days after becoming president, Trump said "60 minutes" that for long rest, there will be no time for his father, because a lot of time needs to be done.
He also expressed his resentment three years ago about Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter: "At the time Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting its heads off for journalists."
There is no relaxation in a 17-day club visit to the White House officials' notice.
It is officially called a job leave, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other activities of pleasure.
In addition, employment leave must have another reason.
The White House's western air conditioning system was replaced and therefore the entire staff had to leave.
The West is also located in Ovalalabinet and other office rooms of the President.
"I don't think any of you would like to be in the west of August if there's 38 degrees and there's no conditioner", said White House speechist Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue working during his vacation.
From the day President Trump spends 17 days, you'll get a sense of the video.
Blocking the criteria on Facebook do not apply to the State Office unless you tolerate the criticism of voters.
The father of our country knew a lot about disadvantaged media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the papers didn't take long to get rid of him for everything from internal politics to political principles.
Critics, of course, upset him.
But he didn't make her silence his criticisms.
Because in 1783 Washington said that "freedom could be removed from us, and dark and silently, we could be led to slaughters like sheep."
This will bring me to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more Washington-like.
The Hogan subordinates have blocked and erased at least 450 people’s posts, who published their opinion on their official Facebook page.
In the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union ACLU) appealed to it for this reason.
The governor's department found the action void and the web comments were against the countermeasures in the style "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook," said many.
But it does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a democratic state.
His approval percentage is, in fact, the country's 50 governors, right at the second position.
Hogan is not a thoughtless reactionive buffoonhead.
He has led the state on a firm hand and remained firm in his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters rather badly by presenting, for example, the first time after chemotherapy, a lazyly smartly head of his bald head.
Thus, the governor's newspaper is an officially marked public forum, managed by blocking people who are visiting from taxpayers' dollars who pay for their salary is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan press editor Amelia Chase defended the interview with the governor of the Washington Post, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of internet roles, spam mailers or people full of anger online.
The Post talked to a number of real people who Hogan blocked.
And that's exactly what they are really people who communicate with their chosen leaders, teachers, owner of the company and pastor, not online roles.
They all said that their comments were respectable, thought-out, and, at all, non-probable.
In his post, the pastor quoted the Bible as a reference to Hogan’s Catholicism.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, from Matthew Bowie, did not encourage anger, but rather about some kind of hate crime.
"I politely understood that I am disappointed because he has not reacted to hate crimes or any other recent news," he wrote in The Post's newsletter comment state.
"I don't like the idea that how many people comment on the same subject, one of them immediately calls it a collective effort, rather than admitting that it is a great deal of concern to citizens."
What the governor's staff called "a targeted spam attack" would probably call "public support" by others.
Facebook time allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking criticism or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than it used to be when workers had to be sent out to do the same, so that they would collect newspapers with critical instructions and burn them or arrest the protestors and make them silenced.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for de-threating Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been suing Twitter users who are blocked from Twitter's stream.
One of the first rulings on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
The U.S. circuit judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria decided that the chairmanship of the Loudouni County Supervisory Board violated the first revision of the Constitution when he blocked the voters from his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited ACLU on Facebook and Twitter after using Governor Matt Bevinit (R).
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, the cost of mail at affordable rates had a similar effect to that of the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers destroyed his manner of management.
And even then, Washington had to wear anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters under such pseudonyms as Juricola, Valerius, Belize and Portius, making Washington's decisions to the country.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of the web-based George Washington collection project, he buried himself under petitions in his office which criticised his views regarding the friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't make them keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, differences and discussions are the foundations of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to comfort home home home at the Renaissasance Club in Renaissance Club.
The previous European premiere Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort within the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northern American who was in charge of the last round on Archerfield Links in the neighbourhood last year before Paul Eales was under-represented, has become fond of the new location and is fulfilling the role of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad instead of the tournament ambassador.
"I saw the construction of the renaissance Club, and now we see the club with this event a perfectly glorious shine," said Raferty.
"Magics see the track in their best shape, it's in glorious condition.
Jerry's done a great job building this place.
He's a eager supporter of a golf game and he's proud of what's been achieved here.
It is an excellent way to present the track."
English Everes looks forward to protecting the title for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It sends a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't protect my Extremeu Open title because it was taken a year after my victory in the race calendar.
It's magical to come back to that field.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember memories of last year, for me and my wife, Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always bear in the heart."
On the soil of the country, Gary Orr will return to the competition, who joined the European tour of the Seniors to the beginning of the year when he became 50.
It is his first event in Scotland following the participation of Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"The home to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to do well, but at the same time you also feel extra stress.
I've had a lot of fun playing again and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things are going."
The Trio joins the former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnam and senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder's Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six warriors in the final race, the rest of them are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Poverty and death in Indonesia, gold-green country
When Bartina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a pencil.
He's rarely even using pot.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotali, capital of the Pania Regent of the province of Papua, Indonesia's tarmac is placed directly into a firehouse by the home family member in the local language called nota.
After half an hour, the coaled musket is taken from the fire, and the hand of washed hands is firmly skinned.
Degei sits on the floor of the mud without furniture, and he does his daily household chores, for example, washes the cloud water from the swamp nearby.
The current role is to fill the bucket without roofing in the room.
Since he is the youngest of four women in his wife, he is not appointed to care for any farm.
Polygamia is common around here.
However, working late may be dangerous most of the village men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit the village after five nights," he says.
This is a rare insight into the implementation of the Papua Mountains. It is a former Dutch colony that was added to Indonesia in 1969 to create a referendum that forced only 1026 seniors to vote in the sight of the okupian forces by raising their hands.
The freedom of the Dutch authorities has led the movement towards its rage quickly against the Jakarta government, which still maintains its strong control over the region by avoiding foreign journalists and human rights guards.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papuas and West Papuas, so the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enotal is both a distance and a deserted place. To reach this, you have to fly from the capital of the province to Nayapura for 90 minutes to Nabire and then pass the five-hour journey to be delayed by the rental car.
There is no transport.
The town of about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by the bars and covered by the waves of iron roofs, which roses have transformed different tone into yellow brown browns.
Very few Indonesians have taken their way here, not to mention journalists, nor have they been to nearly any foreigner.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the priests of Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, referring to the turban, dark shirt, and erx skirt, which we used to wear by hand on our colored stick.
"We used to wear it on the body only plant leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and lack of literature are one of the worst in Asia.
But this is also a land of gold in Indonesia.
Just 100 km from Pania, which is about a mountainous province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants, is located in the world's largest and most profitable gold mine Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined gold and copper worth approximately USD 3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with consumer timber stocks, with an estimated value of USD 78 billion.
However, these violations are a source of the suffering of the popes, as they result in a heated presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times 2005 survey showed that Freeport paid some USD 20 million to local military and military units between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 1500,000 to a single officer.
The efforts of the Pope to ensure greater autonomy threaten this goldenhane and walk around them mercifully.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 refugees have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the Committee on Human Rights in Asia, the mass killing of genocide in the mountains of Papua tribes in the 1970s was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3,300 peaceful protestors were arrested in the Indonesian police area.
The 2016 report of the Birsbane Headquarters, "We're all losing", contains statements of the cruelty committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (a second report indicates that violence and power shootings are particularly common) and the brutal death of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of lawyers is hard to count, as such incidents take place every week," says Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch Indonesia.
Kruvid is even more turned off because Papua's natural resources have caused the inflow of newcomers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but demographics are changing, as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the Indonesian population of Jaava, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes.
The Javas family dinners sell chips and mixed vegetables gado-gado, which are served with peanut sauce.
Locals can't compete with them.
"Migrands began to sell chicken and vegetables more cheaply than local beans on the traditional market," explains Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapara, the capital of the province on behalf of the work.
"The oil-cold beans are therefore losing their market share.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised in his 2014 election campaign to deal with their inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
On his way to Jakarta’s presidential visit from the 29 electoral districts of Papua, 27 including Pania.
But the Pope's very few changes, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014, we voted in favour of Jokowi in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, Pania was in a low state only two months after he entered the Jokowi October.
On December 7th, 2014, 11 children were singing at Enarotalis's fire for Christmas when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from the darkness on a motorcycle.
The local kids told them they should turn on the front lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was insolvent on their voice radio and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers were chasing children and beating them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
One child, from 16 years old Yulianus Yemmaot, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby election commission building was set on fire, and the next day things continued to decline.
About 1000 young Papua men, women and children gathered together to claim justice in front of the local police department and the military control centre in front of the football court.
They wore ceremonial yachts and presented the Papua honey pago tribe waita dance, where they ran around and copied a bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police and the military.
In the event of an aggravation, soldiers were sent via an inside radius. "If the crowd is more than three times resistive, shoot them," according to the official document, which has been seen in the magazine TIME, but which has not been issued to the local media publications.
The town of Kego Koto, the oldest in the district of Kego Koto, in Yeeremia, Kayame (56) felt a threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking people to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen to me.
"When turning around, I was shot suddenly into the left wrist," he said to a magazine TIME in his erect colors on the veranda of a wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who was the shooter, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the gathered soldiers.
"There was a lot, a lot of fire," he adds.
Local man Alfius Youw got three times when he got shot by his cousin, said he hit three times.
"I ran into him and studied his body to make sure it was with him," said TIME darkly Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that she was dead... I kissed her."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that he would be subject to return only to his station's security because it was attacked.
"We need to protect ourselves if we are threatened to kill," said Papua Police Press Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's a question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watchi, five young protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news about the killings came to Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayavuras gave a passionate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it would never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an extra-judicial mechanism to deal with human rights crimes.
But almost immediately, excuses were followed.
"Some of these crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and in the early 2000s.
The point is, we are committed to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
On June 5th in Jakarta, the magazine Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he has no intention of establishing a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said that "all things will be settled according to the law."
Wiranto, accused by the UN of crimes against human rights in connection with the death of more than 1000 people in East Timor during the blood independence regime in 1999, said 11 crimes against human rights have already been solved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania accepted such claims with a dark bulwart.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives scary.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'm being shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the people of Pania are afraid to break this incident.
He said he got beat up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"From the funeral of the dead bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Panic Neighbouring Region in Deiyais.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when he entered the village and the head of the building, who refused to transport an unconscious man to a hospital.
This male, 24-year-old Ravinus Douw, who sank fishing into a nearby river, died on his way to a hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers set up police officers with stones to which the latter responded with warnings.
But according to the locals, the mobile brigaad (Indonesia military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge," said TIME 29-year-old Domininggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw injured persons coming in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the police involved to take responsibility for the matter and to withdraw a mobile device from the region.
Pania has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of thoughtless development feeds the dissatisfiedness of the honey, many, Dani and damal tribes living in the suburbs of Papua.
Many of them have joined the army of the Free Papua Movement (VPL) rebels, which, according to them, defends the rights of the Popes by conducting occasional attacks and kidnapping attacks among Indonesian soldiers.
Some VPL drivers come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army has, in recent years, arrested in Pania and duly held thousands of people in custody in advance of the 'Proliferation of the sovereignty of the state'.
Some of them will never show up again.
The pope's people are known as Paniad as "a tragic forgotten place".
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
A small amount of rice sold in Enarotalis is too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is the same as unavailable.
People grow all their food themselves mainly in Batatá, in addition to some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Under-harvesting is the work of women, each of whom is able to provide care for four or five Batad fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest to their families, the rest sells on the local market.
Ten bats only cost 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between indigenous refugees and new migrants, which have reached a great deal since the opening up of new routes at Nabire airport.
These few jobs that exist are going better for educated and more wealthy migrants.
There is often no capital or the necessary skills for a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs and no money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Panian Council of tribes.
The isolation keeps the world's eyes off the Pope.
In addition to the external media, tough restrictions remain.
From the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Bailey Longchamp were sent out from Papua because "they did not follow the appropriate practices", although they had been granted a rare permit to film.
According to Vice-President Phelim Kine of the Human Rights Watchi Department, the pledges made by Jokowi have not been implemented to eliminate the restrictions imposed on reporting in order to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report from the eastern most troubled provinces of Papua and from Western Papua are threatening new threats to visa rejection and the entry of the black list," he said in his statement.
The absence of an eye on the press means that international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited to Papua's near neighbours.
In March, six Pacific countries encouraged Tonga, Nauru, Beau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to investigate "some large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Panama.
These same countries have historically supported VPL as well.
Arrmanatha Nasir, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, dismissed the group's accusations, saying to the journalist Jakartas: "In Indonesia there is still democratic order and freedom of the press, so that evidence of human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want to see more foreign governments.
On 4 May, when the official delegation of the Netherlands led the country's human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar to visit Jayapura, the local people stayed at the meeting, but anonymously, according to the source of the desire to remain silent, asking: "We want freedom."
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the popes do not believe that they will vote again in favour of Jokow.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, President of the Council of tribes.
He wants to understand that, in addition to the fact that the people of Pania are constantly living under threat from a predatory military, they are struggling with the nygels because of education and health services in poverty.
According to Gobai, the people of Pania, like the other popes, consider their voice given to Jokow as debt debt that he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Pania's shooting victims were able to cope with the last symbolic counterattack they buried one of the victims' bodies in the police station and the military base in the country that was opposite the country.
Knowing that justice may never be set on foot, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a reduced head.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed the Dubai Torchi cloud blower for the second time in front of yourself.
On Friday, the fire threw through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, making hundreds of inhabitants escape from this 337 meters high and 79-storey building.
It's another fire that's been destroyed in just two years by a high-fire called the Torchi, or the Tower of Storm.
The building was evacuated, no injury was reported and no direct cause of the fire was presented.
"We slept and woke up on fire alarm and screaming at people.
We were drinking down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil protection officers, firefighters erased the flame around 4 a.m. in the morning by the local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident can once again raise questions about the safety of materials used throughout the world for high construction outdoors.
The investigation carried out by the Torchi Board after the fire in 2015 found that the most damage was decoupling panels and isolation of the fascados - external surface.
The British police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenfel Tower and the fascinate panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, in which about 80 people were killed.
See: These phones are probably going to be selling in the autumn.
In spring and autumn, it is a sweet time for technical fans, since then telephone manufacturers will make their new top models public.
In spring, Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came for sale in the spring, as well as in the autumn there are new hit-phones waiting for the posters.
According to Kristjan Seema, today's flagship is characterized by innovative design, visual scanner, Servast-servan 4K resolution on the screen and the high-speed processor.
In the world of technology, Samsung Galaxy S8, which has also reached the front of the Estonian smartphone sales table, created great satisfaction.
In the autumn, the smart people are even more likely to have a fast download, a more durable battery, a better quality camera, and greater water and dust security.
He added that the rumors already show that you can assume and predict four top models that are probably taking over the sales tables tonight.
These four peaks of smart phones will reach the poets in the autumn of this year.
Long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the poets by mid-September.
You hear what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do is spread a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences between iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be completely distinguished from the previous model.
Four colors have been spoken of: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
The new design of one of the elements is probably the screen that covers the whole phone's front panel, has lost its home button and the fingerprint reader is built in the screen.
Apple designer JonyIve requires a new iPhone model to look like a smooth glass.
There has also been a story about the ceramic version of iPhone.
A11 processor is expected to be faster in addition to the eye-scanner, wireless loading and even more high-quality camera.
I'm sure it's one year's waitin' for smart phones.
A new model for Galaxy Note 8 will begin on 23 August.
There's been a lot of rumors about what new Galaxy Note 8 looks like.
I hear it's meant for even more business users, and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is wide and the other is a TV object with a narrower view.
At present, no one is able to know what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8 in quality terms.
But we look forward to it on 23 August.
Although Nokia has brought sales this year by three smart phones at the front of Nokia 6, their flag - Nokia 8, which is already being presented on 16 August, is still missing.
We're looking forward to Nokia's 5-to-be edge-to-earth screen and high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and more durable battery.
For Nokia, too, there is a talk about aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance to IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras produced by the company Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flag ship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphonees with even more innovative functions will be added.
We wait for a smartphone that is slightly more modest than XZ Premium, but at least with the same good or better camera.
For Sony's new model, it has been speculated that this screen is at least six to one.
In fact, we can see soon enough, because, traditionally, Sony has published the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to the leaked phone calls, Trump put Mexico under pressure in order to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post has released the telephone script of telephone calls between the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, Mexico and the leaders of Australia.
On 27 January Trump called the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, in order to end the public declaration that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States, he, uh, he was having a wall with him for a public conviction, saying, "You can't say it to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign promise to build a wall and a vow to make Mexico pay for this project throughout the southern United States of America.
His first speech was also published with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals an intense debate.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take refugees to Australia is "nearly", "neared" and "rubbed." He said that the agreement that was made during Obama's government would leave the impression of "hinger" as he has proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the United States of America.
Trump finished the call by informing Turnbull that "it was the day with the most unpleasant speech".
The Supreme Court did not take a complaint against the case in which the City of Tartu refused their tender for the procurement of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a letter which rejected the invitation to tender submitted by OÜ MRP Linna Liinid on the Tartu bus service, since the tender did not meet the requirements, Anneli Atithin, Head of the City Administration Service of Tartu explained.
This is a public bus service project within the city of Tartu for the 01.07.2019-30.06.2029 period.
The MRP City Liinis appealed to the Supreme Court for a decision of the District Court of Tartu.
The Supreme Court did not take any steps to deal with it.
Although many people in social media complain that the noise coming from the Weeend festival bothers their nighttime and that the whole town is filled with drunk parties, there are also many who have no bad words to say about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the parties at the store were so polite.
I didn't see any brightness or rudeness.
Even I saw the kindness," says Laine in the platter.
"It's a pleasure to be here, to be happy and feel the joy of Pärnu, which is winter as the winter is left," he adds with joy.
Laine's sleep is not affected by the beach-stamping darkest Laine sleep.
When he was living in the middle of the city, he still heard music playing on the beach, and now music hasn't reached his home bed yet.
"But I hope I can hear you," he says with joy.
Agnes, who talked to the evening paper, says that the big festival is more good for Pärnu - it is good for local traders.
He also rejoices that the summer capital has come to visit so many foreigners.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Although I don't have a day on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach's exhausted.
And I'm glad the people are moving, and it's been like this three times already," says the woman.
The first time it must have been a little worse.
"Then maybe there were complaints," he meditates on.
However, the noise on the beach, according to him, is common for summerheads.
"It's a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, which is at the park.
The noise and the dick haven't gotten his way of life to the point of life either.
What's up?
We should all stick together.
Think about how it would be better for this interethnic interaction.
The man of loud music won't be crushed.
It doesn't bother you, although I live right there.
"Good people can keep you together, and there's no trouble," he speaks.
The guests who came to Pärnu are, according to him, polite.
"With the bottles, they have, of course, been a little overreacted, but the young are young and the Lord's god - let's go, but be people and we can manage!" he says.
By this time, the people of the coast have traveled far away, whether to relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive effect on people like noise," says Tiina, who walks with Pärnu children.
His family's und festival music did not bother him either, although last year it came even further than this year's.
Last summer there was a stage on the other side, then we heard more.
We live out of the city ourselves, that it actually is going to take quite well to the river Pärnu," he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces the dividends to make business a re-resurrere re-re-resurrererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererererere re-rerererererererereree business.
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut down 3,000 more jobs and reduce its intermediates by 72 percent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to solve the threat of business distress.
The job losses, which, according to CEO John Fallon, are highly likely to be lost at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will result in a loss of 4,000 posts in the previous restructuring process.
In May, Pearson announced the plan to cut costs by another GBP 300 million (394 million USD) in the framework of the 3rd Cost Reduction Programme to try to reinvigorate the business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell the company Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month said that their expectations for the year have not changed since the 1-percent increase in sales revenue was reported in the first half of the year of GBP 2.05 billion.

Konvürnanna Kabul: suicide attack was killed a NATO soldier.
According to officials, the suicide bomber attacked the military forces in Kabul, the capital capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and several others in wounds.
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
Unconfirmed by local reports, three civilians were killed in an incident in Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have been hit by Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed by Herat's mosseryns.
On Monday, two people were killed by suicide bomber in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy.
The NATO declaration said that the Thursday evening explosion was held when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man entered with a self-made explosive".
According to the application, everything is in a stable state and is treated at the U.S. military hospital Bagram airport.
According to Correspondents, the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic Republic (ISIS) are always a serious source of concern for forces in Qarabaghi, NATO Bagrám, as well as for forces in NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017, approximately 20% of them in capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul mainly killed at least 30 people in the Shitite division.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed in the centre of the big bombing - it has led to the most deaths of military attack in the country since the US-led troops were depressed by Taliban forces in 2001.
This violence highlights the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while the US President Donald Trump is considering whether to increase the number of US troops that help the state's military and police forces.
According to Corresponsors, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghana.
The EPA withdrew the decision to postpone its decision to postpone the suspension decision decision of the suspension decision decision of the suspension decision decision of the suspension decision decision of the suspension decision decision of the suspension decision.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has withdrawn its decision to delay the introduction of the Obama-era regulation obliging States to limit emissions which are causing emissions to the environment, one day after 15 States appealed to the Court due to the progress of the Agency.
The EPA announced that it would continue with "with ozone detection operations 2015" on Wednesday, saying that this would show the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States Parties.
"We believe that we must hold and listen to our partners in the States," said Head of EPA, Scott Pruitt, in the statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the intention of rejecting ozone concentrations in different parts of the country for the purpose of determining where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to comply with the stricter air quality standard.
The 15 principally democratic states, together with the Columbia region, filed an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
According to Trump, this is part of a more comprehensive plan for economic growth.
But these efforts have caused reactions to the democracies and natural conservation groups, which are concerned about the increased effects of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhaling ozone-containing air "can reduce lung performance and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle may come at a party, as the strong rain threatens the catch of another wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be that the seasons of several weeks before harvest may mean that fruit intended for the bread industry can only be fed to animals for human consumption.
"The quality of this is far worse than last year and worse than 2015", Agravis Raiffeisen's analyst Bernhard Chilla said.
This year, up to 40 percent of wheat from wheat to feed for animal feed, which is doubled compared with normal, could go into Agravus forecast.
German farmers as well as their European colleagues have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry at first.
Then came the cold spring, which in June replaced the hot wave.
In July, there was a flood in Germany, which has continued in August too.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
Until then, only five percent of wheat have been harvested.
The harvest has not yet started in most areas, the local harvest buyer Ceravis announced the local harvest.
"It's a pretty complicated day," said Cevir's senior dealer Frank Deckert of Rentsburg.
Consisision of everything, or Finnish internal design plans for Finnish interior design programmes.
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the mess homes, because through large windows, Saimaa’s shores reach wonderful views in many (life) rooms.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will meet for the first time, discuss possible contradictions.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a collision rate to meet up to the most attractive box fight in the nearest future, up to 66,7 kg in weight, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in an ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to welcome the Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's sulgweight champion.
As a result of the unanimous decision taken by Garcia, the winning of the former four-fold world champion Adrian Bronger over Saturday's Showtime will be a pretext for both fighters in the weighing table.
Garcia handed his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19 in ESPN.
When a couple of photos were posted, Lomachenko's pineist Egis Klimas stated that a possible conflict between the fighters would be "perfect measurement".
"I've been former sulgweight," recalled Garcia.
"I fell up for the Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg small.
I want to move down lightweight.
And he must move upwards towards light weight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
The fans have wanted it.
Let us offer them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Oxyworld needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be paid to look at it. This is part of his strategy, according to which he wants to let Lomachenkol debut 61,2 kg in the class of this year in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 nokkatti), who also has an interest in fighting the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's fight against the winner of their lightweight match on 23 September at the Forum.
"Looking at this fight could be costly because fans have wanted this conflict," says Garcia, later saying that he is open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We're the main actors.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she thought Lomachenko was a great fighter, and she could go see her Saturday match.
Lomachenko, on the other hand, was modest in thanking Garcia, saying that he thought he saw three division masters from Riverside out "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted this knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the force of impact and then to box.
Both confirmed how they felt about how the tensions are growing into their wealth-making between them.
"This is a fight that is expected to be realised.
No other conflict creates so much attention and sumina.
I'm more than willing to work for this," says Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters and Mikey is exactly what I've been doing.
This will be a good fight."
What world corners are being moved from to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Agency (PPA) issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if a decision was taken to issue a temporary residence permit for 6702 foreigners, this figure was 4928.
The agencies cannot tell us how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be carried out at the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia every year ten years, in recent years this figure will reach close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased strongly during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014, 1087 people received a fixed-term residence permit, 675 a year earlier.
The data of the Statistical Office in Estonia are the highest number of Ukrainian citizens - last year, 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has been great in Estonia all the time, and due to complex circumstances in the country, it is natural that opportunities for work and learning are sought from a country where the community and many people are already ahead of the family", named Kristin Rammus, the Minister of the Interior.
The number of Ukrainians who had received a fixed-term residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although for 10 years the total number of permanent residence permits issued to the latter has been the highest number of residence permits issued to them over the last ten years.
If the Ukrainians come to work here for the most part, then Russian citizens are here for family migration.
"In view of the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, the Migration Researcher of the National Defence Academy.
"If you look at where Russian nationals who have been admitted to Estonia have moved to, Harjumaa has immediately moved to East Vietnam" he added and said that about 40 percent of them have married to a citizen of the European Union.
In the past, 1696 Russian citizens received a fixed-term residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians wishing to extend their residence permits decreased.
"It is because, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for for for permanent residence in Estonia", President Rammus, the Ministry of Interior, explained that Russian citizens' interest in Estonia's residence permit has remained stable for years.
New residence permits for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for from the previous year by foreigners who have lived here for at least three years.
Its aim is to encourage the survival of adapted people.
However, long-term residence permit requires, for example, five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also been reduced due to a new residence permit.
For example, last year, such a residence permit was granted to a 14-year student who has worked here for at least three years.
Now the Ukrainians can change their jobs and the Estonian state will no longer be surprised whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became very popular - applicants last year still have grey passport owners (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerian (36).
In total, 1968 people received a residence permit for the purpose of living in Estonia, including, for example, 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 grüsin and the same number of Chinese people.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has already been 1269.
In 10 years, the country that has become Nigeria is a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonia's residence permit.
When 2007 three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, last 200 were granted.
They come from Nigeria to study in these universities.
Estonian higher education institutions are still popular, for example, among Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to their study journeys.
They also have the rule that where the community has come forward, it will be easier for others" added Rammus.
In 10 years, two people have also moved to Estonia, for example from North Korea, the same number from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If an annual residence permit is granted to some 6,000 third-country nationals, this is about 0.46 per cent of the total population.
Even if more citizens of the European Union are concerned, immigration will remain around a percentage point," said Maasing, in fact, the number of small ones is small.
According to the Statistics Department, 14 822 people moved to Estonia last year, but 13 792 out of here.
This means that immigration crossed immigration for the second year.
Most of the e-mails and intruders are Estonian citizens, but more of them are among those who leave.
Therefore, the migration balance of Estonian citizens last year was less than 2,000 people.
The Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess is charming with sats, emm with emmu Couture and a fight.
There is still history for Maria Tammeoru: old paintings and costumes: "For hours, there is a museum to dream and admire old sleeves and collars.
If you do something with the kitchen, you study and learn about it every day.
This is the joy of discovery.
The glamorous world of Mammu Couture may seem to be living abroad, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine you've got in your life.
I have a girlfriend who's got a whole sauna full of the clothes of my grave couture that I created.
For it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on a red carpet every day; he also wants to wear and wear the most beautiful dresses.
You can live your own life special.
The fashioner does not recognize the gap between the shining events and the grey everyday day of the everyday life.
This reasoning led to a rolling plan to bring high-modes to places in Estonia, between forests and forests, to people, to which the fashion often does not reach.
Mammu collection was presented, for example, in Võus, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion hall, where 45 models of royal deficits filled the entire street with 45 models.
In Tallinn, people are often taken into the store, and they will be picked up with dignity, but there are more emotions - calling braavo, standing up, wanting to thank you for your hand.
A large part of the audience just came to renew, but now they're the fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be thrilled.
And I like the feeling that I'm feeling like I'm in a summer trip with a sense of taste.
We had a 50-metre red carpet, full of beautiful clothes all over the street, it seemed like they didn't even end.
Maria does not admit that the creation must be presented by supersale supermodel, she is happy to bring regular women to the stage.
Often I invite my own clients to the stage - they have always come with joy.
It's such a nice experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress.
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show myself, I've always been behind the stage to give the last couch to hopeless perfectionist things.
My nerve wouldn't let me take a easy look at the hall.
This is the kind of idea that does not just want to perform the representation role, but to be in everything on the hand.
I have my sewing machine at the studio, most of the collection itself.
I like the whole process you're playing with details, discovering.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design thing is not limited, but also stistics, logistics, organisation, organisation, organization - everything has to fit the day of a single woman's temperament.
These working hours are going to be a lot of work for the fanatics.
I can't even tell when my day is over, for me it's just a day full of joy.
I'm still very lucky - it's like an endless lucky chain: I do something beautiful, I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and in turn compliments.
How many times have it been said that my dress is magic - they make me feel like a princess?
The boring satsires that made Maria's talent famous over the night have remained the signature of Mammu Couture until today.
Martin Mürsepp U18 of the boys: the Estonian sub-group tournament weapon has now been turned against us against our opposition to our opposition.
Too bad, we're running out of fairy tales.
The first thing I saw was that we didn't get to our desk.
And when the table comes in, there's nothing to do", Estonia U18 commented on the remaining of basketball boys 61:75 for the UK our only NBA-playing basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo aide coach Martin Müürsepp.
The respondents took 28 balls from the attack table and therefore received so much more attacks.
We were not prepared for their aggressive protection or attack, it created .
Many of the English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we could not build up protection.
In defense, however, they were able to keep between hands, we couldn't combine them.
It hit the team's legs off.
Homework for the opponents was better done.
According to Mürsepa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the attack speed.
Last quarter, we had a zero error, but the opponents had already received several quick baskets.
Athleticity and close exploitation, which was our weapon on the sub-group tournament, have turned everything against us now.
Today we had no power against their aggression.
The salesman stayed calm with his guardian, Kalev, Matthias Tass.
In general, the tournament can say good words about the whole team, but until today, it's a single impact piece.
It's a shame you've already met an aggressive opponent before.
The pocket has always been self-conscious, and played it out today, but it seemed like he was tired - he's been wearing quite a heavy burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves that I've seen in training," added a mentor.
Folding numbers: In the lady's basketball box, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points at three quarters...
In the U18 age class, not only the young men’s EM B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls began their careers in Dublin.
And Estonia's game with Poland has, unfortunately, turned out to be an anti-refaction issue.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it stood 9:49, which was only the last ten minutes, the opponents took the foot from the gas pedal, and that period remained a reference 16:16.
In both the first and the second quarters, Estonia threw a 1 point in the fourth and third quarters...
At the same time, the Estonians first hit two of the first four rifles in two minutes, and then they hit 25 of the game, then one of the third in, and then another of the last 21 shots along...
In almost half an hour, 47 strange one was caught.
In addition, 2 of the four freeweeds came in.
The loss of the ball was a reasonable number of this time, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had a problem of 33% and Estonia had 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two losses, on the opening day Portugal was to be recognized as being better than Portugal 83:56.
The NATO vessels came to Tallinn to complete the supplies of the stock to be added to Tallinn.
Today, the NATO 1st Sub-Committee on Mines arrived at a scheduled port visit to Tallinn for the weekend to complete the fleets of ships and prepare for the pre-eminent exercises.
During the visit, ships are preparing to return to the sea and providing crew members with a chance to have a day-long holiday.
After a visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out a number of exercises and be ready for future historic explosive search operations.
"The Estonians' participation in and their co-operation in local waters reflects our integration with allies," said Commander Arto Reinmaa of the Operation and Planning Department of the Navy's Commander.
Since 29 June, NATO will be headed by the Latvian Marine Commander General Gvido Laudup, the 1st Deputy Commandant of the Latvian Air Force Group, who took over the duties of the group commander in Riga, Commander Johan-Elias Seljamaa, of the Estonian Navy Officer, from the Land of Seljamaa.
The flag of a group is defined as a Latvian Navy support vessel in LVNS Virsait, which is also the leader of a group.
During this half-year, the international unit will also be composed of the Estonian Navy mine hunter Sakala.
One of the four groups of vessels under the NATO Marine Command is the NATO 1st Sub-Senior Command Unit, which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
Until 13 August, the ancients of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where 13 years ago maestro Eri Klas introduced the Birgitta Festival to be performed by Magestro Erikis.
According to Risto Joseph (36), the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Festival can be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented according to Tallinn Philharmonic Festival.
Risto Joost: Tosca and the Ballets are among the classics of the opera world, and the "Bolrost" are the most amazing "Karlssonini" and there is no lack of the design of the concept of "The Great Orthorator" by Joseph Haydn, the same international creative team, who in 2015 brought the Pirital stage of Haydni's second titled "Loamine" by the same international creative team.
The Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre matches.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose charm takes power and never lets it open again.
For the experience that a listener can experience in this superior and mysterious environment makes human souls sound and touch human brains in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, for the first year, you're the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't maestro Er Erik's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Erik Erik, it's been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire college career and also supported me at the beginning of the division career.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue her work.
The special class has injected the Birgitta Festival team so much good and, of course, it will all be transferred to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work out.
It was the great heart of Special Kila that gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival of Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am now, and I can handle it.
What would be an exciting opportunity for the audience at the festival this year, which you are offering in particular?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a surprise, the first ballet that was written in the story of Astrid Lindgren.
That's what "Karlsson's flying" is for.
And one of the criminal nuances of this is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
He's probably had Karlsson's character since he was a kid.
Bitch, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner, I'm sure.
Such work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have it with a bump.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not depend as much on other people as I am, perhaps, on how I'm going to face every new day.
And such conscious tone, keeping positive and actually smiling in the mirror of your own morning morning, greatly increased my lucky percent.
Especially now this week, when you have the most important samples, I've been very much practicing it and it works.
The smiling of yourself acts in the brain and increases tone.
It's just not a word.
I think that people still don't know half the things about their own body that the universe offers them, but then everyone's going to find it even.
Right now, it's a matter of time.
Do you have any ritual before going to the conductor's cell?
Yes, the clothes have to be changed for more comfortable.
It's a little bit of a moment for yourself.
But, in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or make a little sleep before a big performance.
Actually, I like to talk to people actively, even before they go to the division board.
But all of you come to Birgitta Festival, here's what to find, not too much for a big opera and a ballet friend.
Have a fun video with Risto Joshua.
New results were published on the results of the evaluation tests for the age assessment of Swedish assyl importers in Sweden.
The latest results of the test show that more than 80 percent of the tested were evaluated as older than 18, but not everyone believes in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Medical Institute (Rättsmedicinalvertet) started testing by the beginning of this year.
The tests were established for a more accurate assessment of age in the course of the request for asylum after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticised for not having been able to correctly determine the age of many minors.
At present, the Migrationsverket has sent a total of 2481 test results for 6880 cases and the Court of Justice Institute has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) was assessed as 18 years of age or older and in 25 more cases, the Court of Justice Institute assessed that the "may be 18 years of age or older" could be tested.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that human being is probably " younger than 18".
The test is only used if the age of a person is questionable.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Justice, the results are consistent compared to those of previous months.
"We don't see much difference compared to last month's statistics, the numbers are fairly consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that most cases were considered to be older than 18, does not necessarily mean that they have lied about their age.
The Institute issued the results of the 581 test in May and said that in 442, there are indications that the subject is 18 years or older.
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagblade studied the results of their 581 tests, it turns out that 243 cases had been the person who had directly claimed that he would receive 18 this year.
This medical method of assessment of age, in which wisdom teeth X-rays and knee joints MRT are taken, followed by dentists and radiologicals, have been criticised in some districts.
One of the sceptics is the University of Karolinska’s suicideologist Claude Marcus, whose tasks include an assessment of human biological maturity in order to determine whether they passed through puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we can't say for certain, then we shouldn't make a face that we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
But Johan Göransson, the Institute of Medical Medicine, protected the accuracy of the tests: "It is generally possible to say that the risk of disintegration of the child to an incompletely adult is low.
At about 10%, the greatest risk is when a person is a little less than 18."

The 20-year-old hammer-thrower Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut on London's MM, making a good 18th place with 67.37.
Orel was MM's youngest female thief and a happy woman confirmed that she was hoping to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and I got a good experience.
In the first test (64.80), I immediately scored my average result, the second (62.80) I risked too much and the third (67.37) managed to keep my head clear," said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
The debut of Ms Maria Orel M.M. ended with a good 18th place.
The rainy Orel didn't bother you because he's training in winter through the H.R. stadium.
"I'm scared," he said with a little baby.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel realize people around or could turn themselves off?
I get it, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it's worth it - that's it.
If you compete yourself, you can experience it.
The Orel confirmed that M.M.'s debut will be in peace and he's still having a lot of good competitions: "I've come here with the 32nd of this season, or the final result, I've finished on 18th.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and the MM-- that's the only thing that matters.
I take a good experience, and one day I want to fight for medals.
Lääne-Vigina Governor announced that the party exchange had been announced by the President of West Virginia.
From West Virginia's democrat Governor Jim Justice announced at Thursday evening meeting with President Trump that he would exchange parties.
"I like it or not, but the democracies walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today, I say to you, having been praying a lot and thinking about... today I say to you, the Western Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the meeting, the glad ones opened up.
"It'll be a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"Treenerina, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a great deal of notice at the meeting in West Virginia earlier.
Trump won at 42 points in West Virginia, and Justice did not support the candidate for the Democrats from Hillary Clinton.
The only billionaire of the state according to Forbes was selected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and he owns coal mines from his father.
His value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the National Committee of Republics (CNC) announced on Thursday evening that "The Party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from making it better than working for it".
"From the 15 governors and control of the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of parties that are at the end of the party, and cannot find a positive and connecting message," said RNC premier Ronna McDaniel in the declaration to CBS News.

Coe approved the Russians' sincere apology for the doping scandal.
Sebastian Coe, an international tyrant of light power, said his words "Veneland's Thursday's honest sorry" for the doping scandal, but repeated that it is not time to allow the country's sport back.
Dmitry Shylakthin, a Russian tyrant, said at the IAAF Congress on the night of World Championships, that his country's competitive ban is correct and has a solid aim to combat doping.
He apologized to "all the light-powerds from whom the gold medals and silver medals have been taken off in the competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the competitive ban imposed in November 2015 after the WADA report found evidence of state supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, with a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the journalist.
"The good Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation also acknowledged themselves that they had had had quite a complicated time and were doing everything possible to reorganise the alliance."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted its own promotion criteria.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but the Congress supports the working group's proposal that it is not the time to take Russia back," said Coe.
"We must do everything possible within the next few months to normalize the situation.
We have always been based on the principle that we want to separate clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen of Russia's light-cores, who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete as neutral athletes in World Championships in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia is not yet in compliance with a number of criteria for renewal.
Following a presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the doping check was still insufficient and that trainers who had been banned are still operating freely.
The car revolution significantly changes the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
It also creates new winners and losers on the metal market, not least because the revolution of electric cars significantly changes everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure.
Although mines like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place to another, smaller mining companies don't help.
Glencore is currently serving from coal and oil, but subsequently in the era of electric cars, the demand for copper, aluminium and nickel is growing.
This year, decisions by the UK, France and the Norwegian governments on the distribution of electric cars have increased their contribution in order to allow them to ban the sale of new cars using fossil fuels in the coming decades.
I guess Volvo already told me that they were planning to quit their internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper model 3 electric car on the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that more electric cars than oil-fired vehicles will be sold over a period of two decades.
"For some metals, this changes everything," said Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambrani to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a great impact on metals such as caves and lithium, whose demand has grown for years.
The electric cars have about three times more copper than the normal car, called Glencore.
More copper is needed at loading stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by 2025 by about five percent.
The increase in demand for batteries for electric cars means additional lithium, cobalt, graphics and manganese demand.
Glencore's rising trend in electric cars comes from a copper price increase and from the fact that he is the world's largest cobalt producer, predicted by Jefferies Group.
According to this broker company, Freeport-McMoRaan and First Quantum Minerals are the winners of the race for electric cars.
The market reacts to the changing trend.
In this year, 70 per cent of the cave has grown from the London Stock Exchange.
The current price increase was 37 per cent.
Copper has also grown by 14 per cent this year, mainly due to growth.
Glencore's share in London rose by 20 per cent, being over-priced by the Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billitoni and Anglo America.
On the part of the losers there are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, who have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of the vehicle is the start-up batteries for petrol and diesel-engined cars with power supply.
Cars use lithium batteries.
"This is a serious risk to the demand for lead unless it is found to be of other purpose that can exceed the decrease in demand," said Michael Widmer, the metal market analyst of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said.
In the form of the price movement of the lye, the effect of the decompressed trend is not yet noticeable.
Pili has grown by 17 per cent this year, which is the best metal in London among the main industrial metals in price increases.
Investors will see problems with metal only far from over the future.
"I'm not sure the lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps regular cars in competition," said Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt, the metal broker company.
If the demand for lead falls, this will happen slowly.
Maybe it'll happen in about ten years.
To date, however, stricter exhaust standards mean that demand for hybrid cars is growing, dependent on advanced lead-based batteries that have developed regularly when starting engines, an international lead and zinc research organisation will be evaluated.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel as a lighter car can drive further away with less electricity.
This explains already the additional amount of aluminium aluminium demand of 1.6 million tonnes until 2013-2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the total world production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to get worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has grown by 13 per cent this year, as growing demand by car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
The steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding works with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce wonderful motors.
Also ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist aluminium.
"The high steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribisi analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There are some successes in Europe.
The end of the oil season can also bring suffering to the plate.
About half of this precious metal used to be catalysts for diesel-engine cars, called the metal refiner Johnson Matthias.
"At present there may be no great demand for high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum in the future", said Natix's raw material analyst Bernard Dahh.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
The panel manufacturers believe in continuing demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore's leader, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric cars.
In the 10 years term, there is a great hope for the producers of platinum for the development of hydrogen-based cars from the Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, until then, this technology has still not justified itself in business terms.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Pariba to Brunet.
In July, German car manufacturers became part of the great setback since the Stuttgart Court banned the use of diesel in the hometown of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris.
The rules aimed at preventing unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from moving from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona French club in Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences of UEFA, the management body that rules the European game and which is in the power to prohibit teams from participating in the Prestižel Master League tournament, will be waiting for Paris Saint-Germain to take part in the tournament.
The financial rules for a fair game (FFP) established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transition was financed without enormous losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million ($262 million) solely for the purchase of brasiillas from its contract, and Neymar's salary will be up to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of moving to the club in Neymar France.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to recruit Neymar and add such money to its starlike rivalry, given that the team is financed by the family in charge of Kata's energy crime.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with their football players.
The FFP was founded on Michel Platin after he was elected President of the UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that, in the search for success in large debt, actually engaged in fraud and risk destruction if banks or owners were to give up their support.
Since 2011, the FF club debt will focus on monitoring these losses instead of monitoring their debts.
This change means that the business model Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea's - to buy a potential club and then make large expenses to make the team better and create a global brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which runs until 2018, clubs may suffer losses of up to EUR 30 million.
Despite the disgraceful rejection of the President’s Office in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cerer, still committed himself to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said The Associated Presse Andrea Traverso, who is a UEFA in FFP reviewer.
Although PSG paid for the Neymar acquisition clause as a single full payment, it is possible for them to allocate this amount for the purpose of accounting purposes into parts throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, so it is possible to show the transitional fee in the next five years in the form of a sum of EUR 44,4 million in the next five years.
In 2014, in the case of the first wave of the FFP sanctions, the PSG, together with the most severe punishments on Manchester City belonging to Abu Dhab, became the most severe penalty.
The PSG was granted a fine of EUR 60 million (at this time, USD 82 million) which was reduced later to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the League of Masters in 2014-2015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to over-prove regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies related to club owners.
While the company may sponsor PSGs, if the value of sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support value was blown up.
It has been said that a certain part of Neymar PSG’s service can come from Qatar through payments from the 2022 World Championship Management Committee.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a world champion of championships and argue that UEFA regulators would be able to easily reveal such a maneuver.
The penalties imposed on the PSG earlier mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
On Thursday, the people who were familiar with the situation said that UEFA had not previously discussed the transition with PSG Neymar in advance.
They talked to The Associated Press on condition that they are guaranteed anonymousness because they are not allowed to discuss the situation with the PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros in the 2015-2016 season profit at around EUR 542.4 million of turnover.
The data for the previous financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will have a good effect on sponsorship transactions, trade and the sale of shirts.
The club expects at least 30 percent increase in turnover in connection with the conclusion of the contract.
Spain too, being clearly upset about leaving one of the biggest football players, tried to prevent Neymar's transition, claiming that PSG would break the FFP with it.
"This is a clear case of money doping with a club and a state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas in Spain's newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG mainly belongs to Qatar.
Arsenal's pineist Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnaad, shares La Liga's attitude that the state is financing the club.
"This is the consequence of property rights, and it has changed completely throughout the football station over the past 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to a country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of a fair game, as the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large player country."
Norwegian low-cost airline Norwegian is a nice tradition to put on aircraft cruise pictures of those who have shifted borders in their area and have been inspired by others, writes trip.ee
In addition to the expansion of Norwegian action photography, the circle of people who have earned a place on the plane has also expanded.
Among the selected zones are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (see picture) and Miguel de Cervantes, for example.
In the near future, however, one plane is about to be decorated by Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury's portrait.
50 years ago: The storm of the orange dimension in Estonia, which tears out roofs and windows from the houses.
A century's storm called an orcan that was causing major damage to the West, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular on 6 and 7 August.
In North-West Estonia, during these days the wind speed was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran into another tree in the garden and touched his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and dark, like the end of the world.
In 2002, Linda Kurova Haapsalus reported Estonia's nature interview.
Linda's husband saw her garden collapse.
But what are you gonna do with the hands of the trees where you can pick up a storm like this?
The sea came down the window, from the windows to the water," said Mrs Linda Linda, who lived on the street in Haapsalus Kalda.
That the roads were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalus as well as the next morning.
According to the locals, the trees behind Paralepa were created in the ground, some completely down, a few sides.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through war from beautiful old trees.
Lääne-Virumaa was unable to suffer very much from the August 1967 storm compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was great there, wrote Virumaa's Journal in 2007.
The Haapsalu Losspark and Padis park were wiped out from the ground soil, but also our deck blocks could suffer hard.
In Tallinn, the wind speed was measured to a maximum of 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
In Tallinn Seafield at the night of August 6th, one little girl called, "Mom, Mom."
Chickens are in the air and can no longer be down!", wrote Virumaa Journal.
The building of the Pärll Manor on the land was destroyed during the storm so far that it was decided to disintegrate later.
The Augusttor was not able to withstand Turi's oral hypnotic structures, which were not later restored.
The Red Letter wrote on 12 August 1967 that the cleaning up of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches would progress slowly, and the inhabitants would be able to join in the cleaning work.
The storm also suffered crop fields, and the newspaper reported that "the organisations of the local community must be both in order and in order to encourage and guide crop harvests".
Orcans can be discussed if the average wind speed exceeds 32,7 m/s.
The record of the clean wind in Estonia will remain from 2 November 1969 when Ruhnul was measured as the speed of wind 48 m/s.
On the island of the altar, the meter was broken, so the speed of the high wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean bathing: Night cleaning and poor beach view.
The colder summer worlds also mean a smaller harvest in Tallinn baths.
"If it's air, then people are on the beach, and if it isn't, there aren't any people," says the beach cleaninger.
On the shores of the North-Tallinna Zoom, kayaks are screaming.
They will be offered a tractor with a melodic competition on low wheels, which will turn down the strips on the patch.
In fact, the last seven centimetres of sand is actually rowing through the sand, picking out the sea bream and the larvae left behind: bottle caps, cigarettes and so on.
People are still coming to the beach, whether water is warm or not.
If it is a beautiful weather, then people are on the beach, and if there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, Head of the beach cleaning work of Haabersti Administrative Department.
It is 6:30 p.m. and the beach is busy cleaning work, as at 8:00 p.m., the place must be in order for people to be in order.
Usov's on duty since four o'clock.
She still has eyes on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and the Pikakar beach of the island of Paljasaari.
The amount of waste has been reduced.
A few years ago, it was much more than that.
People can already appreciate what they're doing for them," says Usov, who's been cleaning up a beach for 15 years.
It was before that when something new came up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean beach price
More and more works on the shores of Estonia have been done by cleaning up the sea waste or adru.
For example, on the shore of Pirita, this beach season will require 400 000 tonnes to be carried away.
"This is an incredible amount," notes Usov.
The second large category is the domestic waste, that is, all the people leave behind.
There are eight large landfills in the kilometres of chrom's coastal strip, which are required to be empty three times a week.
That's how much garbage is produced.
However, the colder summer worlds have meant that the waste is five times less than otherwise.
The third species will form the abandoned items.
Most of the time, these are children's lives.
As a result, Usov's sand has got a quarter of the model car out of the inside of the sand.
They will remain waiting for the owners to have a frame on the beach line.
Umov already knows that he'll find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
The waste will be split apart.
Erika Scholler, a representative of Habersti's administrative services, admits that locals are disrupting the operation of the tractor’s screening operations.
The noise that lasts from night to morning interferes with the sleep of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, this job is impossible, but it's impossible.
One month, you have to go through sex twice a day.
"If we don't do this, the town's gonna fine us," says Scholler.
However, the objective is to get a chrome beach under the international bluewood quality mark as well as Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu.
"In addition to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," Scholler says.
We have more food and stones and harder to eat sand.
But on our shores there are fewer waste than in other parts of Europe.
After hearing that the garbage is being spoken about on the beach, Martin, living near the beach, is forced to enter a discussion of journalist and cleaning workers, highlighting the current bottlenecks of the beach.
There's a disgusting picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle-scrapers who have pulled garbage bags off the cap," says Martin.
Although it is difficult to expect people to change their behaviours so far, Martin hopes that the city government will do something about garbage cans and put them on covers, for example, to prevent at least birds from renewing there.
In general, however, Martin is pleased with the development of the beach.
See how the city takes care of it.
With children's fields, enlightened and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
Once upon a time, the roller bearings could only drive one way," notes Martin.
The bread of Aardechüct in chromis: coins, coins only, coins.
A 40-year-old Dimitri, 40-year-old in the morning, has come to take advantage of the morning swords, who, as a treasure cap, combs the beach floor with a metal detector.
He doesn't think that today, nor in the future, will he.
The sea gods are not generous enough for that.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything valuable yet," says Dmitri.
As a Hobiard cake, some euro coins, bottle caps, and also dangerous nails that will be thrown into the trash can later be found in the hobiaard cake.
Usually there are coins.
"There's no gold, no rings, no other kind of thing," says the treasure hat.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25% at 0.25%.
It is expected from the Bank of England that interest rates will remain at the same level as in forceless economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have reduced speculation in relation to the rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to grow, as household-restricted incomes have put interest rates on the ground.
Policymakers of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of maintaining the 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members require an increase in this month, as slow growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 by 1.7% after the growth forecast and by 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the pressure on households' incomes remained, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also pointed out that the increase in rates is necessary to control inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that there may be a need for higher than expected credit costs on the financial markets.
The members also voted a year ago in favour of partial withdrawal of the Mammoth Package, which markets the economy as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will complete a fixed-term financing scheme offering banks cheap financing, although it said that it is now expected to be worth GBP 15 billion more than GBP 115 billion under this scheme.
In the Protocols to the decision imposed, the bank says: "In the mid-term forecast of theMPC, gross domestic product (GDP) will become obsolete in the near future, as the difficult situation of real households' incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
It was reiterated that a "lower effort" on monetary policy is necessary to mitigate inflation and is "a little higher" than expected on the markets.
The exchange is currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of the following year and the second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all the jumps are gradual and limited.
The bank's reduced growth projections for this year and next year are comparable to the May projections of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for the annual growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained stable.
After this news, the pound of the dollar and the euro went down.
GBP dropped to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent growth indicators, which have summed up the growing expectations of the rise in GDP in the second quarter from 0.2% in the last three months to 0.3% in the previous three months.
The Bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will begin to build up a little bit of momentum.
The latest inflation report of the Bank gave little cause to rejoice for rising inflation and poor wage increases in households, saying that the situation will get a little worse before it recovers.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a blow to income in the next few years, but a marked wage recovery is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to weak pounds, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partially offsets lower consumer costs.
The decision will take place one year after the dates were brought to a level of 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the nail.
According to the Bank, it is likely that four years will be necessary to fully absorb life into prices and the economy.
Before the final decision by the bank was to feel growing demand for the increase in the rate, since inflation had increased the pressure on households in distress; in July three policy makers called for a 0.5% increase in the rate.
The inflation fell by 2.6% over the previous month compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank’s message was expected and the next few months are due to rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth relative to the 2-percent target was caused by a completely weak female.
Coreco's head of mortgage brokers, Andrew Montlake, said: "With regard to the recent decline in rates, it seems that the mortgage market will become more and more competitive, as creditors want to work and hope to complete the year with a positive outcome.
The exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are going to be completed, since refinancing, often at a service fee and a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing about 10 000 people who are in conflict with HIV medicines that have caused HIV.
Patients have since September access to "transformative" HIV for preventive treatment following a battle at the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health is now estimated to make 10 000 people available pre-exposure (PrEP) tablets at an initial three-year clinical trial and that have shown a decrease in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk people.
NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the Board of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court of the previous year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority’s own claims that the medicine should be financed by the local authorities rather than by the local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this movement published on Thursday as a "new large-scale intervention", while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as "a turning point".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to be registered for people. October also adds clinics before the program is introduced everywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure Prevention (PrEP) is an HIV course that is taken before the relationship to reduce the risk of infection to HIV.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV among people at risk of infection.
Before taking a PEP, it means that a person's body has enough medicines to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicinal products may be taken daily, or at the latest two hours before the interval.
Appropriate candidates include gay or bisexual men, transsexual people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated for treatment.
The clinical trials will identify appropriate individuals who are willing to take part in a clinical trial, including men, women, transsexual people and those who are not receiving antiretroviral treatment by an HIV-infected partner.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their participation in the local sexual health clinic participating in the program.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to obtain medicines this week after the international procurement procedure.
The aim of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended for and how it is consumed and implemented in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new large-scale intervention should complement and boost the wide-ranging and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, acting director of NAT, said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
Mrs. PrEP, if properly targeted for those who need it and belong to a risk group, will offer an opportunity to change England's HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people with high HIV risk have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and does not depend on negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives through a clinical trial funded by this NHS.
We welcome this announcement warmly."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: "Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial across the country is quickly delayed and that no member of the HIV risk group would miss out.
Now that PEP has been obtained with a clinical trial medicine, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of being infected with HIV.
Sharon Hodgson, the Vice Minister of Public Health, said: "The beginning of the clinical trial of the ProEP is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the drag of the government's feet.
Evidence shows how much changes this medicine can bring about in order to stop HIV prevention and end its life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us a step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PEP.
It is now important that a clinical trial is taken across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV, and to take us a step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased in Estonia by 12%, while in Latvia and Lithuania decreased by 12%.
In July, the difference between the next day’s electricity exchange price between Estonia and the prices of Latvia and Lithuania decreased to EUR 1,94 compared to EUR 7,71 in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for this difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Sweden community.
In Estonia, the average exchange price for electricity grew by EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June last month.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price decreased by five percentage points to EUR 36,27 per megawatt-hours.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price for Nord Pool was equal to EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 per cent, respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, 75 per cent of the hours last month moved from Estonia to Estonia and 16 per cent from the hours in Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine per cent of the hours between the two countries did not make any transactions for the next day.
The electricity flow between Estonia and Latvia was 99 per cent from Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of hours were in use for total transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, in August the stock price of electricity can be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per mega-hour in September.
The CO2 price impacting the electricity production price rose last month and transactions took place at 5,04-5,47 EUR/tonne.
Higher living - half floor and smart design designers have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a room for a home in the little home of Earls Court's apartment.
Joanne Jingh, an ex-banker who is a passionate real estate developer, exchanged his great Knightsbridge home for Earls Court's apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to a new design.
"For the first time, I lived on a much larger surface with my ex-partner at Knightsbridge," Joanne said.
"I bought something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had similar high rates.
I fell in love with it and made an offer on the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-ruthometer apartment has completed a complete innovation course.
At first it was an apartment with a single bedroom and a complex layout - a bedroom had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to take advantage of high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
They were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi Noting Hill from Duck & Shed, an architect and design studio, to use 3.8 m high ceilings and to create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-store where you could stand up.
Erfan had to get creatively close to it.
"Metal design is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganize the rooms so that they would be placed on each other without having to bend over.
It was not just about building a platform, but using a steel structure, so that both the upper and lower space would be right."
This regulation enabled Erfan to create two rooms of full height in one room with plenty of dramatic elements.
Downstairs the old left light opens into the glamorous living room under the view of the Retrouvius window.
The golden furniture, silver details and retro-sparking Serge Mouille's light highlight the style of space.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding to the teattariness, space and lightness.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor are attached to it so that it may look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror makes the back wall look like an open window in the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cup offers a safe deposit for all Joanne's dining instruments and glassware.
The living room has a charming opportunity to close the kitchen, if not used, creating a more glamorous space of imagination.
The consumable kitchens are nothing new.
However, at this kitchen there is a unique fact that this is a garage-type lift-up door.
"It took a little for design," explains Erfan's steel-backed spyed MDF door.
"It has a counterbalance, which is why it slides very easily if it is pushed up."
With the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra bedrooms, additional bedrooms and a better housing plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor area is what you sell, or what gives property value," says Erfan.
"The Kinnisvarmaaker enters the room in an obsolete form and makes calculations based on the surface of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor surface by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help to cause emotional ties with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric chair in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart scream."
This shows that good design and increased area will help to do something amazing about a relatively common apartment.
In fact, they may even make a wish not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a Chicago cloud-eater hunter who will compete with his colleague for a promotion.
It doesn't matter if it's just the amount of money that you've earned, which you'll forget about all kinds of ethics.
His wife and three children only see a man early in the morning and late at night.
In the first half of the film, I think it's like Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech machine.
As the movie goes, the less the framehouse element remains, and the moralizing intention of filmmakers is becoming increasingly apparent.
A life-changing experience can result in cancer in the patient’s son’s illness.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
The dreamy son of the architect's office makes his father think about real important things, such as faith, goodness, love... on walking trips to the great buildings in Chicago, without even touching the disaster of the twins.
After the third scene where the son opens his eyes, it becomes felt that filmmakers have come from the goal of getting the audience to cry, because even a viewer with the most severe heart can't keep their tears back in view of the suffering of a dear cancerful boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his condition seems hopeless, his father finally understands the morality of his work and does good work for an old man seeking good works.
Now I'm gonna bet on myself - if the film has a happy ending, then I'm going to be a little bit more than a movie of coffee after I'm wrong, but if I'm wrong, then I'm going to be happy for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a doubt that I'll be left out of coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he's slowing down towards the hall.
However, the Son is wonderfully well balanced, and even though his father has just lost his job, it turns out to be positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel well too - I can already predict the end of the American drama.
With the honor of the truth, the film is well designed, all the elements necessary for it are available.
Can cry, can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure that'll make this movie good for you.
The Trump's new staff chief is planning to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really handle it.
Then he'd be first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information, including news, to President Trump, to hope that it will keep the superior levelling in water.
Here's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior officials on his first working day, he identified a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he was planning to solve for bad information in the President's hands.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis seems quite logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to track Trump's media usage.
President Trump's relationship with television goes behind for decades, and now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have not disappeared anywhere.
"If the candidate Trump was angry about the unfair media coverage, he was paid to show that he was also reflected in the impressive publications, honestly," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February to Politico.
Politico Tara Palmer, at that time, wrote that "six former campaign workers say that the key to managing Trump Twitter's habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption is stablely included also in a chip song".
Okay.
The idea that the habits of using Trump Twitter have ever been "controld" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's tunes would have been even more delicious without their intervention.
We're probably never gonna find out about the noises that Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble a couple of times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one's been able to stop Trump from consistently creating nothing.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, people are merely trying to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
In May, Politico wrote to the President advice on the tendency to feed information of strategically questionable value to the President.
For example, what is described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"Pragues and former Trump subordinates say that Trump can react to negative press, in particular to harmful information leaks, explosively, by obstinately identifying their source of source.
This was the case at the end of February when someone gave a copy of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson's article of GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walshi, of being the source of the White House's multiple information articles.
It doesn't matter if Johnson's been permanently blocked off Twitter because of his abuse, or if he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or if he's also filed and withdrawn false charges in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking about Walshi the subordinates."
Goldmacher added that the modern staff chief Reince Priebus and Head of the White House Office Rob Porter " have tried to establish a system for managing and documenting documents that reach Trump".
How did it work out?
Kelly's gonna try to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still fighting for the effect.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians coming from a foreign capital city do not get permission to perform bitterly.
In the centre of Tallinn, there is a lot of foreign music playing abroad.
The people who got the evening story admitted they were playing in the old town without the city government's permission.
The first thing we did was find three street musicians near Viru's gates who had the same number of dogs with them.
It was clearly apparent that musicians with strips and broken clothes were back-bag travelers who could use a shower to make up.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the company played a story with a fun rhythm, while one man next to him played a three-ball juggler and called the passersby closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one of the backpacks and smoked the heart rate himself a fucked-up bitch.
The three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the passing people.
Bob, who played with Noem and the balls at the convention, said that music on the streets about fun and money.
The purpose of the society’s performance was to collect ticket money on board a vessel flying to Finland on the same day on the same night.
The question is, did they ask the city permission to be a Musketeer in the old town, they scratched Noemi and Bob's head.
First, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city more than a day or a couple, and most of the time, we will be allowed for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for this," explains Bob.
When we got back to Viru about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were at the musicians and they drove them away.
The association moved with the backpacks and dogs to the crossroads of Viru Centre to see good luck.
There were also three half young men on the river, one of whom played violin, the other clarinet, and the third had already carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to provide people with entertainment in order to spread music and pleasure and to make money for fuel and living," explained Trio pianist Milosh.
According to Movoshi, they are aware of the fact that the city government must have permission to be present.
"Well, we don't have it," he said in a joke.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there is no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we're going somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased loans for EUR 149 million for the public reserve purchase programme of the euro area central bank, the central bank bond portfolio increased to EUR 4.36 billion.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information on the purchases.
The President of Eesti Pank Hardo Hansson, in response to the discussion of members of the Riigikogu, explained that the Eurosystem central bank’s asset purchase plan includes three different purchasing programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The bank buys bonds from the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
The effects of the purchases result in a lower risk asset return, which motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, each central bank will buy its government bonds under a public bond purchase programme, and other sovereign bonds will not be bought.
As Estonia has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
Replacements are also made by central banks in those countries where the offer of bonds according to the purchase plan is limited.
Eesti Pank, following Hansson’s approval, usually buys European institutions’ bonds, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank’s bonds.
Eesti Pank will buy bonds under the early purchase programme from March 2015 onwards.
In the meantime, Elering’s bonds were also acquired, but Eesti Pank no longer buys Elering’s bonds from June 2016 onwards.
In the name of the euro area central banks, both Elering and Eesti Energia’s bonds will be purchased by the Finnish Central Bank from June.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to "millionaire districts"
Some of the most wealthy domestic owners in West Midtown have once again faced a fierce conflict with determined travelers who have ignored the dug-up ditch of the council in order to win back the field away from their wools.
Travelers have parked their 20 trailer suites in the field of a wealthy 'millionaire district' in the vicinity of Solihull street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks after they were kicked out of the corn, not to let themselves get mixed up in a basket that the council was digging to stop their invasion of the council.
A tactical group found a weak spot protected by stifling their vehicles from the remaining part that had been left on the road.
Maruvi-like residents are acclaimed by the Solihull Council, saying that the council is "no good in dealing with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after they threw out Bentley Heath, where they threw the passings with stones.
The Council must be ashamed that they will act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were gone on time, and now they're back again.
They were here last night, probably more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to the protection of its parks.
I live on the way to Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy that I have to continue to pay the council's fee if the council can't even stop such a thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said, "This is ridiculous. We only saw how the last of these travelers left, and there is already a new attack.
This time the number has grown, and in the grassland there is even a horse that has been seen as being commemorated."
The representative of the Council of Solihull said: "We are aware that in the country near the Streetsbrook road there is an unacceptable camp site and we work with the Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It will be very helpful to collect evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture for the court when we present the case to them."
Mr. Indrek Saar, among others, is also visiting the Weeend Festival, who is pleased to have the ability to bring true world top names to Estonia.
The question why Weekend is so important for Estonians is, Saar, that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival for three days in full parallel.
But he realizes that the real people in Pärnu have arrived.
"Looking at the level of the artists that has been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute peaks of this music genre are being brought home home - this is often not happening in our area," says the Minister for Culture.
What festival, however, do the artists most speak of the artist themselves?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, I'm sure one of the most experienced artists in Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his record, all of us have, at some point, turned on their own," he says.
However, he will bring out a number of names, such as Chansmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, we also have our Estonian authors: starting with NO -P and they can be read as a whole.
In fact, this well-known concentration of names is very large," he says.

Updates the reviews of car manufacturers in the middle of a crisis up to 850 000 diesel vehicles.
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers a software extension for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the BMW president, the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the home city of BMW Munich, which has considered the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would update three million vehicles from Mercedes in Europe to reduce emissions from diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as a call for back.
European car manufacturers have been eager to promote the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States of America to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitrogen oxides from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
Furthermore, the cost of the equipment to be installed to neutralise exhaust emissions from diesel for automotive companies will increase by making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the Union Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is also accused of ignoring the signs that the powerful car manufacturers are treating and referring to the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors, which silenced the use of so-called disappointment devices, which allowed the indication of exhaust emissions to comply with the regulations of the vehicle during the test period, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several leaders of Volkswagen have been accused in the United States of America and others are on both sides of the Atlantic investigation.
Last month, in Germany, the former Head of the Regional Economics Division of the Audit Engine Development Department was arrested in the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs.
Former President, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from issuing and may be brought to justice in the United States of America.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation in Volkswagen in Germany, when the authorities accused Audit of installing the system to get away from the requirements of European emissions emissions, thereby extending an investigation that had previously focused on the United States of America.
The inclusion in the audit may be a major boost to Volkswagen by the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
For 20 000 euros, schools in Estonia will receive the European Union tickets.
By 1 September, the Ministry of Education intends to buy the tickets of the European Union to mark the Presidency.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of the European Union flag 570 educational institutions.
The flags are intended for expression in indoor spaces, they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment in interiors also with a tunnel attachment, mediated by the ERR news portal.
The flagvarda label reads: "The gift to Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 for the Ministry of Education, one ticket costs EUR 35.
The journalist's murder in Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico, is where the magazine's murder murder is called a magazine''
The employees of Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinalo, which is sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and endless drug wars.
But today they are gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They say it's important to change your routine.
Two parents’ books are discussing which seems safer: either bringing children into an office that was the target of the grenade attack in 2009 or leaving them home.
Security experts have written three words on the front panel of the room: "Women", "Neutral", "Allies".
They ask reporters to each column your names to provide proof is not necessary, enough impressions and interiors.
Being hired by government or cartels is suspected of being a whole list of evils who make it dangerous to reflect chaos in Mexico.
There is no sign of violence and the more bodies of the country are congested, the majority of them are, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, since they have been taken up by President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 at least 25,589 journalists have since attacks and threats under national protection, and over this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The last deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, Riodoce's associate Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The main mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His absence is profoundly felt, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the fascist of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez showing the middle finger with the letter "Justice" and two 30s reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear a T-shirt with his smiled glasses face or a typical flat hat for him.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. The reporters will discuss a common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor’s Office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, only two cases have been brought to legal responsibility in the data of the Committee for the Protection of Journals.
As in the case of most annual cases of drug trafficking and organised crime, with a number of thousands of murders, journalists rarely get to court before their killers.
The work of Riodoc continues to reflect violence in Sinalo, although their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the information and justice of the killers, Ibarra said that much of the benefits of the security meeting Ibarra said were of great importance.
"It's pretty stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left Riodoce's office in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on 15 May in the morning.
He was only able to drive a few blocks before two men stopped him from red Toyota Corola, and he was forced to get out of the car 12 times, which is expected to be because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated into "the twelve rivers".
The armed man drove Valdez out of the car and made an accident nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left behind by a woman and two grown-up children.
The rumors are spread freely in Culiacan.
However, on the subject of Valdez, there is more than a silence in particular.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the United States of America in January, Sinalo has been one of the most bloody battlefields in the country since the rivalries are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
No matter how many people or even more people are shot on the streets of Sinaloa every day, or that the morgue is full of decorated double drug kings, which are bigger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the time of peace refers to the fact that only one cartel is headed by valuable ports and the U.S. drug route to the United States of America.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoc's sponsor and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60) is familiar with the enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that killing was a favour of two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a competing and military cartel with the sons of Guzman.
This book may have hated the sons by the suspected gang members bought all copies of the edition as soon as they arrived at the newspaper rosters.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own security after a branch took place in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and killing him is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues expected him to be there forever.
In 2003, he worked at Noroeste as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50 dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloas "was impossible for the press to deal with a drug problem without touching a drug problem."
In time, the newspaper gathered its feeling of bold and honest reflections, and sales and advertising increased.
The reporters liked to publish powerful studies without fear of censorship and readers in a snowy edition of which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, the newspaper won its Latin America-recording award for the prestiizese Maria Moors Cabo Prize.
In the same year, Valdez’s Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Press Freedom Prize for its courage to follow Mexico’s Narcotics anywhere it leads to.
He openly admitted he was afraid.
"I'm going to live on," he said after receiving the AKK Prize.
Last October he said to the TV channel Rompeviito TV about the interview that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinalo.
"You have to take on the task of playing fools with the press agency.
I don't want to be asked what I did when I faced so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce collective misses Valdez, a joker who was rocking like a madman, a friend who kindly shared embbus and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from office to a place across the way to El Guayabo's bar and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love was fatal to him.
His death has made them wonder how to do their job best and survive.
"They don't like being a rabbit for these women, their children, their legitimate business, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things should not be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is even at the best of times strong self - control and self - control.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay back.
According to Riodo editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that Sinalo does not apply to old rules, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipasis, Veracruz, Guerreros or other States that are home to the toxic composition of profitable mutilation routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The room where Riodoce's employees were gathered for safety training was suddenly no longer allowed for mobile phones; a few days before that it was revealed that only the spy assets sold to governments were used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were looking for a relief from 40 degrees of heat in the shadow of a tree.
The government appointed them to guard Riodoce's office, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered if these police officers were among the 50 percent police officers whose governor himself has made it untrustable.
Several months have passed since the reporters have gone to mountain areas where control is in de facto drug gangs.
The Riodoc this week's publication discussed three main issues:
One of them was the murder of Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinalo.
In addition, they had a remarkable story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a quarter away from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew about the restaurant was a place of pleasure for both drug dealers and authorities.
The reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician who belongs to the existing Institutional Revolutionary Industries (IRP), which dominated all political planes almost throughout the previous century.
Recently, a number of IRP governors have been accused of corruption in the context of a wide range of cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of the former El Chapo carrier Guzman escaped from military records.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have been looking for the Valdez column to get information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have already known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose kleenuk body construction has served him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all the communication channels have been cut off with our sources."
The Valdez office has received storage for stamps and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and the workers in the service have received something they could never expect from the activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a couple of stills and headed to the local prosecutor's office next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the killing of Valdez in the western state of Michigan.
The body has been found burned and according to officials, it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more silent and criticised as an organised protest of the "SOS press" term "SOS press" for pedestrians and buildings.
On that day, President Bojorquez will be out in Washington, Washington, trying to collect international support to set up international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez died with the governor of Sinalo, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked for him to be assigned to reflect government activities elsewhere, worrying that anger has affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were 'limited' by organised crime, co-ysed civil servants and any society.
In his last book "Narko Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but that also happens under the orders of politicians and security forces, who are in the woods of organised crime.
Last year, Article 19 of the Media Regulatory Group, more than half of journalists' attacks on the police and public officials, attributed more than half of the last year to more than half of the journalists' attacks on the police and public officials.
"You will die because you are wanted to be silenced," said Ramirez.
The murders obviously affect the blood supply.
No one forgets about the death of a blog Mary Elizabeth Macias in Tamaulipaasis six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
His body was found with a letter which was probably signed by the cartel Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to his cut-off head.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border region of Chihuahua, after killing Miroslava Breach, in March.
Others will continue as they did in the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo for the murder of their President in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad spoke to Juarez’s drug cartel, a publicly pretext guide, entitled “What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home countries or even their country.
This is by decision of the nervous system.
It's hard to find work in Exiil, and they still have to hold the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes behind them, as was probably the case with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in 2015 in one Mexican apartment in Mexico for three months after he left Veracuz.
Those who remain and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, admits that reflecting a drug business scares him.
"Mexico is on her way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
One of the most recent nights when the latest number was already locked up, Riodoc's editors sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and bludged the beer when suddenly all of the phones started vibrating.
Nineteen people were killed on confirmed records of the fires between rival gangs and security forces in Mazatani, on the beach resort city in Mazatani.
The war continued to continue, as many of the messages left behind by cartels found in the region were also promised.
On the same side of the sideway, reporters put news on the Riodoc website using their mobile phone.
The front of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens were hovering around the area with another turn of fire.
Bojorquez pulsed to the police officers on guard to see if they were alert.
If they were scared, they did not show it at least.
The fallen founder of the newspaper’s massive portrait, on which his average finger is visible to all of Sinalo, delivered Riodoc’s staff in his tracks.
"How could you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets to repoprate?"
Dinosaurus used the protection color of the enemy to prevent enemy exposure.
At first glance, it seems like a shape, though rather scary.
Scientists have now published the first findings regarding the incredible presence of the nostril size found by the Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It's just so well preserved that it was even possible to detect that the skin covered with its skirts was red brown color and its past had been somewhat "burden".
In Current Biology's published report described the existence as "the best preserved Finnish dinosaur ever found" and as "a single best dinosaur of the world".
Fossil is a new type of nodosaurus, which lived in the middle of the Crete 110-112 million years ago.
This incredibly good survival of open scientists who describe it as "very significant".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this warm-coated vegetative is the best preserved type of fossil that has ever been found.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk found it when he mined the Suncor Millenium mines near Fort McMurray in northern Alberas Canada.
He caught something that didn't look at the surrounding stone, and decided to examine it further.
Found fossils were sent to the Royal Tyrelli Paleontology Museum.
The next six years were developed to dig the animal out of a land of 2500 pounds (1 100 kg) of land.
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to make public.
"When a little bit of eyelashes, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the leading author of Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrelli Museum, where the presence is exhibited.
"It's going to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs of the dinosaurs Mona Lisa."
While studying her skin, researchers found that this herbal meal, which is covered with shells and reminds me of a walking tank, probably seriously threatened meat-food dinosaurs.
This large-scale dinosaur used a red and white protective color to hide from predators, and applied a shadow technique called anti-pretension, which is also used by many animals today.
According to experts, this allowed dinosaurs to be better around and avoid hostiles, as the larger dinosaurs probably kept hunting him.
This family belonging to the 110 million-year-old nodosaurus family came to a new land for the first time and is now visited at the Royal Tyrelli Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied their existence and named it Borealope's markmichelli Museum, according to the laboratory Mark Mitchell, who belonged to a team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to detect the animal.
Thanks to the amazing maintenance of the seat, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the vessels on the body of the animal.
They discovered resistance - a method of protection that was common in the country of the animal, meaning that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although resistance is widespread, the inventions come as a surprise because Borealop is much bigger than animals living in resistance today.
It suggests that the dinosaurs were sufficiently active in the pursuit of other carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution preferred the shadow of survival instead of resistance.
However, most animals using modern resistance - e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, which suggests that nodosaurus had to really work to survive.
"The powerful hunting of a dinosaur covered with quite large and large armors shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of Cresian times may have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of salts organic compounds also revealed that dinosaur skin was red brown.
Scientists will continue to create a study to obtain clues about life, including the preserved content of this intestine, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into a surfing river, thus reaching the sea with a stream of current where he fell on the back of the front of the ocean floor.
At that time Albertas was as warm as currently in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread far further inland than now.
"This nodosaurus is truly significant because he is fully covered with a fully preserved warm skin, while he has also remained three-dimensional, retaining the original shape of the animal," said Brown.
"This means that the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretian era.
To rebuild it, you don't have to use a lot of imagination - it's just enough to kiss your eyes and it seems like she's sleeping."
The time was the time when the earth used to swim a huge number of carnivorous dinosaurs - theopods - moving on two legs.
Although all of their King Tyrnasaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealop, it could have been the Finnish dinosaur hunting for some of his scary predecessors.
These include Acrocantosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons of weighing monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology believe that Boealope was slain after the death of the sea and this mumfidelius mud.
On 21 March 2011, Shawn Funk discovered that he mined Millenium mines near Fort McMurray in northern Albertas Canada.
According to the museum, it is best preserved in the Finnish dinosaur world, including the skin and the skins, and it is complete from the conics to the hips.
These beings were on average 18 ft (five meters) long and weighing up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
From this shoulder, two 20 inches of valley were pulled out.
Scientists believe that this warm-coated plant-eater adventured through the current West Canada until the flooded river was threatened with its open field.
However, the place under the dinosaur was the place where it was buried helped to preserve its wishes in a very detailed way.
The rocked remains of this particular individual have been so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by the remains of the mugarous salts along the dinosaur’s skulls.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine: "This level of survival is as rare as horse butter.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
Stoned skin residues continue to cover the malignant stems on the skull of the animal.
The right front foot lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I have the opportunity to count the wishes on his farm."
How did one activist answer the question "Who the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a complete shock.
The day after traveling to New York, it was sitting in a room rental via St. Louis's resident Airbnb, on the phone with Facebook on the phone.
He got caught after his former schoolmate's post.
It says, "Police has just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still sitting on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information about his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Pidemega @TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly distributed in his timeline.
A rapper from St. Louis sent a real-time talk to Michael Brown about the death of an 18-year-old black man, who was killed by a white police officer in Missouris in Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street staying there for four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought about himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He hung up his phone, but later he saw again the evening that he saw the spark that this time reported the gathering of people on the Canfield Drive.
They shared photos of the police and screaming people and the man who claimed to be Brown's father and still kept a letter "The Fedurison police officer just killed my unarmed son!".
He watched a stream in real time, where a cop was standing in front of a group of protestors with a dead dog.
In the second video, another cop, he said, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "That's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder we're used to and what we could call typical."
I felt the nightmares at this point.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After he landed at 23 o'clock, he went to his father's place to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive the next morning for the two of them to Ferguson.
What took place with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "What Streets?" ("Who The Streets?"), which will be presented in cinemas on August 11th.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and commitment from the sight of those who lived in this community and who met the answers to the demands of the streets.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and had a suitable crown in her head, went to Ferguson, they had another conversation about what they had come up with before this morning, about the experiences and living conditions of black men and women.
"Do you remember when I taught you how to fight for your rights?" he reminds you of asking himself.
"We're driving to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," said Ferrell later.
"What is happening right now is... the angle that has happened in the past.
He must know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activation and organisation, and at the same time to feel different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we need to do in order to be free and free from ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him in such a way that he does not personally experience committed racism, he does not differ from another black girl.
I feel like I'd make her a potion if I protected her from this world."
The first stop they did when they arrived at Ferguson was on their way to South Florida - from the police station across the way, which had become a certain kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news of Officer Darren Wilson, who was never charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local business owner who made lunch meals.
They put together food bags and helped them share them with protestors.
For Ferrelli, it began slowly to take shape of a new type of activism.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, stating that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was President of the Minority Student Union and focused on food law and health-related inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It's all just lying."
A few days later, Ferrell met with a film director, Sabaah Folayan, at the time of the evening's demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted just to document what was going on.
"Are you trying to document what is happening or find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism was due to an innumerable number of cases where people - often white people - often come to the community and try to cut the benefits of this pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voice of people born and raised in Ferguson was not heard and that we wanted to do otherwise."
Folayan had already beaten his hands with Governor Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for activeism in connection with the convicted prisoners.
His involvement turned the project into a win-win project for Ferrelli and another six other locals who were filming "Whose Streets?" team, after he was shot at Brown for years, watched after he was shot at Brown.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people are represented, because they also represent me."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - he could show that the movement is not a "suspicious guide" but a community meeting, as Mr Folayan said - he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "What Streets?" is surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and getting married to his wife.
"I felt as if I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing for the first time when he saw the tapestry.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story highlights and reintroduces the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider movement of Black Lives Matter.
Two of the three beginners who thought about social media in 2012 after killing a black teenager, Trayvon Martin, out of the theme reference #BlackLivesMatter, is homosexual.
"In the leading role, black homosexual women have maintained the movement globally," said Ferrell, "and precisely because we have to fight on many fronts constantly.
Black women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, stating that "movement really keeps black women alive, and many of them are black homosexual women".
He also claims that "this is not a type of equal opportunity" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who blew the right energy," he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was right in the front line, because as a black homosexual woman, living in these nodes, there is a lot of weight at stake.
His energy can be detected through the screen."
At the same time, the news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial connections between the community and the police are still fragile.
During the demonstration to Ferrell, the conditional penalty for blocking the road will last for another 2,5 years.
He describes the social policy air-conditioning in the area he calls home, just "supervabohuhu".
However, he still considers the mantra that he has cast down a memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson all three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We don't have to lose anything except our chains."
7 Tips how to get over the top of the top of the Week's party after a week's party.
Some of the brightest male boys find themselves having a little bit of fun after that, that it's not bad, it's also helpful.
Or they may be based on the saying, "you can't hang on, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a good health thing.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today and tomorrow's Weekian Trall or other party - and get as painless as possible from the ground as possible?
Water.
Alcohol down and after, after a big party in the morning... or, if possible, instead of alcohol.
As the body loses a lot of liquid when drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
With water, mineral substances are also washed out of the body, and so is good drinking mineral water.
Since the stomach is often upset after a drink, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly gased.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure the hangover wouldn't have to go to Grandma's to break up the trees - it might be a fatal lie decision.
But a light walk helps the body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
A full-blowning and gnome-out is a more time-sustainable way to heal.
Give your body energy back easy and gently.
If you've been doing so well since you were drunk yesterday, you probably shouldn't try to load a large fat steak in your stomach.
Start with, for example, fresh juice containing fruit sugar in your body quietly to market your body.
If the health of the south is already affected, you could try, for example, a broccoli.
And a little bit later, butt.
Have a cup of coffee.
This diuretics will release your body from the last of the water.
As already said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a porridge at night, your liver will also have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose its performance.
So you're gonna ruin your liver even more and then there's going to be a lot worse in the ground.
In addition, pain does not last very long anyway in your body.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it'll upset you with all that dirty stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, you'll get along well with yourself.
It affects about the same way as walking, but walking does not get orgasm.
However, avoid being too active and crazy to pose - at a time of pop - a physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
A fool talk with time friends and fellows, make simple nonsense and laugh friendly about yourself and others (drivings).
A joke and a laugh may not make you laugh, but I'm sure it'll make you feel more amusing with them.
One day, it's over the top anyway.
Professor Northchester's professor and an employee of Oxford University at the University of Oxford are wanted as suspects in murder.
According to the police, the professor of Northchester University and the staff of Oxford University are being sought nationally, who have become suspects since the discovery of the dead body of men with deadly stab wounds in one of the Chicago luxury homes.
According to Cook County case documents, on Monday, no bail warrant was issued for arresting 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren, who was accused of murdering their alleged relationship with the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Dranleau.
According to the documentation, 26-year-old Cornell-Dranleau died after repeated stabilization.
According to the warning that the Chicago Police Department was released to the community, the body was discovered on 27 July.
The cops received a phone call and found a victim who had several stab wounds in his body when he arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment apartment.
According to the officials, Cornell-Dranleau was admitted to death at the scene, and investigators were considered to be a homicide while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked since 2007 as a co- professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Northchester.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Relations, said in a letter sent by e-mail that Lathem has now been temporarily withdrawn from work and has been prohibited from entering the cities of Northchester University.
"This is now the case with the competent authorities in the investigation, and the University of Northchester is working with researchers," said Cubbage.
Warren's a senior assistant in the financial department of Oxford University.
The representative of the University and the College of Somerville said in an e-booked statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and prepared to help the U.S."
In addition, the application stated that Mr Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give himself up.
Anthony Guglielelmi, head of the Chicago Police Department's Communication Department, strongly advises suspects to surrender themselves to the authorities.
"The courts have a sense where they are, but we deal with defining the exact location more intensively," said Guglimel.
According to Guglimelek, suspects will help the local, regional and national authorities to search for them.
Guglimel said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager who had just received a cryptic tip that there had been something going on in Apartment No 1008.
According to the police's description, this was a magical sight.
According to Guglield, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said that security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglimelmis.
Grand Plaza's management sent a letter to the population: "The company is currently working on research into the background of the events' chronology and the victim's background, and explores different motives, including the possibility that it was a family member."
start-up companies that help your company to avoid becoming Uber next to becoming Uber.
Amy Rétt wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at his e-commerce start-up company, but the polls were useless.
The responses were often vague, useless or, even worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, he did not trust some of the employees in this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Rõttt, who is headed by an e-commerce company sold by San Francisco hair care products from Madison Reed.
So he called for help from outside persons.
New type of human resource start-up companies are important to help companies find out how their employees feel.
In the development and licensing of software for measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide anonymity for workers and provide a hot line for complaints, and, in some cases, allow language artists to go past C level leaders and turn directly to the Bureau.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, associate and CEO Redwood City start-up company Glint, whose software analysts use companies to measure employee involvement.
According to the narrator, during the three years he has been using Glint, he has received a much better understanding of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to the sudden investigations and investigations into specific teams, it offers a company heat map, which provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must remain aware of their culture of employment in order not to turn into the next Uber, which has been repressed to scandals since the former employee published a blog mail that described the intimidating environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, an overview of the desire to have a profitable business opportunity is provided.
The global governance, regulation and compliance area may be worth more than USD 118,7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments data of the Financial Technology Statistics Website.
Denver Coloroos' start-up company Convert, which helps companies to prevent and identify inappropriate behaviour, observed this year in the light of Uber's suspicious reputation of interest and growth in activity.
The Converter has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a client.
Like Glinkki, the Convertcent companies will allow companies to send customized pulses, collect real-time confidential answers and view heat maps from problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous message link that allows workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, the complaints go directly to the Bureau.
"The public opinion has been taken by regulatory authorities," said the founder and CEO of the Convertcent, Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that, if an undertaking is found to treat its employees badly or to be unfairly treated, the company may face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, employee departures and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 sites, has spent more than a year ensuring that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the headquarters of the corporation.
If the employee had previously wanted to report the problem, he had to find a telephone number or email address at the headquarters of the Corporation, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was a often elusive and uncomfortable process, said James Vitrano, General Adviser of Ruby Tuesday, who said that there was no good way to monitor staff complaints.
However, now that the company uses the Convertcent, there are possible problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that did not previously reach leaders who worked in other cities or offices located in States, faster to identify and deal with them.
"I'm able to get closer to the holistic 360-wive experience of staff," said Vitrano, who is headed by Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Team.
"And we protect our shareholders from disputes with employees."
Quinlan said that companies started to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen fell into contact with Enron's scandal due to ethical violations.
But only when "social media became mature", companies realized that they could not prevent their black laundry from being washed publicly online.
"The use of this technology to monitor ethical behavior was used by people as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and a possibility that has the approval of venture capital investors who have been supported by both start-ups.
In February, the Convercent financed by $10 million companies such as Sawshire Ventures and Tola Capital, increasing the capital raised by it to the value of USD 47 million.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners in November, increasing the total financial contribution of the company to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if account is taken of the relationship between enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more than before from their workplaces.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the stakes on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy at the company, feel that they are listened and that the work they do is satisfactory, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President LinkedInis, who uses both Convertcent and Glinti, who are of general benefit and staff experience.
Investors earn income if the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow you to increase employee commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they will find support.
The knowledge of employee involvement is important, according to the professional culture experts.
But these data are useless if the company's overseers don't start with them.
In fact, when a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can give rise to expectations that changes are pending.
And if changes do not take place quickly enough or at all, they may cause disappointment and reduce the involvement of workers.
"If you ask 4000 proposals, you must be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen companies making a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Cause if things don't finish, the workers will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?"
According to this statement, Madison Reed, who is now conducting a monthly survey among employees, has been able to implement measures on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
Following the decision-making speed and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and offer communication training to deal with problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on employees and is expected to lead in the long term to the longer-term commitment of workers in the industry, which is known for its high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose clients, you lose businesses."
The bright destination of the euro area is the Baltic Baltic Baltic: incomes are growing fast fast fast fast.
Although the crisis in 2008 and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching to the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999 total economic output per person in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
There is a low debt burden, a rapid improvement in institutions and a business and free market-friendly policy.
"Baltic countries in one Slovakia are among few euro area countries where real GDP per capita is significantly closer to the EU average", reported the central bank.
Although the aim is to ensure that total economic output per person is equal to the richest Western Europe, in 2015 the total production per capita of the Baltic economies represented only 2/3 of the 15 countries, which belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to search for a better salary abroad.
While the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, local residents are not enthusiastic at all.
According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian residents assessed that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech and Polish countries, it was slightly less than half of those surveyed about economies in their countries.
The NCAA decision to cancel twice daily exercises will change the Bruins days for a long length of the Bruins days.
It's almost 23, when the trob team UCLA football players stop to talk at the edge of a new exercise field located in the centre of college.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts by revealing their work on their training camp's first day efforts on the sweaty back.
For most of the team, these force mammals offer a break from noon.
The players taking part in summer courses will go back to training after three hours to study for the final results of the joint session before coming back to the Wasserman Football Center next morning at 6.30 a.m. at the Wasserman Football Centre.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora a little before Monday became Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice daily exercises to reduce the burden on players, in fact their days have changed longer - at least until the end of the exams on Friday to one side.
For this reason, UCLA had the first three training sessions scheduled to start at 19.15 a.m., in order to fit the players into a tight schedule as well.
The transition from two training days to a day means more days with more than one training course - the beginning of the Bruins training camp was raised almost a week in advance in comparison with the previous season and for the first time during the Mora six Westwood season, during summer courses.
They will have 18 lessons up to 20 August before the formal preparations for the opening of September to take place against Texas A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA Regulation change, although it adds another item on the agenda to the players' close schedule.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they will break through this trial; they will make efforts, they will be fine young people.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it's really nice."
Once the camp is finished, UCLA training will be closed, which is not a simple task, given a clear view of the parking lot close to their fields and from an adjacent Luskin centre, a higher class hotel that has already been hit by the protection network around the gate by footballs.
From this weekend, the hotel Bruins players are taking part, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with free rooms during the season.
"Let's take security," said Mora.
"This is a real concern, and it is not too much to think that people can rent a room and practice from there.
If you have a recording of your training, it might make a pretty good deal.
But we'll use security teams in there and on the 8th parking lot.
We'll do the best we can on our own.
I'm trying not to worry about it.
We have a plan in place."
The electoral union of Savisaare-Ivanova, which was born in the Central District, was expelled from the Reform Party by Kristiina Ojuland and the EKRE, on behalf of our Tallinn and the Partyists, appears to be at least as many as the political parties are taking part in the local elections this year.
However, the chicks will be considered in autumn, and the key question will be whether they will all be given sufficient disappointment over the voters.
Who's staying with Savisar?
If there is a small decrease in the support of Edgar Savisaari, the events organised to honor his electoral union may not be known as the events organised in honor of his election union.
A member of a Riigikogu, some former and present-day central-regions and many unknown faces - will this be the composition of the electoral union?
And why some faithful followers and friends of the Savisaare may be excluded from applying for Tallinn, so that the "list of the Savis Islands", which is at the top of which is thought to be a reality of corruption and corruption crimes, is being turned into a reality?
Musical music video on the roof of the municipality's municipality's roof for the Russian poppy song of Lasnamäe's oldest part of the town of Lasnamäe; and, in any sense, the original computer game, where Prime Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the vote of the 16- and 17-year-old voters to be allowed to visit the electoral boxes for the first time when driving on a bike - is this how the Central Party is going to try the votes of the 16- and 17-year-old voters to be admitted to the electoral boxes for the first time?
We look forward to other political parties' idea of a young election campaign.
When channel 2 or TV3 viewers watch black square from the beginning of August instead of entertainment, there are two choices left: agree that they will continue to see only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English French24 channels or give up tens of every month to a television operator.
There are probably also those who start to enjoy advertising-free television experience, but ultimately - although they are reluctant - pay for television images and advertising.
The music, the loudly loud people and the trash left on the streets are almost unpleasant side effects of every major music festival.
If you do not want to share the noise yourself, however, it is worth going home instead of getting hurt at your head, and going home to find out how to go home - and sleeping a place for a cranial sum to be left to the festivalers.
Washington changes the green card rules
Media issues quote President Donald Trump, who says that a new US immigration plan is planned to change the green card rules.
The plan provides for a reduction of the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules on the acquisition of temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by Republicans and the President supports them.
The Bill will be discussed in two Chambers of Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way in which citizens of other countries in the US can issue green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces chelating and will replace the current programme.
The new application process confers an advantage on candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that come to our economy," Trump said, according to the media publications from the United States of America.
Siberian seto young people move into the city, pensioners return to the country.
Jevsejevi Anatoli will continue the tradition of former famous seto gold miners from the Manana River.
He works from home 140 kilometers from Mana's additional door at Kui's side of the picture as a gold-tarelli driver.
It's hard work: two months in a row without holidays for 12 hours work and then only ten days at home and again.
Over the three years worked at the Arelli, Anatoli has only seen gold once.
"There's a hard time: when you go in there, you'll be thoroughly checked that you don't bring wine, and when you go out there, you don't take the gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho talking to the local Seto Jani, who has told her much about her family's memories in Siberia.
The still preserved Arctic culture of Siberian sediments will also be affected by home-setos, because it is just so amazing, considers the most thoroughly distant setos studied by Piho Mare.
His first expedition to Siberia will take 30 years this year.
During this time he's been there 14 times and he's lived there for a year.
How much did you still travel out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century to gain land here?
This is an unsolved question.
I'm saying 8,000.
I took it into account for Siberia's set of men's stories, who have thought about it themselves.
It's just hard to say, because at that time, up to 30 people could come in one group, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was only given to one, but with him there were children, sisters, and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this area right here.
It was several times bigger than historical Setoma.
It had to be trained, managed in some way.
Setos came here as peasants, but their life changed because here they came into areas not only related to agriculture but also to the river (wageing), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Bethser, many sets later went to work on a classified city in Krasnojarsk-45 (as it was built by the Soviet power plant - J. P.), when it was formed.
Did the sets then form the majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of getting married and having many children remained a long time.
Seven to eight children in the family were common.
How much did Siberia's cetos culture differ from that of the mother's cetos?
They're different, although what was brought here was once the same thing there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They then made themselves (rathers), but they always made a difference between what was brought and what was done here.
Climate change strongly affected the traditional clothing of Setos, because it is colder here.
Food changes.
For example, in Setoma, the meat was salted, but it was just seen here.
Where are the villages of Siberia's settos, and what life is living there? / graph: Alari Paluots
By the way, the motherland was spiritually strong, it was considered of great importance.
I think it's starting to give it back to Setuma, it's starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived here in families have been listening to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haid village to visit Seto Kingdom Day at the beginning of July and lived for four days in homes - J. P.
What's left over here is amazing.
"It is extremely easy to come and go, as the city has a great location: the railway station and the road crossing point," says Reigo Tamm, from Tapa, from opera, from opera.
The city is not just a militaar city for a long time, we have lots of nature, sports and cultural sites, and the pizza will be on every corner of the city.
Kill is a top-top city.
There is a small island near the White River running through the city where the killers tend to keep the jaan party.
"The beautiful spot from the train window doesn't look like it", Reigo says.
Who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it.
The river water can keep a picnic and just make a romantic – you can observe the flow of the river and think ahead and back to life.
I've been walking with my girlfriends, too.
The opera Tamm has gone down the river between three bridges practicing his aarics: "For this place is by the city, no one may be able to resist when their stories are round".
"There is a wonderful view of Tape, but there are also health trails where you can run, have winter skiing and, for example, play discolf - golf course has been completed, the discs can be borrowed from the sports center", says Reigo.
The old pros go there, of course, with their chains, but I haven't been there yet.
I'm sure Mr Rasmus Kull Tape needs to be invited to visit because he's an experienced discolf player and he's got a chain.
She'll lend me a loan.
Reigo and Männämägi were inseparable from the time of their childhood.
At least during Sunday hours.
There are many tears, disappointments, and you can enjoy my sports life.
Not to mention broken buds and kisses.
"The entire central town is now full of construction work, all of it becomes unknown," reads Reigo.
But the old and tired blind house is a very attractive place where summer exposures are played.
I'm glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M. Director Märt Meos accepted my idea and had to do a summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with Aleksei Karenin has just ended, on August 11, the railway station "Education" is located at the train station when the old stable building is moving around in the 1980s.
"11-13 August is the days of the City of Tapa, in which the opening of the blind house has been opened and the series of cultural events are taking place, including the folk rally," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the city of 91 in those days.
In a small yellow cabin on May 1st of May, the parks have had a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exclusive is very much and the information is enormously provided", Reigo praises a place full of the history of the City of Tape, most of which focuses on rail and military.
Reigo says that if Tap gets through all the recommended places, he's going to be out of his stomach long enough, but fortunately he's full of coffee bars.
"We have such good restaurants and when sitting in our cafes sometimes feel like you're abroad," he describes.
The soldiers who came to Tape spend a lot of time in the pubs and coffees, which is why when they sit there, it is a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but around it is such an international company together.
I believe it would be very exciting to listen to stories from French or Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we've got a lot going on.
In Greece, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping in prison for two Bulgarians from a bulgaar.
On TV bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On 1 August in the morning, the police arrested a group of illegally camping people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but the investigation is now taking place.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free circulation and are already imposing harsh penalties on all those who are missing the rest at a place not intended for that purpose.
The inspections will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves that teach the puppies go to the sheep to break the sheep.
Hiiumaa farmers have had to give their wolves again after a year to break up from their herds "training material" - probably the wolves that taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year the wolves in Hiiu County have broken the sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and eight were injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
I had a number of only three, one year earlier 124.
There are also data from the Environment Agency that last year Hiiumaal was not born and the information from the Hiiuma Management Council that this year there were two wolf nests fixed on the island.
On Monday the wolves broke out of Emmaste municipality in Kabuna village 15 sheep and injured 18 surviving sheep.
Early Sunday morning the wolves broke a sheep in Reheselja village and seriously hurt another one who had to commit an emergency.
The rules for the treatment of genetically modified crops shall be clear.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent to the coordination circle the draft legislation on the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and the Act on the Amendment of the Plant Protection Act.
The amendment to the law leaves the establishment of a separate set of data for both genetically modified (GM) agricultural sites and operators, and will continue to use a plant health register for that purpose.
In addition, GM's obligation to have a prior agreement with the person engaged in the dairy industry within the prescribed radius is modified.
Although there are no genetically modified crops in Estonia at the moment, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the co-existence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
As long as it is not decided to declare Estonian GMOs-free," said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"The same must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account both the costs and the administrative burden for the private and the public sectors", Annex Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the GMOVS set of sites and operators’ datasets for agricultural crops and the training of management, lays down requirements for the treatment of GM crops and the start-up of economic activities.
With regard to specific honey, the obligation of GM grower to inform bees from the start of the cultivation of GM crops is replaced by an obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with bee before the start of cultivation.
The Bill of Law has been sent for coordination with the ministries.
All interested parties will have the opportunity to examine this in the draft information system and, if necessary, submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect in particular those active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Farm Agency.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed to be grown - maize MON 810.
Until then, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM crops.
The reason for this is that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a pantograph in Europe, which is resistant to MON 810 maize.
The varieties of this maize line are also developed for the southern regions and this May is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect possible GM organisms in seeds of various suvirapsis, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the sampled samples showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and, as a result of the study, it was concluded that seeds of the breeds of rape, maize and soya varieties that have grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia and that there has been no accidental contamination in Estonia.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius".
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has been recruiting Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius", after being the middle performer against Sampdoria on Wednesday night made his debut.
In the last season-time game of Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid, the player bought 40 million from Chelsea, in Dublin, started a 2-1 victory in the initials on Tuesday, with the impression that Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were given a free chance to attack.
However, while being away from the Blues pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was in no time for a necessary match and he only lasted 45 minutes, according to Mourinho, it must be fixed before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mood," said Mourinho.
"We will help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, the Aviva stadium began with the initialization of the new recruits Victor Lindelof and Romane Lukaku, and Mourinho quietly began to set up one of his early men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "great job" by concluding agreements with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to implement three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another hot dog got to his foot on August 1st, and then again on the Muhs.
According to Mati Martinson, a live bird hunter living in the desert became the first son of a bitch with an escort in Sõrve, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined a large group of nightlifes.
Because of the fact that the Sõrves is not a crop field, the wedding of the Islands is written by the wedding of the Islands.
On Tuesday, it was quite too late to ring the throats, one more son of a bitch got to the escort, and this one on the island of Muhu.
According to Martinson, installing transmitters is actually an international project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
One of the sons of bitches named Mati GSM sent by Sõrves Türju was equipped with a boy named Mati GSM.
"His doings are all over the Internet watching: how he went to Spain in winter, he came back for a long time at the border of Germany and Poland and then came to Saaremaa", Martinson spoke to Martinson.
The British inventeder had to install a microchip into his own body in order to access the house and car with a hand handle to access the house and car.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to install a microchip so that he can only open his front door with a handrail, get to the office and even start a car.
A 33-year-old Steven North was allowed to install a small chip between his thumb and his index finger, and now he offers this service through his company BioTeq to businesses and individuals who want to make their life's technology easier.
He has connected forces to Dr. Geoff Watson, a local hospital consultant for the Royal Hospital of Hampshire, Hans, Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with the medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and only 30 seconds is needed for the procedure.
The Northami company will also replace the locks of houses and cars to fit with the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married father of one child has now installed technology both home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is in the steering wheel.
The White House's expedition went to pay the taxpayers thousands of dollars a thousand and a thousand.
According to the military documents published by the TIME magazine, the White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter last month for an American production event to a southern court to pay the taxpayers almost 24 000 dollars.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One on board the President, was the central feature number of the event that took place in the White House on 17 July in the White House.
The senior officials of President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and the White House renewed industrial products on their tour from all 50 states.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire-fighting car from Wisconsin and a co-scar lift from Mississippi.
According to the documentation provided by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), a part of the presence of the White House military helicopter was required by FARGO almost 36 hours before the helicopter 'unusable' event in the southern courtyard for the purpose of landing off the southern courtyard.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," said HMX-1 Commander Day before the event in e-mail to your superior, the chief of the Navy officer in the field of aviation.
It was stated that the helicopter would arrive at the southern courtyard on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the morning of 7 p.m. for an event beginning at 15 a.m. and remain there until the yard was cleaned between 18 and 21 a.m. on the same night between 18 and 21 a.m.
The fact that, if the departure from the White House should be allowed, a return flight would be necessary due to restrictions on working time due to other Egyptians.
The initial flight crew was at the helicopter at the time of the event, and the Escaar security team remained close to the aircraft during the entire period of its presence on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents provided by the TIME magazine whether or not another Egyptian had finally failed to do so.
The Hatchi law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could breach this provision.
"We asked if it would violate Hatchi's law, and we were told not to break it," wrote the Commander.
"It's true that you have no choice," said Deputy Chief Officer.
The White House announced the event for an official event "made in America" and the Hatchi law would not have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political maladministrations.
The President supported the efforts made by the health reform that had been under discussion at the Senate event and accepted the efforts to keep government regulations under the guidance of the government.
The use of an aircraft known under the name Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them as a purely photo session is unusual.
In February, Trump took note of the fact that his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, was rolling into the background of the president's plane, and he's Twitter's account is falling out of messages which complain about how his predecessor's president used his plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of "made in America", where products were represented from all 50 states that have been manufactured by American workers from American materials," said Ms. Lindsay Walters, Minister of the White House.
HMX-1 teams are often testing around Washington and the south court in order to practice the retreat to the White House of the President of the United States of America with a centimetre of precision.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 was holding 58 samples in the White House.
According to the official, the flight to an event in America was thought to be the standard of the six-month flight flight to the flight crew.
In addition, on that day the secondary helicopters flew for 11 more hours for non-responsored grant missions.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibitors of this event loaded the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of an exhibition in the southern courtyard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the presidential flight budget documents and the exact costs due to the event are difficult to identify.
But according to the Ministry of Defence's annual prices for the 2017 financial year, the VH-3D compensation rate is USD 24 380 per flight hour.
The preliminary documents indicated the length of the flight from its base to its base of base at the Quantico Airport for 30 minutes from Virginia in both directions.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is strongly below its sum.
"The calculation of the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimated rates of compensation is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND survey, the Ministry of Defence does not include personnel costs, although they cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former White House press editor, Sean Spicer, then protected the helicopter from using it at the event.
"The idea is to show things that are made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds of people, if not even thousands of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked hard hard on.
So of course it is right to raise it."
It's not clear if Trump touched the south court in the context of the event, when he was running around with a helicopter, or not, but he was behind the role of a fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky turned to representatives of the company, throwing a joke about the company's products in his personal aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
The Grid Shoeiko - through the tears arrived peace and joy came along through the tears.
In 2011, Daegus hit Shedeiko in the last field, 800 m ran a footband and was removed from the stadium with a stickbar.
Shortly before that, he had received zero in distance leaps from the universe in China.
In 2012, the EM in Helsinki broke the low-cost injury, but at the debut Olympics in London, he became 23rd place at point 6013.
However, it did not go well.
After the opening day, after the Estonian record, the Moscow MM became the Estonian long-distance holocaust in the schedule.
Two years later he became the 15th place of Beijing MM and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but more than that was the disappointment of the athlete.
The hardest kadal ticket was only passed by Sheaki until a letter was received from the Amsterdam EM at the beginning of the visit to Amsterdam.
I'd just like to put together a fair competition once or twice.
Once," said Šadeiko.
The worse one was before: a month later, his Olympic competition in Rios was cut off due to the reefing of his first knife.
Is it time to take off - is it even time to continue with the seven race?
Is a two-day effort worth everything?
She thought for a long time, but she found peace.
I've had to think about it.
This experience is rather difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympia were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think clean.
"I knew I wasn't putting a pill in a bag yet," says Šadeiko about my self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the clean sheet upside down and move on with new momentum.
Coach Anne Mägi said that it was very difficult to look at the suffering that was being cared for, but he realized that the athlete, in particular, had to make himself clear.
After all, he was so strung off by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said that he wouldn't give up, and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mägi.
There's some kind of peace in him now.
He'll do it for his own good.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set up a new Estonian record 6280 points in the Götzise multi-competition competition.
In a high-level contest, he improved his personal peak in a shooting at about a metre (13.89) and ran a record of a close-time barrier.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of the abilities, but the deleted became just the primary sign of the competition.
The Mount that guided him for years says that Shadiko is a master student.
He's a athlete, he's good at training.
If something's wrong, or if something's wrong, he'll say it now.
He knows his body and trusts his feelings.
That's what we have to make of.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and let's follow it.
The new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.
"I'm not the one who makes the top of the exercise," he says and says, "The most important thing is getting the right knowledge, because it also provides a good result.
The local baby happiness makes it happy to be a pleasure.
Good emotions have also been offered to Šadeiko by close blessings.
Both his former trainee, Maris Mägi, and Sister Grete, recently became parents, and several contestants have received support from new Germans.
"It's been interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol, the drinking of which is equal to the brain's "training".
Livestong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big wine fan that he believes - wine can train his brain better than any other thing in the world.
He's a neuroscientist at Yale University.
It is not about alcohol, or about how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but about the process of tasteing 'very active' wine.
By snoring the glass, snoring the wine in the mouth, enjoying it and enjoying it after taste, we make our brain work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperdi, wine molecules actually contain no taste, but taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He points to the way the brain "sees" colors are shown.
"The flavour is not in wine, the taste creates wine," says Sheperd.
The things that affect the taste of wine, for example, are our age, our gender, and even the amount of spit that a person produces.
Of course, she's saying that wine isn't enough to get drunk.
"There must be more in reality," he says.
If you take too much lantern, the system will be oversized.
Too much wine drinking can harm the brain instead of doing harm - according to the 2004 study, people who are risking more than three glasses of wine, loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity are at risk.
10% of the employees in the Estonian ICT sector get fewer wages than colleagues in the colleges.
The data from the staff search company Fontes reveal that 10% of the Estonian ICT sector employees pay less than their colleagues.
Ten percent pay gap is between men and women, writes in portal genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the ICT sector wage survey inFontFontas.
The total number of posts under observation was 8 577 posts.
63% of the posts were employed by men.
"While only 3 companies indicated that the pay gap is for men and the rest of the companies considered no pay gap, in reality, compared with work similar to each other, the average wage of men is 10% higher than women's own salary and the average annual salary of men is 8% higher than for women," said Fontese analyst Ilmar Ilmar North.

The UN UN stated that the role of Afghan democracy women in politics depends on the role of Afghan democracy women in politics.
On Wednesday, the Head of the UN Afghanistan Mission said that elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates for local council elections, three women stand as Vice President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to overestimate the role of women," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent the people and be credible only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local Council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
Taliban has threatened to play its part in the electoral process, which coincides with the transition period when the role of international military operations becomes acceptable.
The elections of this year will mark for the first time when the power will be given peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysomi stated that women's strong role in the success of democracy in Afghanistan is increasing their strong role.
According to the International Electoral Commission in Afghanistan, 1.2 million women have been registered from 3.6 million voters.

In recent years, oil bags are a summer classic, which in recent years has become a single hit product, which on one of the right souvenirs will have to hang at the end of their hands, and which has been known by traders, despite its modest origin, to boil up the price bridge in accordance with the hit price bridge.
Probably one of the things that have existed for every single time in life and whose possession has not caused any particular emotion.
It's just there, and if it isn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, the shoulderbags have made a real victory and the fashion fans have replaced their fine designer bags for the bags made from simple shoulders for the summer months.
This is not only a beach bag, but it is so popular today as a street bag, and braver women even walk in the office with it.
It is, however, necessary to make it clear before the boss whether such a summer roll still sits or pays a bit more to push the wet and laptop into a slightly more formal summa.
But relationships have made the shoulder bags a true summer love for women.
For example, when reading foreign fashion models, the first thing that goes on the beach, the first thing that fashioners will do is to take a vacation trip to the local market and buy a shoulder bag to which the whole holiday time is true, and which goes with them on the beach, the market, and also the friends on the city.
Some blogs are so generous that they buy a bag greater than the market and sell or sell them to their loyal readers.
In this respect, it is worth noting that the demand for bags among readers is so great that women (and men!) go hand in hand with each other to become a happy owner of a bag.
In a sense, it is also understandable, because few are the times that some of the things that have risen up in the fashion world are possible to buy for only a few hundred euros.
True, clever traders have also discovered a simple opportunity to make money here, and so they sell thinner luxury brands for a few hundred euros and a thousand euros.
I guess it's just that the richest customers don't feel like the simplest ones that are promenizing around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy Dolce & Gabbana a shoulder bag of over EUR 1000.
However, for the interpretation of Chanel's shoulder bag, the amount of EUR 6000 may be used.
Unlike most of the fashions, the shoulder bags did not come from any great fashion, but they began far beyond their story.
It is claimed that shoulder bags are far from the Philippines, where they have been widely removed from.
The redness of the yellow bag is there, in particular, an exporator and the locals are very often unable to see how often they are going around them.
It's supposed to be from the 14th century B.C.E., and it's pretty similar to a regular earring.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be so strong as a basket, the patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and by the way more active can be attached to them.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags that have been wrapped in coloured shirts or leather strips.
However, the letters of appreciation may be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the largest of whom had never been seen before.
That's why he'd match the shoulder bag with all sorts of clothes and not even have to go to the Cannes film festival.
In terms of the popularity of the bags today, however, it does not play a minor role, but the fact that caring for them is a cockhead and unlike all other Finnishs, they do not have to be maintained by special means, but by water and wet towels.
As in the case of trend-rapes, apart from the classic appearance, brands have come out with all possible interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy yourself a red-brown, or a tiny shoulder cake from your shoulders.
However, it should be borne in mind that a classic shoulder bag will never go from fashion, but that it will be an interpreter.
But what's a classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag made of shoulders that resembles its style of basket has been opened on top of it and has short, as well as straws, hams.

GMB is concerned about investment in McVitie's Glasgow plant at McVitie's Glasgow plant.
The trade union is waiting for the cookies manufacturer McVitie's managers to confirm the long-term production plans for the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent about the future investment of the Tollcross object.
The plant where Hobnobs and Rich Tea products and other products are produced works for more than 500 people.
The owner of McVitie's company Pladis said that they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the last few years.
You'll be hired by employees and union presidents "the first to hear" if anything changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter sent to the manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's company "to take care of the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get the head of the object to clarify the business needs of Tollcross and the investment plan for the future makes our members deeply concerned.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely composed of local communities and people in the Glasgow neighbourhood, being essential for ensuring decent employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, in terms of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern Glasgow, and in the light of Brexit, the rise in living costs and the chronic decline in production, there is a serious need for a highly growing production company in McVitie."
The platform representative said: "The object manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company responds directly to it as we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting took place between the employees of Tollcross and representatives of GMB, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
So we discussed with our employees that, like all other companies operating in highly competitive and insecure economic climates, we are currently reviewing our activities - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years we have invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross object, most of it has gone into production lines and improvements in operations.
We fully understand the inheritance of Tollcross as an object of production, and if there is any change in the activity of the object, the employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about Neymar's approach?
Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt's interest in Marco Verratt's interest in Marco Verratt's against Marco Verratt's interest in Marco Verratt's against Marco Verratt's interest in Marco
Saint-Germain did not give up efforts to lure Neymar into his rows by buying him an offer of $189 million to buy him out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record conquest trip?
This glamorous approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break up more than double the acquisition of the current world records of the acquisition, which was set up last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for 89 million pounds.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will be the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid more than GBP 500 000 a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is, of course, angry because of both the approach and the free breaking of Neymar, although the close source to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since his arrival from Santo in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world three years ago for this opportunity?
When Manchester City showed an interest in the conclusion of the contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting some of the best players of the PSG.
"I don't worry because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll face them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to conclude an agreement with one of our players, they must face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have stepped across this border since the Spanish club had previously shown interest in Marco Verratt, the middle performer of the PSG this summer.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could gain this interest as a result of the reaction by losing Neymar as a form of one of its precious assets.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is seriously threatening to hit a swing between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland", warned Varadkar at the first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for people and goods to move freely, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he emphasised.
According to the asset manager, he would prefer the United Kingdom to remain a part of the European Union, and since it is not possible, it would remain part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make the exit of Great Britain more smooth would be to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Note that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could definitely have this kind of Britain."
Another way to do this would be to return to customs points, which would declare historical fragmentation and political failure.
"Peace for trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "a challenge for our generation" and warned that this outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when visiting Belfast.
Märt Found through his first half-tier triathlon: Ironman is able to pass through everyone.
At the winter capital, Otepää was held the largest triathlon festival in the Baltic States when about a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries entered the semi-long Ironman competition.
70,3 miles of distance was composed of 1,9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life also ended with the Märt Avand.
"I thought it would turn out to be complicated, and it was finally complicated," said Avandi in the finish.
Despite the complexity, the Witness found that in fact the triathlo force force is the head of everyone.
"It's not a distance that kills, it kills a pace," he said, saying, "it's a good pace that gets everyone in the finish head.
