Camille Auer wanted to fix his gender, diagnosed to a mental illness, and now he's doing art on the subject, "Man should have the right to his own body".
There are dozens of patient reports hanging from the roof of the Art Academy Project room gallery.
Each one of them contains the name of Camille Auer.
Papers tell a multiannual story about how outside people have written up their interpretation of Auer and its identity.
He's the one who decided who he is.
"I wanted to tell you about the person's exact medical history to make the process's violence visible," says Auer.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a year long study that includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will start with the dispatch of the "sex-identity disorder" diagnosis studies conducted in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had been using his estrogen on the Internet and was still very long in his own repair process.
He felt he was a woman, but according to Finnish law, a person must go through the repair process so that gender can also be corrected legally.
Translaki, i.e. the law on the sex of the transceiver (563/2002) obliges the trans-sexual people to engage in forced sterilization in order to obtain the right gender, for example, to the population register centre and passport.
At the moment, any gender correction is required for psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of infertility.
A person should have the right to decide on his own body.
"This situation is unacceptable and insults human rights," says Auer.
There has been talk about the reform of the patent in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has made provision for eight observations, and the European Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling requiring the parties to the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the right of self-regulation.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a legislative amendment under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, the Minister for Social Affairs and Health at this time.
The elections and the Basic Finns rose to the government.
Now legal change is stuck again.
This is about internal political disputes that have nothing to do with this law.
"The government does not want to put it on the table because there are differences within the government with regard to changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of the Finnish Department of Amnestyn, Finland.
Two large installations are in control of the front of the exhibition.
One of these consists of the packs and instructions for use of the medicines Auer is made up of medicines used by Auer.
In the patient's report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the transpolisian psychology of the University Hospital of Tampere from Auer.
On the basis of these reports, a psychologist met Camille Auer twice and wrote a report that should define the treatment and assistance of Auer's justice.
The perception of the reality to be examined appears to be exposed to shrinking.
The perceived perception of himself appears to be scattered and personality-related unstable features are highlighted in a limited level.
Auer did not recognize himself from these photographs.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed insane," says Auer.
An even greater shock was when Auer was not given treatment for sexual repairs.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his identity.
On 11 February 2015, Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked the transpole's waiting hall to spread television.
Later on that television was created by an art work called Monument for the Excluded, where Auer was able to express his experience of power and its use.
"It's crazy that any person identified as a woman at birth can magnify his chest, but to remove the breasts, he needs a diagnosis," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you try to be different from that of yours defined by birth.
Unfortunately, Auer's experience is not the only quality of its experience.
The gender correction process is more severe for many reasons than for purely medical operations.
There are dozens of people who should justify their existence and the right to their own sexual experience.
"It's crazy that people who are in need of support and help are denied treatment by saying that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Many people who have applied for several processes are behind mental syndrome: depression, anxiety, possible temptation experiences.
The health care professional may order that treatment cannot be started.
"Inhibition of treatment and assistance can cause people to eat even worse things than what it was before the process started," Auer says.
The personal exhibition of Auer also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
Auer writes in the exhibition text: "I've had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life, and that's what people usually feel difficult to melt."
The depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it made it easier for him to feel better.
He had finally been able to say the feelings that had existed since childhood and when he was a teenager.
Why the wide jaw was not suitable for its own body and why the breast muscles had to be round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing for Auer has been that there are people around him who see him.
Exploitation is a basic necessity.
"It's time to justify so much by talking, dressing, using sound and moving," he says.
Today Auer is experiencing his coming sight, he exists as a woman.
However, close random comments at the beginning of the process may have hurt a lot.
It's the most painful thing to do when close misunderstandings turn out to be a misunderstanding.
"They should know and they know who I am, but they can't or can't internalize it," he continues.
However, not all transhumans need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or indistinct in which the body or parts of it may cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, the use of air hormones and the long-term research process cannot be officially confirmed on their side.
"There is no medical basis for these studies", Auer says.
And that's true.
For example, in Denmark, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for recognising legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the legal sex of sovereignty.
A full-time applicant shall submit a written application for a new identity card, stating that it feels that he is another gender.
After six months of consideration, the applicant shall confirm his application in writing and the Ministry shall give the applicant a new identity card.
This sovereignty is also required for Finland and this requirement also includes Auer's exhibition.
It has not been a therapy experience for an artist; it is a political and artistic collection of works.
I want to believe that art is still of importance and that it can bring about political changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.
The exhibition by Camille Auer on Antiphallic Dick 4.-28.7.2017 at the Art Academy Project Room.
A civil civil civil civil society organisation gave travel information to Missouri, Missouri.
The National NAACP Organisation for American Civil Rights has provided travel equipment for Missouri, which is due to discriminatory state practices and racist attacks there.
"The travel information for NACP Missour will enter into force on 28 August 2017, and it calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to take extreme care when travelling in a state which has recently experienced numerous suspicious racial-based events", states the Organization's Communication.
The law that has recently entered into force in Missour hampers the right to export discrimination cases, and the enforcement of state law is disproportionate to minorities. According to NAACP, these were the reasons which led to the provision of travel equipment.
"The civil rights of people are being violated.
They are stopped on the basis of color and are abused or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of NAACP Missouri, said to Kansas City Star.
"We've never heard one of the many cases before in one short time."
The travel information about Missour is the first warning of the United States State of the Organization.
The organization mentioned the racist comments against African-American students at the University of Missouri and Tennessee, as well as the death of a 28-year-old black Tory Sanders.
Sanders died earlier this year in question, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel.
The travel notice also referred to the report by the Minister of Justice of Missour, according to which the police would stop 75% of the black driver more likely than white.
"The purpose of the travel notice is to encourage people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri", Chapel says.
For example, people must prepare themselves by including money in order to pay guarantees or by telling relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the FBI, 100 crimes were recorded in Missour in 2015 or the 16 most in the U.S. states.
Travel Warning is also an answer to the new law of Missour, which makes it difficult for companies to challenge the right to live and discrimination in employment relations.
The ACTU organisation, which defends civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had accepted immigration legislation which forces the police to arrest people for immigration offences.
As a general rule, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries, but recently NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: The Lintilä asked Finnair to report on the supplementary pension of the CEO’s supplementary pension pension for Finnair.
Mr Mika Lintilä, Minister of State for Ownership, has asked Finnair for a report on the supplementary pension fee received by Pekka Vuramon, the CEO of the airline, Yle.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the state's will manifestation.
The EUR 130 000 supplementary pension received by Vuramon rose this week when Helsinki Sanomat announced the development of the remuneration of the directors of the stock exchange companies.
The newspaper Finland reported on the additional pension of Vuramo in February.
Finnair stated that he would give up supplementary pensions in 2013.
The State has submitted that no additional pensions are used to reward.
The state owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the company, the decision is in line with the principle of ownership management for the last year.
The sanctions were immediately tightened up by speeches.
A while ago, it seemed that relations between the United States and Russia were on their way from cold to warm.
The U.S. President Donald Trump and the Russian President Vladimir Putin, meeting in Hamburg at the G20 meeting of the industrialised countries, seemed to be doing a great job with each other.
In the meantime, the atmosphere is significantly cooled down.
The new economic sanctions agreed by the Congress of the United States last week and signed by the Trump on Wednesday were a complex response in Russia.
The worst response has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the sanctions law signed by Trump means "complete trade war".
Although the Russian reactions would only be considered as cuts and overreactions to political retortism, the fact that the United States and Russia are tightening up is after the short period after Trump's election.
The passage through the United States of America, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
However, the Congress accepted the law with a considerable consensus, but the adoption of the law to the President was, according to the fact, much more difficult.
In fact, Trump has recently criticised the law that he has signed as a "markably incomplete".
President Trump's hardness must have been due, in particular, to Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting its powers must have been offensive.
As is well known, the US is investigating both Russia's possible interference with the presidential elections as well as the Trump campaign's Russian connections.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is a reality after a short September.
With the staff of the White House shifted into the wing and a variety of scandalous translations almost daily, it seems increasingly clear that foreign policy does not work in the United States under the leadership of the President, but in spite of the President.
In any case, this situation is not desirable.
If the Russian relationship is a bitter hit in the United States, the same applies to the European Union as well.
In addition to economic sanctions, an exciting security situation in the Union's nuclear region is also making relations more difficult in the Baltic Sea.
The EU has clearly set out the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least half of its policy in Russia, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a Member State which has a lot of trade with Russia, such as Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the economy.
The effects of the recent US Sanctions Act are still unclear.
In the EU, it is feared that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, effects can be felt, for example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennock nuclear power project.
In Europe, acidity has been caused by the fact that, for example, liquid natural gas lng, which is important for the US economy, has been excluded from sanctions.
Trade patents are a means of global policy to show the abuse of goods.
However, economic sanctions must be very well-considered and precise.
Otherwise, they are easily more harmed than good.
Nothing's sacred anymore, is it?
The Trump White House now has its greatest objective of freedom statue.
The absence of statues is a sure sign of power change.
The Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqis, together with American soldiers, fell down on the square of Fidos, in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of the Trump administration, knew well what it was doing in a fierce debate with CNN channel Jim Acosta. The freedom statue was attacked by Miller's attack on the word-case concerning the president's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticise himself for the statue.
If he had done so, he'd have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organisers and eminent characters from the Freedom statue.
His attack was at stake in the significance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903, Emma Lazarus' poem was added to her feet after 17 years of preparation of the statue.
This is what Miller said to Acosta: "I don't want to go in more detail about this history, but the statue of Freedom is a symbol of freedom for the entire world.
The poem was later added, and it does not belong to the original Freedom statue."
Miller himself wasn't wrong, but it's not just about history, as he said himself.
Lazarus is essential to his words, the only quality in which the state does not just call immigrants but "poor poorer": "You are the worst": "You are the most important, your por, / Your huddled mass management to break free, / The words that you are looking for."
The poem is now more current than ever.
Miller did not practice literature criticism, and he made it clear that the poorest of the poor are not welcome to the States of Trump.
The importance of the patent of freedom is part of a wider political and cultural dispute about the importance of the United States.
The friends of Lazarus, after his death, were campaigning for the poem to be attached to his statue, and they knew well that his act was strongly political.
The purpose of the pasa was to express the links between the French and American republics with a classic symbol of freedom by means of a majestic body of freedom.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, a female character is no longer an abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: a deported mother.
The connection of the poem to the image was a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American bill of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – a guide who can now be regarded as some kind of a prophecy about Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Freedom statue does not present to anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neoconservatives, who will take the United States to blow the darkness to cover up the world: "Lady Liberty is coming out.
He'll take freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The event does not show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the freedom statue depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as if poor and tired but desirable immigrants were on board long and long after the journey.
He saw it from the perspective of the people looking for protection and better life.
His freedom statue will comfort you by giving hope and welcome.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want.
The call does not indicate the path but the flames of anger, their only source of power.
Sports MM Competition 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two tickets were entered into the British national team of the United Kingdom.
Neil Black, CEO of the United Kingdom’s Public Sports Union, says that 16 Scottish members of the national team participating in the World Championships are "a significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for the World Sports World Championships launched in London Friday.
According to Black, "there's something special happening in Scotland", from which British general sport needs to learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for so long that we understand what it is" Black says.
"I visited with representatives of the Scottish Sports Institute and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
The Scottish Confederation of Public Sports again believes that it is related to the activities of the Union,
The United Kingdom's Association of General Sports believes that it is based on their activities.
And the usual street streetkeeper thinks he has something to do with the matter.
However, it is something quite awesome, which is why it is.'
In London, many Scottish athletes are seriously competing for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah in the run of 5,000 metres. Eilidh Doyle in turn was elected captain of the national team.
"Eilith is too modest.
His Captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proudly from their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eililah said there was genuine emotion and passion for sports."
Eilidh Doyle is a silver medalist at the National Championships in the 400-meter band, and these are his fifth World Championship, and he thinks it's "unbelievably" that there are 16 tickets in the national team.
The previous record was seven from 1983 and 2015.
The average traveler Laura Muir has been running five records from the United Kingdom and two from Europe over the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London. Also, you should keep an eye on him: the man has an excellent season behind him, which includes winnings in the UK World Cup and the Aniversary Games competitions.
Doyle remembers her first World Championship, when the only shot of the national team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the national team says he's 'powerful' that there are so many skis involved, some of which are seriously competing for the finals and medals.
"In fact, access to the map is a great honor, but even more specific, it is because members of the national team voted for the captain," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very proud of all the instruments that got into the national team.
It shows how far we have reached.
They are part of advocating athletes who compete for prize participants.
My speech by the Captain?
I thought it was going fine.
I was focused on how lucky we are when we have home parties.
It is important to enjoy domestic support and the fact that we are at the Olympic Stadium again.
I get a second chance to compete there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazing."
Prevention of critics on Facebook: Do not stand in public office unless you endure criticism.
Father of our country knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic policy policies always on his political principles.
I'm sure the criticism was agitated,
but he did not silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led to stupid and silent as sheep for slaughter", Washington said in 1783.
That's where we get to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented the performers from doing so.
This week, the Alliance of Citizens' Rights challenged Hogan's right to justice earlier than in the past.
His staff felt that the challenge was unfounded, and the attitude was also limited on the Internet.
This is just a Facebook, a lot of comments.
But it's important,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican governor of the state governed by the democratics.
He's had second best estimates of his activities among the 50 governors.
Hogan is not very responsive to hot.
He has firmly led the state and firmly adhered to principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main contact channel for his voters and published a picture of his head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, preventing users from entering the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The governor's page is a public and official forum that his staff maintains with tax resources.
Hogan's editor, Amelia Chase, defended the governor's activities in his interview with Washington Post, and he said it was only about the moderation of comments.
However, stamping of commentators as trolls, snakes, or haters is too easy to solve.
Washington Post interviewed Hogan on Facebook for blocking users.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to discuss with the leaders they chose, not trolls but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me that their comments were respectful, kind, and reasonable.
The pastor quoted his comments to the book; he wanted to appeal to the Catholic faith of Hogan.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not hostile, but asked a question about hate crimes.
"I am very pleased to be disappointed that Hogan had not taken any action on hate crimes and other recent news," he wrote in his comments on Washington Post's news.
"And I cannot accept that, when more people comment on the same thing, they are considered to be in some sort of organized group and ignore the citizens who are concerned by a large group."
The governor's staff called comments on the "centred attack". Someone else could call them to promote the most important issues.
It is easy to manage Facebook-time communication by preventing a critic or removing critical comments.
In the old days, staff should have been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical manuscripts, or to arrest and silence protestors.
But it's actually the same thing, right now it's just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official who has been accused of blocking Facebook and other social media channels.
Twitter users who are prevented by President Trump have tried to sue him.
The subject was the subject of a first significant decision last week in Virginia.
According to Alexander's Judge James C. Cacherises, the Government of the Loudoun County Government violated the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prevent a voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Association visited the debate with the Republican Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky on Twitter and Facebook usage.
This shouldn't be difficult.
At Washington time, low-cost postal charges had a similar effect to those on the Internet today.
From 1776 until 1800, the number of newspapers was fourfold, and anonymous writers blew Washington.
At that time there were trolls.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belize and Portius were written in newspapers in which they called for Washington's decisions.
The appeals made to the President's office on the criticism of Jay's agreement, namely the Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement between the United States and the United States of America, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of opinion and freedom of debate are the basic stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer meal for birds should be stopped immediately.
The samples have come from about a half-place, and also web-reports from two, three.
Most of them have become South and Varsinais-Suomis, but then also individual Haapavet and Seinäjoki, specialist Marja Isosmursu Evira tells us about Evira.
Her hippopotamus has died of parasitic disease called tricomonosis.
It is caused by a scientific name called Trichomonas gallinae from the beginning of the animal.
It was known before that it hit the doves, and especially the pit.
In the 21st century, however, the disease was also detected in papipolis.
The year 2009 was very busy.
At that time, trimonosis caused a large collapse in Finland’s green stock, and then the species’s stocks have been on their way to recovery.
Sick green bees have now been, but at least not yet in a large scale, the Museum Manager Juha Honkala says.
It is fear that the previous epidemic of greenballs will come back again unless there is something to do.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done each one: stop the summer meal of birds immediately.
I'll see you later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from his home field service at the Renaissance Club.
The former European first player, Ronan Rafferty, hopes to benefit from the home-field experience for the next three days, when the 25th Scotland Senior Open tournament will be held in the City of Eastern Lothian.
Last year, the Irish Rafferty led the tournament in the neighboring Archerfield Links field before the last round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Raffferty has been a fan of the new location and is a ambassador to the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad, on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvad.
"I've been working on the construction of the Renaissance Club, and with this event it's going to be filled with its glory," says Raferty.
"The players will see the field at their best.
Jerry has done a great job with this place.
He's the keen ambassador of the game, and he's proud of his accomplishments here.
The tournament is a wonderful demonstration on this field."
For the first time in its 32-year career, the English Everes defends the championship, although it has won both the European tour and the European challenging tour.
"This seems like a really special opportunity," the player in Southport says.
"I was unable to defend my victory in Extremeau Open because the tournament is not part of this year's tour.
It's amazing to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Last year's memories come back to mind: the tournament victory was a great thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a great time that we always come to remember."
Gary Orr is going back to the real-life on his own soil, and he's gone into the tour after he's been in this year's 50 years.
This is his first appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament.
"Fasting in the country is always more important than usual", says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've played pretty hard.
I'm happy with the party so far."
The three will be followed by Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, the major winners of the former Masters winner, Ian Woosnam and the senors.
The tournament is attended by six horses: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance as well as Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.

The problem was solved with possible internal air problems of the charm.
At least for the time being, there have been no internal air problems in Pori's prikat's company's commoconstruction, and the prikat was told on Thursday.
In-air investigations will continue to be carried out.
The explanations began when a man who suspended his military service for health reasons thought his health was reduced because of the bad inner atmosphere of the weakened army.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the Pori Brigade, there have been no problems with the health situation of other military officers.
It appeared that this was an individual case, and other servants of that unit had no health problems.
Each notification is taken seriously and we wanted to be fully informed of this matter.
At the moment, it is not known that we have any internal air problems, Holm says.
The record in the record says that, due to the arrival of July, goods must have been transferred to the camps, which may have led to a temporary increase in dust.
That's why the air may have been intruding, Holm says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's goldland of poverty and death.
Bartina Degei doesn't use a light in his cooking.
Even if he's a patient, he's only rarely used.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital city of the Pania region, located in the province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts the Batatin — locally “nota” — directly into his fire.
Within half an hour, the burnt Batate will be eaten with greed, naked hands.
There are no furniture at Dege's home, sitting on a mounded ground, where he usually also treats his daily pack, like in the cloudy water applied for from the nearby summer of laundry.
The station will be delivered by a bucket in the missing room.
Degei is his youngest husband of four wives and has not been assigned to care for the fields.
Mobility is common here.
Later work may be dangerous: most people in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot, and soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five in the evening," Degei says.
This is a rare pain in the upper part of the Arctic, the former Dutch colonial region, which was linked to Indonesia in 1969. The movement was preceded by a controversial referendum, where the 1 026 village elders were forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the authority of the Netherlands, quickly turned its anger on the Jakarta Government, which strictly controls the territory and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from entering it.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
The journey begins on a half-hour flight from the province capital of the province to Nabire from Jayapara and continues on a five-hour drive from the stomach to the driveway to the rental car.
There is no public transport here.
In about 19 000 city cities, there are woodlands surrounded by bamboo trees, whose aalpoltics rust has turned into clock-browns.
Few Indonesians have visited here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the people of Papua Mee Pago worshiped the Uga Tamee god.
There have been other changes.
"We didn't have any of these clothes," Degei says. He means a colorful, hand-cooked crystal head, dark teeth and a bright-colored sweater.
"And then we had only leaves covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, and 28 per cent of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and inequities are the highest in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's gold.
Pania is approximately the upper part of New Jersey with 153 000 inhabitants. Just about 100 kilometers from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world. It owns a Freeport McMiran company located in Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper to Freeport.
In addition, the Pope has an estimated $78 billion timber supply of wood.
However, these riches bring evil to the Papuas, for they mean the suppressing presence of a strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military personnel and local military units nearly 20 million dollars between 1998 and 2004. Individual officers were paid up to $10,000.
The demands of a greater sense of sovereignty threaten this source of income and are silenced by grace.
According to human rights activists, since 1969, the Indonesian army has killed over 500 000 clergymen and raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass deaths at the top of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were the proportions of genocide.
Last year, over 3 900 people were arrested by the Indonesian police during peaceful demonstrations.
In the report by the British archbishop on the year 2016, we Will Lose Everyshing reports of the cruelty of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular instruments – and pathetic attacks towards peaceful demonstrations.
"The calculation of the number of people is difficult because there are cases on a weekly basis", says Andreas Harsono, a Indonesian researcher from Human Rights Watch.
Ruves are blackmailed when Papua's natural resources attract immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of Provinces, 83 per cent are Christians, but the population structure is changing as the islands of Jaavan, Borneon, Sumatra and Sulawes move to the region in the hope of better income for the Muslims.
Jaavas Warung canteens sell roasted chicken and gado-gado-gado-weed sauce in peanut sauce.
It's hard for locals to compete.
"Moverers have started selling chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals", says Abeth You, a 24-year-old who is from Pania and moved to the province of provinces after work.
"The local women lost their client."
In the 2014 election campaign, President Joko Widodo – his nickname Jokowi – promised to address the injustice and violations of human rights in Papua.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former woodensmith won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to Jakarta's president's town of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed in Papua, and locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 and waited for him to fulfill our hope and restore justice," says You.
In Pania, there was some kind of wave base only two months after Jokowin's recent official posts.
The eleven children were singing Christmas songs near the fire in Enarotal on 7.12.2014, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared in the dark on motorcycles.
Scared children told soldiers that they should use driving lights.
According to the local pastor Yavedt Teba, the man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers caught the children and assaulted them with rifles, hitting them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, turned into a coma due to assault.
A few hours later, the construction of a State Electoral Board near the scene was set on fire, and the next day it began to happen.
About a thousand clergymen — young men and women and children — met at the football court in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They were accompanied by hunting lines for the celebration, and they began to play the traditional waita dance of the Papuan Mee Pago family, where they danced around and imitated bird singing.
Part of the protestors began to stone the police and military buildings.
When the atmosphere was heated, soldiers received an order in the inside radio system: "If the crowds resist more than three times, shoot them dead." The information is based on a official document which has not been published to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of resident of Kego Koto, a deserted situation is getting out of hand and asked the population to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told TIM about his wooden house on the wall of his brightly painted tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from soldiers' lines.
"A number of shots were shot in the crash."
Alfius Bowa was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was him," said Yohanes TIME as a tragedy. As many Indonesians used, he only uses one name.
"I saw that she was dead... "I kissed her."
Jotje Mende, the police inspector in Papua, told the journalists that the police were only "protected" police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Pappua police editor Pudjo Sulistiyo in 2015.
"It's also about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many were injured.
The information about the deaths came to Jakarta the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Jayaparu, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised that Papua would be affected by violence.
"I want the case examined immediately so that never again happens the same."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch reports on human rights violations outside the legal system.
However, he began to withdraw his speech immediately.
"The rest of the infringements took place a long time ago,
In the 1990s and early the 21st century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate infringements, but it requires certain processes," he said.
The interview with the TIM magazine in Jakarta on June 5, 2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start the explanations on Papua.
"We'll all find out in court," he told me.
The United Nations blames Wiranto for "criss against humanity." The crimes involve the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence vote in East Timor in 1999, Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases have already been investigated in the Papuan human rights violations, including the events in Pania.
The families of the victims of Pania's families are deeply disbelief about the arguments.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things haven't progressed in any way", Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this."
He says he's still living in fear, even though it's been years.
"Yes, I'm afraid" he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, and I'm afraid I'm gonna be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Egyptians are afraid to discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had abused him when he had helped him bury four victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the victim's funeral," he says.
The shots are not over.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the Pania neighbourhood in Deiya.
One died and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the head of the building company, which started when the director refused to bring him into the hospital who lost consciousness, and among the injured, there were also children.
The man who needed hospital care was a 24-year-old Ravinus Douw, who had been provided with water while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to a hospital.
Entrepreneured villagers found their minds on the construction site in front of the company’s office.
According to the police, the villagers stoned cops who were responding to warning shots.
According to the local authorities, however, a mobile police unit in Indonesia opened fire for a crowd when one village citizen was killed.
"We're terrified, we're afraid of revenge," says 29-year-old Domininggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded were brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police to take responsibility and withdraw the mobile police force from the area.
Pania has always been a problem with the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of real development fosters dissatisfaction in the Mee-, Mon-, Dani- and Damal families living in the midwest of Papua's cows.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of the popes with random attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian military soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded by arresting and arbitraryly arresting thousands of people in Pania in the name of "security of national sovereignty".
Some of those arrested will never return.
Among the Gentiles, Pania is known as a "serious, forgotten place".
Poverty encourages dissatisfaction.
There are only a few rice for sale in the Enarotal, and it is also too expensive for the locals,
Just like a sandwich.
People increase their food themselves: mainly sweets and some fruit and vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five batt games.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is sold on the market.
Ten batats only cost 10 000 rupees (75 cents).
Over time, there have been increasing differences between local and mobile arrivals, and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to the locals for better educated and more wealthy migrants.
Only a few papuan have sufficient capital and know-how to run their own business in a competitive way.
"You young people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work or money here" says John Gobai, President of the Pania Council.
The bitter Papua will have little attention in the world.
Furthermore, restrictions on international news are still strong.
Earlier this year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua even though they had been granted a temporary recognition, and the official reason was that they were unable to cooperate with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kinen, Asian Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi has not kept any promises of his election, nor has he increased transparency nor contributed to progress by removing the restrictions on news.
"Indone's restockings from the easternmost provinces of Papua and Western Papua have new risks: refusal of a visa and entry to the black list", Kine said in his opinion.
The absence of freedom of expression of the press means that only the neighbours of Papua are under pressure by the Government of Indonesia.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "numbered and widespread infringements" of Papua, including the Pania shooting scene.
These countries have also traditionally supported the Papuan liberation movement.
Arrmanatha Nasir, editor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, denied the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so covering evidence of human rights violations would be difficult".
The locals want foreign governments to be involved.
When the Dutch official delegation, led by Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayabura on 4.5.2017, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for freedom, reports the anonymous source of the meeting.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections 2019, but the clergy say that there is no longer any chance of voting for Jokowi.
"Kikowi means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Pania shooting attack," says Gobai, President of the tribe council.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of the Panics: they live under the control of a greedy and unpredictable army in the absence and poverty, in practice without health services and education opportunities.
According to Gobai, the Palestinians, like the rest of the clergy, keep the voices of "mad" that have to be paid back to Jokow.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and fear, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting attack showed a symbolic counter-representation: they buried one of the victims in a police station and an army office in the country opposite them.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not let responsible persons forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed", Yacobus says head on the stakeout.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora barks for Robert Helenius' replay for cancelling his replay: "Even his own fans don't want to see".
The pregnant series of boxers, Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisoran, was scheduled to take place on 27 May in Hartwall arena.
However, the fight was cancelled for commercial reasons.
Chisora, in a recent interview with IFL TV, is stifling the reason for the replaying of the cause on Helenius' shoulders completely on the shoulders of Helenius's shoulders.
My living in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I do not live in Finland, I do not want to sell tickets there.
The reason was my Finnish opponent.
Even her fans don't even want to see her berserk, 'cause she's sad, Chisora's bored.
Helen and Chisora met for the first time in a complete Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the match with a controversial score.
The sale of the re-galling ticket went off, and its promoter, Nisse Sauerland, told Ista-Sanom in May that the match has been moved to autumn.
There's been nothing new about the game.
However, the withdrawal will no longer be harmful for Chisora.
The fight would probably have been canceled after Chisora got sick.
Thursday, three days before the date of the match, I woke up in severe pain.
The barrel was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to operate, Chisora tells me.
The British says that they are currently in some 45 % condition.
He is not interested in a re-election match with Helenius, he is at the end of Dillian Whyte.
Chisora suffered a loss in December.
Your power came back to repeat your power in the city of Dubai, Dubai, a Torch pilot pilot pilot pilot pilot in the city of Toronto, Dubai, Dubai.
The flames took over the world’s highest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of residents had to escape from a building of 337 meters high on the 79 floor.
This was already another fire within two years of the building, whose name happens to be Torch, a fluke.
The building was empty, and no one is known to be injured, and the reason for the fire was not understood immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and woke up in the fire alarm noise and people's screams.
We ran down the stairs from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," said the resident George Reuters.
According to the Dubai rescue team, fires were set off at 4 a.m. local time and remained to cool down the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who left their homes.
The case can reinvent questions about the safety of materials used on high building surfaces around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Governing Board carried out a study on the fact that the most damage was caused by the curtains and plates used for the insulation of the public works.
In Britain, police believe that London’s Grenfell Tower insulation and curtain boards could have contributed to the rapid progress of flames in the fire of 80 people killed in June.

In the United US, more than 20% of air passengers take on board aircraft prohibited items, reveal a survey survey.
A survey for air carriers reveals that more than 20 % of passengers in the United States were deliberately or unconsciously transported by aircraft through the inspection points of the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA). At least six per cent of passengers had knives or other sharp objects which they did not know were prohibited.
Less than 1% reported that they had only subsequently learned that they had transported weapons, ammunition or explosives in error.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the request, and it was carried out by Stretos Jet Charters; the results also reveal that young passengers are more likely to undermine the rules.
19.7% of passengers who were aware of TSA rules were Y-generation representatives and less than 15 per cent were members of the X-generation generation.
The most common rules were broken by taking food and liquids into the aeroplane.
More than 3% admitted that they had taken sharp objects consciously into the aeroplane. In addition, 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that they had taken illicit drugs consciously into the aircraft.
The survey involved passengers from all parts of the United States. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally passed security checks and how many had done so knowingly.
It is not surprising that most passengers are also most likely to pass security checks — knowingly or without knowledge of the risks of smuggling goods.
But as the company that made the questionnaire notes, TSA's instructions are very complicated and confusing.
Passengers often don't know what liquids they can take to the plane and how much.
So it's no surprise that the majority of TSA's prisoners are fluids.
For a while there was also a feeling that no books should be taken into the aeroplane.
You can take the leaves to domestic flights, but not to international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environment Agency, wheeled his decision to delay the decisions taken during Obama's period to reduce emissions emissions.
Since the 15 States had challenged the case of Scott Pruitt, Head of the EPA, the 15 States, and Pruitt withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions to reduce the emissions of tobacco from Obama during the administrative period.
According to the menu, the change shows that the Agency that it manages will take better account of the needs of decision-makers in the state of the environment.
Pruitt did not mention the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The States should start complying with the requirements for ozone in the ground with effect from 1.10.2015.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would transfer the implementation of the decisions for a year to allow his agency to have more time to examine the plan, because the Agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or to hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the general prosecutor of Oklahoma State before President Donald Trump appointed him as head of the EPA, known as the opposition to stricter environmental regulations.
After entering Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuels industries.
The sudden change in the middle of the week is the last setback for the Pruitt plan to reduce the provisions.
The Federal Defence Court in Washington last month adopted a decision that the Director of the EPA exceeded his mandate in order to delay the implementation of the Obama Administration decision on oil and gas companies.
In its opinion on Wednesday night, Pruitt argued that his full version of the ozone provisions would only strengthen EPA cooperation with the States in a complex process aimed at meeting new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the past administration, EPA often failed to comply with the deadlines and then expected activist groups and others to challenge the right to agree on the timetables", Pruitt said. In his previous action, he appealed to the Agency for the Environment more than ten times.
"We do not believe in the regulation through the trial and we take the time very seriously.
We also take seriously the regulation on our activities and the powers that we give them."
However, the EPA opinion concluded that Pruitt could continue to use 'the powers to delay enforcement of decisions and other legal powers' to ensure that the provisions 'are justified and are based on best available information'.
In Congress, the Republics are driving a wider change in the ozone provisions.
The objective of the legislative initiative adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions for at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on by the Senate.
Eric Schneiderman, the General Prosecutor of the state of New York State, who brought an appeal to the EPA this week, said that the group was going to continue to press on.
"EPA's change in our claims is a significant victory for the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are exposed to the direct effects of smoke in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the complaint included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Earth ozone is generated when emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemical lakes react to sunlight in the atmosphere, for example.
This form of smoke can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive groups of people, which is also part of thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health promoters and environmental protectors welcomed the surprising shift in Pruitt's direction.
"It's worrying how much pressure was required to make the guy responsible for our breathing air use a healthy sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must fight against Trump's administration, as it is its ideal aim to act on the terms of pollutionists and other groups that have their own interests."
The car manufacturer is coming from a street-tanner - "to happen with Ferrari style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while seeking to stick to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrari style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said that plans were planned for the media conference Wednesday Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer presents his new five-year plan, Automatic News news.
All cases in East Savo of the same species of the same virus as East Savo.
Rantasalmi is a virus of the same type as the previous cases of East Savo, informing THL.
The virology laboratory of the health and well-being establishment has verified on Thursday that the fifth infection of East Savo has the same viral load with previous infections.
THL has ensured that a person on the beach on Friday 28 July confirmed herbicide infection is the same as the previous case in East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all the infections in East Savo are linked to the first herd in June in the region.
The news is good, because that means that we have not brought up other types of vaccine virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth disease could occur between August and August, and the epidemic is therefore not over yet, says Mirkaleena Erkkilä, the doctor responsible for basic health diseases in Soster says.
No new outbreaks or suspicions have occurred since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their vaccination protection is up-to-date, Erkkilä reminds you.
On the subject: In Pirkanmaa, three new strains of herds have been verified - "In additions or epidemics are very unlikely".
Finland prepares for the work of a licensed shield. Finland prepares for Finland to prepare for the work of a licensed shield.
The real soup wasn't even considered legal.
The basis is that the process, along with wine, produces methanol, which is toxic.
It's legal next year to prepare a shield, but it's not even a matter of considering the legalisation of a point-to-be soup.
The shields are made by use, and the point is again by distillation.
In the context of the distillation regulation, there is a reason that the process, along with wine, produces methanol, which is toxic.
There has been no political will to place a point in the regulation of soup for every man's right, government counsel Ismo Importing from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health commented on it.
When the Ministry prepared the reform of the law on alcohol, the distillation of the facts was not considered lawful.
Nor was the issue brought to the political table.
No debate was held on the liberalisation of the distillation, Mr Outi Mäkelä (Kok.) says.
He is a group of parliamentary parliamentary groups who took up the reform of the alcohol law.
A permit for distillation at home is not even possible from the application.
In addition, commercial manufacturing shall be kept as a licence holder.
Importing tells us that home-making of alcoholic beverages becomes a simple rule: alcohol can be prepared by visiting home.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine at home, you can make a legal scream even at home.
The Government has wanted to simplify the provisions.
The new law removes requirements for flavourings and flavourings and allows for the production of the cat, Mäkelä to be specified.
The preparation must be done in such a way that the raw materials or flavouring substances resulting from their use are clearly visible in the drink.
The new law allows you to make yourself as much as you want, and you can give yourself a gift for your own alcohol.
It must still not be put into sales.
The doing of the shield is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Import believes.
A much larger change occurred in 2004, when passenger imports from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol bill will be processed by the Parliament as soon as the September cycle starts.
The sitting was held at 5.9 p.m.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if the Parliament had already taken a stand, the Mountain is delighted.
Oscar Pistorius was praised as escort escorted to the hospital by armed guards under armed guards who were escort escorted to the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius, who was suffering from chest pain, was commended for heart attacks in South Africa.
Pestorus has already got out of the hospital.
Oscar Pistorius is suffering from his prison sentence in the prison of Ildridgeville.
According to the British magazine Mirror, Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital this morning as escorted by armed guards.
Pistorius suffered chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
Prison informant confirmed that Pistorius was taken to a hospital for research.
On behalf of the editor of the Pstorius family, he told me that the former top athlete is fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the six-time gold medalist of Paralympic Paralympics for six years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Pestorus shot Steenkamp in February 2013.
Dred phone chat calls reveal Trump's pressure on Mexico to build a border wall to build a border wall wall.
Telephone interviews between the President of the United States of America's Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders have leaked to Washington Post.
In a telephone debate on 27 January 2017, Mr Trump called on the Mexican President, Mr Peña Nieto, to end his public statements on the fact that he was not going to pay the proposed limit.
The President of the United States called on Nieto that this had failed the wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign by promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
Washington Post also published an Iitterisation on the first call from Trump to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. During the call, a rough exchange took place.
Trump said to Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia is "insolent", "insolent" and "insolent." According to Trump, the agreement negotiated in Obama's term would make him look like "idioot" because he had proposed a ban on the housing of refugees in the United States.
Trump stopped calling by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most uncomfortable call all day long".
Georgia slaughter: Activaters reopened racist lunacy in the hope of justice.
The Ford Mercury car leaves a crowd in Monroe's small town in Georgia's countryside and continues its journey towards a small bridge between Moore's Ford.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men are blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
The leader of a crew, a middle-aged man dressed in a straight suit, takes a deep breath from his curfew, and he moves through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-o-o-o!" man yawns.
"Get out of the car!"
The rumors break the silence when a young black man gets pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this shocking event is only a re-ship, which was presented on 22 July 2018.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.7.
However, shock blows are real when the hanger is thrown in the neck of the Roger.
Since 2005, human rights organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to re-arrange the events of 1946. At that time, Ku Klux Klan had two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested during these years – although murderers live among us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps in the restructuring arrangements.
"It's a shame of history, but above all it's a burden that weighs our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and former Georgian Congressman.
To him, the re-shipment is a shocking call for action, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to be brought to justice, and we want things to be concluded, and we want to recover from sorrow and make reconciliation, but above all we want justice," Brooks says.
"We can't recover and make peace until we get justice."
The medical examiner covers the body of the dead victim in Georgia's slaughter 27.7.1946.
According to the FBI documents from the NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of being ploughed.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists believe that the motives of lovering have been always known to the local community: politics and sex.
In 1946, black women in the state of Georgia were given the highest right to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court gave its decision in April, and the elections were held during the summer.
According to the FBI, during the election, there was an incident in which a black landlord Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, the city was told that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting her child.
According to the FBI, the powerful white landowner, Loy Harrison, paid $600 of Malcom's guarantee against him from prison on 25.7.1946.
On their way home with Malcom and Dorothy were their cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their cars before the Moore's Ford bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and committed murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, and the authorities involved in the murders and destroyed the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks expresses the matter more radically.
"It was a hit on voting rights," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to inform black people that they would do the same if they were going to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been running the reconstruction of Georgia's massacre for almost a decade.
It is a description of the shocking racism that many people would like to believe has already disappeared from today's United States of America.
It's hard to look at the performance, but it's even harder not to look at what Greene says it's meant to be.
"We don't want to talk about the delay because we have to face our own dark side," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s exercise began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen blacks and twenty whites — met to listen to Greene’s routine summary of the performance.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's assistant director.
He has presented the head of the local Ku Klux Klan in the re-shipment for years, but the role is always equally difficult and hostile to the role of the local Klux Klan.
"It's gonna feel dirty, 'cause I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this side of history is also being displayed so that it will never again be repeated.
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnet Hester, practice their mountains.
The performance starts with a scene where Malcom yells and works for Hester, and he's upset that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
Didn't you hear me?
Rascona, Hester, responds.
Then there goes the shot.
And then all (at least all the black actors) are going to laugh.
Greene laughs harder.
"What?" Rascona's asking.
She's confused.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"Et," Greene's making a bloat.
"I just don't think white people used the word n--o at that time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you have to use a longer version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room's power is a friend's spirit.
Everyone wants to succeed, not just for the show, and they want to respect the memory of those who killed them.
The scene starts at the beginning.
Now the Rascona's words are shuffling.
No one's laughing.
The re-shipment will end quickly and violently.
Strange, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral is standing next to the bodies and singing the Billie Holiday Strange Fruit song.
His voice is broken at every other word.
A few ten metres from five to twenty viewers wipes their eyes with sweat and tears.
Almost half of them are black and half white.
There's a couple who's come to see a show from Ithaca, New York, but most of it is local.
They've been on Brooks' guidance to the victim's graves in Georgia's pressurizing humidity.
The murders have changed from story to story, and the atmosphere at the site of the event is heavy.
After the performance, Greene invites the crowd to check on the bodies.
Children are tearing themselves to look at the fake and non-immobilized bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy looks like he reminds himself of himself.
In a few minutes, Greene would like to thank the audience.
The actors who played the shorts took off their references and wiped away tears.
Bradshaw's going to hug Marbaughi, a man from the local Ku Klux Klan leader.
Nick Rascona's gonna hug two actors and then get drunk after a rough show.
"It's okay," the woman who was involved in the show makes me feel better.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for a good reason."
Later, the audience and actors will meet together for dinner together.
The white couple from Altanta is having a lively discussion of the performance with the black couple they just met with.
Denise Duplinski is hard to find words when he describes the feelings that show has raised.
"It's hard to listen to terrible words and look at terrible deeds that they say and do people who look like you – precisely because they look like you," he says.
"My presentation found that we're still taking place", he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for listeners sitting on the same table.
He's already told me that he started planning next year's presentation.
"Re-report is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors we've experienced, but it's also an educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't learn from it.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Growing up plants in shops is heavy: By removing this number of "excess", you really save money when you save your life.
Is it permitted to remove the flower-cane leaves already in the store before weighing?
What about taking away a big hat from the pineapple... that weighs as much as it weighs?
The answers are strong enough: for one, it is an indication of the extremely exported doll, while others do not want to pay for those parts of vegetables that are not used and who, however, go to trash at home.
We'll be able to identify the phenomenon in the stores.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the K-Citymarket vegetables section of Helsinki Ruoholahti, for example, because many rip off the leaves of the flower cane, for example.
They're taking the leaves from the formula into organic waste.
According to the news published by the economic orders, sneezing with vegetables wonders about traders.
But how much do you really save money before weighing out the extra ingredients of vegetables?
How important is the method of sneering really a matter?
Women tested how the price changes when they take off the leaves or put away the leaves from the pineapple, the lattina, the lattina, the spices, the broccoli and the florist.
Coat: EUR 2,10 for the price of the price of the price of the price of the florist, EUR 1,80, when it poured out all the leaves out of it.
Pines: the price of the whole anaaa price of EUR 2,30 paid was reduced to EUR 1,95 when it was turned away from its position.
Latva-artisokoka: EUR 2,60 came to EUR 2,40 when the short-end position was cut off.
Herbs: Two sweets cost a total of 75 cents.
The stocks were priced at 60 cents a day.
Broccoli: Medium-sized broccoli paid EUR 1 and without a carry 80 cents.
Outcome: If leaves and stocks go off, save at least a few ten cents at the best for one vegetables.
As a percentage of the estimated cost of vegetables decreased by up to 20 per cent.
Hence, a total of EUR 1,20 would have saved these purchases.
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the Brass Star concluded a five-year contract with the PSG for five years with the PSG.
Brazilist Neymar has concluded a five-year contract with the French football club PSG, reports AFP.
Previously, on Thursday night, it was reported that the representatives of Neymar had paid the purchase price of EUR 222 million to FC Barcelona in the Spanish league of football.
The maximum amount of EUR 222 million is the largest amount in football history.
Previously the record was made by Manchester United, who paid EUR 105 million last summer for Paul Pogba, Frenchman from Paul Pogba.
Spain too rejected the transfer earlier on Thursday when it rejected the first payment undertaking of Neymar's representatives.
According to the rules of the league, the buying society cannot pay the buy-out price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy his contract out, which happens by recycling the money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He will be introduced to a new domestic audience at the opening of the PSG season against Amiens on Saturday.
Uefa will examine the details of Uefa.
In addition, Barcelona provided information on the payment of its contribution to the European Football Union Uefala in order to enable the Union to determine any disciplinary action which may result from the case.
Amongst other things, the Spanish President of the league Javier Tebas has suspected that PSG's abuse of money is a violation of the rules of Uefa's financial fair play.
Uefa can punish the company that makes more than EUR 30 million loss over three years.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymar does not automatically break its economic cycle.
The transfer of Neymar to PSG affects the society's economy for several years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may sell several players in significant amounts, Uefasta was informed.
PSG owns a state-owned qatar company Qatar Sports Investment.
The president of the Society will be former tennis professional, Nasser al-Khelaifi,qatarian Nasser al-Khelafi.

An attack in Kabul: Naton's soldier died in a suicide attack.
A suicide bomber hit a military bomb in the Afghan capital city of Kabul. According to the authorities, he was killed by a soldier from NATO and several others were wounded.
According to NATO's statement, five soldiers and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local data, three civilians were also killed in the attack on the Quarabag region of Kabul.

On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber attack on Iraq's embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO's opinion, a Thursday night explosion occurred when the joint patrol between NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by "man carrying an attack on an actual explosive device".
The opinion stated that all injured persons were stable and were treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the writers, the strengthening of the Taliban and the presence of an ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO forces near Bagram.
According to the UN, in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, at least 1 662 civilians were killed, of which 20% were killed in capital cities.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area where the main residence mainly of chiiamuslims.

On the last day of May, in the centre of Kabul, over 150 people were killed in a bomb attack that was the most devastating attack on the land after the US-led troops were hit by the Taliban in 2001 by the forces under the Taliban regime.
Violence stresses Afghanistan's unstable situation when President Donald Trump is considering whether the United States is sending more troops to help the local army and police.
According to the reporters, recent weeks of suicide in Kabul have also significantly undermined human confidence in the government, its policy, and in particular President Ashraf Ghana.
The EPA will round up its decision to postpone the implementation of smoke smoke provisions.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reiterated its decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken by Obama during the administrative period to reduce the emissions of cigarettes on the day after the 15 States had been suspensived by the Agency.
According to the Agency, the decision to implement the so-called "Ozone definitions" was announced by the EPA in late Wednesday, indicating its commitment to co-operation with States Parties.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the States," said President Scott Pruitt in the Agency's opinion.
In June, Pruitt announced the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of ozone determinations for one year by October 2018. According to definitions, the smoke rate is to be measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollution has to be reduced in accordance with more stringent air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency appealed to the Court of Justice for the 15 States, which are primarily the Member States governed by the democratics, including District of Columbia, which claimed that the suspension of the execution was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has been looking for ways to reduce the environmental rules of Barack Obama. According to the Trump, measures are part of a broader economic growth programme.
The tougher measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the health effects of increased emissions.
According to EPA's website, ozone-containing air breathing "may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the leading bodies of the Daddys had also sent Sydney the building blocks of the bomb.
According to the doubt that the bomb was intended to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check came to an end.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company stopped.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a toxicly coloured gas-fired device and take the device to a public location, such as a public means of transport.
Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were caught in police raids on Saturday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue as well.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaschenko are discussing a possible match at their first meeting at a meeting with Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomaschenko.
Vasyl Lomaschenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course for the most interesting boxing match for the nearest future of less than 66.7 kg, met on Thursday for the first time in the second day of Thursday.
The men were in their own rooms at ESPN Sports Hospitals in Los Angeles until WBC's undefeated light-series champion Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatšenko, the WBO's top-sleaper champion.
On Saturday, Garcia won the former four-weight world champion, Adrian Broner, with a unanimous decision. After that, Garcia and Lomaschenko have been among the top five, on the list of boxers of different printing classes.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck with the fight!"
Lomashenko defends his title against Miguel Marariaga on the ESPN channel from seven Saturdays.
When the twin scored for photographers, Lomatšenko's manager Egis Klimas pointed out that the match between men would be "the perfect for sizes".
"I'm a former feathers-sex," Garcia reminded me.
"I've been working on a series higher [63.5 kilos] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 63.5 kg in size.
I want to go back to the light show.
He has to climb into his light series [61,2 kilos]. Then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Fill in their wishes."
Lomašenko agreed.
"Necking needs this match."
Klimas asked if the match was to be held on the pay channel. It is part of his strategy for Lomatšenko to debut in a light series later this year and will take the next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 knock-offs). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the game between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell will take a light show in Forum on 23 September.
"The act could be on the pay channel because the fans have asked for it", Garcia said and later announced she was ready to fight on a channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention as anyone else.
I'll be fine as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said he'd appreciate Lomašenko as "an unbelievable fighter" and maybe he's going to go see Saturday's match.
Lomaschenko shut down the whole Garcian leak and said that this three-print champion from Riverside seemed to be "from the point of view. Sorry, Mike... but you needed it to be ruined."
Garcia said he was focused on first showing the force of attack and then boxing.
Men said they felt that the fight between them wanted to be more and stronger.
"This is the match we're waiting for.
No other match will draw as much attention and interest.
I'm definitely involved in this case", Garcia said.
Lomashenko said that he expected to be able to fight against the best. "Mike is a legend.
It's gonna be a great game."
The average wage of EUR 5 300, the training that happens - the situation of investment advice was 'vill and free'.
The quality of investment advice has been a lot of talk lately.
Last time Helsingin Sanomat told Rita, 68, to whom the banker’s investor spoke a full piece of money when selling investment products.
Investment firms and different rules on the sale of investment products will be strengthened at the beginning of next year.
These improvements are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
The assessment of the skills of investment firms and employees selling investment products is currently mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no defined skills requirements in the law.
The financial sector (FA) recommends that those working in an investment service carry out its own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has authorised the organisation of diplomas for a company called APV Investment Studies Oy, whose group of students sits in both financial supervision (Fiva), universities and industry experts.
The degrees are 12-15 credits, and their exams are prepared by Aalto EE, which provides business management development services for Aalto University Executive Education Oy.
On the website, it is reported that, in general, both exams are "very wide in terms of requirements".
The educational material of the studies includes 10-15 books and numerous other books and works.
Markku Savikko, CEO of APV Investment Studies Oy, says that the pass percentage of exams is roughly 70 per cent estimated at around 70 per cent.
Of the staff of the largest banks, the largest number of investment services have been carried out either by APV1 or APV2 as they are compulsory under their own rules.
Then there are smaller bankers without mentioning names whose staff seems to have been afraid of completing qualifications, says Savikko.
According to him, such banking transactions are "a few".
According to the receipt, the APV1 degree has completed 13 000-14 000 persons since 2000 and about 3 000 persons who are recommended to investment firms.
Some bankers consider the completion of the degree to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have much stricter skills requirements.
Savikko says that the Financial Services Recommendation requires the performance of APV qualifications, because that is when investment-related skills are ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment advisors make several thousand euros per month, including commissions, nature allowances and profit commissions.
The average annual working hours of the month-on-year period are approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, employed men earn more than EUR 5 900 per month and women earn more than EUR 4 500 per month, respectively.
On average, the average 10 percent of the money earns about EUR 8100.
Tenths of the most successful men earn more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one tenth of the women making the most money earns 6 400 euros or more.
Investment firms may provide investment advice only to an authorised company.
To date, the level of employment and employment has been entrusted with self-regulation.
According to Reva, the audit carried out by it received individual cases where the professional qualifications and qualifications of an investment firm were not sufficient on the basis of the advice activities carried out by the consultant.
The seller of investment products can also act in principle even if the skills and qualifications are at a low level.
Firstly, in this respect, the situation has been wild and free.
Most other sectors have much stricter skills requirements, Savikko states.
According to the receipt, from the beginning of next year, this will be subject to tightening up with the new Financial Markets Directive (MFID II).
It requires each company to be responsible for the adequate skills of investment services personnel.
In turn, financial control may have the power to determine what to know.
The market surveillance officer Marko Hovi reports that one of the clear changes today is the instrument for the knowledge and experience of investors and investors of investment products.
According to the procedure, the new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and related agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
According to a presentation by the Ministry of Finance, the hospital reports that, according to the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may have the power to determine knowledge and experience.
Exactly what they are, these visions will be decided in the coming autumn.
The company shall also continue to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and further training.
All of this needs to be documented, and the company has the obligation to show that it has also been done.
The Court states that in practice, the company must, for example, examine staff's activities at individual level.
This will certainly be subject to different standards depending on whether it is investment advice or product sales.
According to the treatment, the new one is also required to work time with someone more experienced, if knowledge or experience is not sufficient.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with a person meeting certain time criteria.
According to the procedure, the rules are tightening up and becoming more concrete.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will be tightened at the beginning of 2018.

Imatra's blue-baked coastal schoolers will not be rushing rain or sun roasting - Iines Kakennen has a st with the help of a swimba with the help of a swimming swimbat.
Mr. Kakannen came up at a good speed, Taina Kiknen followed with him.
Imatra's beach swimming schools are running with Liette and Lempka for this and next week.
While it's raining and then it's raining again, young swimmers don't have a mitzvah, it's like a swim school driver, Taina Ikene.
In bathing schools this week, a total of 13 children, next week a dozen.
The number of children in the next week has been affected by the fact that the school and the escar were beginning at that time, and the assessment of Ikkenne was based on the fact that the school and the Eskar began.
Imatra Beach School is co-organized by the Sport Joint Project and the City of Imatra.
Thursday, on the narrow beach, there was a nice atmosphere.
The sun and the young swimmers were training to stay on the surface with sleepovers, someone already without a word.
The water also enjoyed the smaller siblings.
One of Kakko's, five thought it would go deeper into the water.
Taina Iken, however, encouraged her to kneel toward the beach.
It's great.
Eines Kakenen told me that he's been swimming a lot this summer.
She's a good swimmer.
Like Iine Kakkonen, with a sleeper village, used to exercise the sleep a little bit in the sleeptime with Vili Huhtonen, 5.
You too must be satisfied with the achievements of today, the swimsuits bragged.
Jami Kallio, 4 again wanted to see the water war.
His daughter, Anna Villberg, 6 nights from the beach, thinks that beach swimming school is a good start for swimming.
Even though the weather has been going on, Anna would have liked to go here every day.
We're supposed to warm up between.
The swimmers packed up on the dock.
The boys had enough to do with the frog found on the beach.
Milja Lukkonen, 3, and Anna Villberg spread towels to the platform, snacked the fruit and baked the day.
The water continued to teach, but the dock didn't have to hurry.
The kind that doesn't belong to summer.
An unknown soldier is sold toilet games, "There's a story that's not yet together".
You see things like that.
A blue product that manufactures cleaning products was fertilized a few days ago by an unknown military product series.
So, uh, uh, dishes and laundry, and, uh, "wc-har with a broom brush."
The unknown soldier refers to the film and movie marketing received this autumn night's first night.
However, there is something special about the combination, and the products have been cut off in social media: When will the unknown health effects come?
I need to call the company and see what this is all about.
What does Aino Määtä say about Blue Products Deputy Executive Director Aino Määtä?
We're partners in the film.
We support this film, like many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film, says Mättä.
According to him, products become a special feature for shops, and thus the film gets visibility.
Isn't this something funny - often when you think that products and related stories would have something in common?
Yes, it is this sort of uniting story that we are Finnish operators and these are Finnish products, says Mätte.
According to him, the company supports his same Finnish fundamental values as those who have seen the old Unknown soldier.
And cleaning is not a stranger to an army culture, Mätä notes.
Other business partners in the unknown military film include Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato, for example.
To date, for example, Hartwall vichy has been placed on the market, known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela.
Unidentified products already perata Suomen Main page blog Kalle Kinnununen
There are already coffee and bells available.
I would point out that there is still time for the film to be made at first night, so there is still time to go on.
As far as unknown partners are concerned, their war products have not yet been revealed, for example, by Valio, refiner, Neste and German retail chain Lidl, Kinnunen writes.
The new results of the old age tests for Swedish asylum asylum asylum seekers applicants were published published on the publication of the new results of the Swedish asylum asylum asylum asylum asylum asylum asylum asylum asylum seekers age tests.
The latest results of the medical tests for asylum seekers in Sweden have been published. The results of the tests carried out by the new evaluation method reveal that more than 80 % of the tested were determined to be over 18 years of age, but not all consider the tests reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Legal Medicine started testing earlier this year.
The new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was assessed that it had failed to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be underage.
As far as 6 880 tests have been carried out by the Finnish Immigration Service so far, the Agency for Legal Medicine has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
The tested 80%, i.e. 2002, were determined to be more than 18 years old. In addition, in 25 cases, the Agency determined that the test was "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that an asylum seeker is " possibly less than 18 years old".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age of the applicant’s notification.
Johan Göransson of the Agency for Legal Medicine tells us that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly uniform. Big differences in the statistics of the previous months are not visible", he told The Local magazine.
Although the majority of applicants were defined as being over 18 years old, it does not necessarily mean that applicants would have lied about their age.
In May, the Agency announced the results of the 581 tests and announced that in 442, there were "reports that the investigator was 18 years old or older".
After the same results were examined by Svenska Dagblade, it appeared that in 243 cases the applicant had openly announced that he was going to perform this year for 18 years.
The medical age assessment method used for the tests takes X-rays of wisdom teeth and magnetic images of knee cords. Then dentists and radiologists analyse the pictures. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the endokrinologist Claude Marcus, who is involved in the assessment of the biological maturity of humans.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Agency for Legal Affairs, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is absolutely possible to say that the risk of determining the child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk is in a situation where the testee will soon be 18 years old, and then the risk will be around 10%."

The governor of Western Virginia will change party to the party.
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced that on Thursday night at the Trump campaign event, he was changing his party.
"The Democrats simply rejected me," Justice said.
"Now I can tell you after many prayers and thorough reflections... today I will tell the Western Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Democrats."
The audience broke out with lasting applause.
"To become a member of the Republican Party of Finland", Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign campaign.
Trump won 42 points in Western Virginia because Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of its assets is about $1.59 billion.
On Thursday afternoon, the National Committee of Republics (RNC) published an opinion that "The Party of Governor Justice is again a new blow to a democratic party that would rather build obstacles than a better America."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and less states than ever. In this situation, Justin's announcement is the last setback for a party that has no leadership and cannot find a positive message that combines people", Ronna McDaniel said in his statement to the CBS's news.
The lightnings soaked damage - coming from Thursday morning, even during summer nights of the day of the summer.
From the end of the week, we'll also get more of these thunders to South Finland.
Over the last week, particularly in the central and northern parts of the country, and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
The night between Wednesday and Thursday, the lightning attacks set off a number of fires.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the day of the day of the summer so far.
The deserts have finally found Finland as well.
Over the past week, particularly in the central and northern parts of the country, and in the region of Varsinais-Suomi.
By sitting down, lightning struck the electric center of the liner, causing a small fire.
The rescue facility received a notification of the fire about a quarter to a half a Wednesday.
The power station was located in the sauna room at the end of the liner.
The rescue plant filled out the roof and wall to find fire bags and quickly shut down the fire.
A total of 11 apartments were left with no electricity, but personal injuries were avoided.
On a vacation again, the lightning lit the fires of a foreign building in Harjulanti before midnight.
At the time of the rescue, the building was already full of fire, and the rescue facility had no other choice but to prevent the fire from spreading.
The outdoor building of about fifty square meters burned to the ground.
In the direction of the coup in Rääkkyl, again the lightning hit a home house in its own country.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a stamping lightning attack.
The rescue facility visited the scene to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get a fire before the fire... only a few fuses came to an end.
In traffic, thunder caused problems on the train track between Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when the lightning hit damaged the traffic control system.
The error occurred between 8 and 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which the trains were replaced by buses.
The problem was only corrected a little before five afternoons.
Since then, rail traffic has also been able to continue normally with the speeding track of the wind.
The lightnings have sown destruction throughout Finland.
However, lightning has been relatively small this summer.
These summer's thunder stories have been so bad! Rating The weather science facility's sun-like meteorologist Jari Tuevinen.
In the middle of the week and Thursday the thunderstorms have been mainly moderate in intensity, but thanks to the little lightning rainfall of summer, it also seems to be a lot of even powerful.
This could seem really tough, but that's what it's been like compared to this summer's wedding, says Tuevinen.
On Wednesday, the earthquakes swept 1 700 times, and on Thursday there has been potential even for the toughest day of summer: by about 16 a.m., there were 1 790 landlands in the ceiling.
If lightning continues at the beginning of the night, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuevinen predicts.
The previous record survey year was held in 2015, when the number of lightning in the year was about 30 000 copies.
By Wednesday, this year’s lightning volume had risen from 18 386 to a secret.
It is, then, to the extent that this year is not a breach of a two-year 'presidency'.
However, the ostrich can wait to continue.
According to the imported land, Finland will also remain warm and moist during the rest of the week, which is an acceptable environment for thunderstorms.
The main focus of the blinds is to be moved from the northern parts of the country to the south on Saturdays and Sundays, where about 2,000 days of lightning can be obtained on Saturdays and Sundays.
In the middle of the country, there is a more uniform Saderland.
According to that kind of Tori, it's only a small amount of thunder.
Coe praises Russia's "public-minded" apology from the Doping scandal.
But Coe added that it was not time to stop the Russian ban on Russian participation.
At the IAAF Congress on Thursday, the Russian General Sports Director, Dmitri Shhjattin, said that the World Trade Organization, on Thursday, said that Russia's ban is appropriate and that he will fight determinedly against doping.
He said he was sorry "for all the athletes who were taken in competitions for gold or silver medals."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of continuing the ban. Russia was excluded from the public sports competitions in November 2015 after the WADA report presented evidence of state support for doping in Russia.
"I think his reply today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the journalists.
"The whole Council and Congress welcomed the fact that the Russian Federation of Public Sport admitted that the country had been through difficult times and announced that it would do everything in its power to reorganise its activities."
Coe said that he was "satisfied" as well as that Russia accepted the conditions for deciding the ban.
"I think we had a very constructive day and progress has been made, but the Congress supports the Group's recommendation that it is not time to stop Russia's ban", Coe said.
"We must do everything we can in order to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added".
Nineteen Russian athletes compete with neutral athlete status in the World Sports MM competitions starting on Friday in London. They have met the IAAF strict criteria.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Task Force, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The test is still insufficient and the trained workers who have received the ban will continue to operate freely", he informed the suppliers on Friday after the presentation to the IAAF Council in London.
The company was disappointed by the poor success of the Tom of Finland film film.
The Tom of Finland movie did not have the success that the authors wanted, says Yle.
If they say honestly, I am disappointed that you will admit that the film was produced by the CEO of Helsinki Film Annika Sucksdorfff Ylen in an interview with Ylen.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film received its first evening in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached fair levels of 100 000 viewers, which is a small amount of the film budget, around EUR 5 million, compared with a small number of others.
There is no return to any of this lottery, but it is now important that investors get their own back.
If the movie had been better in the country, they'd already get their money.
Now we have to wait for a little bit of dirt on foreign distributions, Sucksdorfff says.
Tom of Finland is the movie Dome Karukosken is running.
How football's financial rules affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris of Neymar to Paris.
The provisions restricting the use of European football euros do not prevent Neymar from transferring from Spain to France, France, Saint-Germain, which is the most expensive player in the history of football.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by UEFA, a European football regulator, which may prevent teams from participating in a respected Master league.
UEFA introduced the economic rules for a fair game in 2011 and according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without major losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the termination of the Brazilian agreement, and the annual salary of Neymar for the new company will be carried out in ten million dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France has a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying for Neymar's transfer amount and attaching him to its star maps, as the company will fund Qatar's enriched master family with oil.
The associations will be allowed to use large sums of money to purchase players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that football business is not loss-making.
The financial rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of the French French Michel Platin, chosen for the President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former football player, Platini felt that the pursuit of success by debt was a fraud and led to serious problems if banks or owners were in favour of it.
In 2011, the focus of the economic rules for a fair game was shifted from the liabilities of the clubs to the follow-up of their losses.
The change meant that, for the first time in Chelsea, the implementation of the business model used in 2003 was significantly hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, used huge amounts of player purchases and created a global brand.
The current three-year evaluation period of fair game economic rules lasts until 2018, during which the consequences shall not exceed EUR 30 million.
Although Platini had to leave up the functions of the President of UEFA scandalously in 2015, his successor Alexander Cefer also wants to control the reckless use of money by the clubs.
"The rules for fair play are still in place and we will apply them also in the future", Andrea Traverso, responsible for fair game economic rules in UEFA, told the Associated Press news office last week.
Although PSG paid out Neymar for his contract with a lump sum, it may allocate the sum in accounting for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the transfer amount can be recorded at the annual cost of EUR 44,4 million for the next five years.
On the basis of fair game economic rules, the first sanctions in 2014. The biggest sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhab to Manchester City.
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the Society was also ordered to limit the Master's league to 21 players over the period 2014-2015 instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA monitors clubs that may try to circumvent its economic regulations by increasing their income through companies related to ownership of the company.
For example, if a qatar company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal level of the market, UEFA will not calculate the aid as a normal income.
It happened when UEFA decided in 2014 that the aid to PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority was superseded.
It has also been shown that some of Neymar's earnings in PSG could be financed by the charges available from the 2022 football MM Competition Board in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the Board of Arrangements have denied that it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement when it comes to doing the MM Competitions from Neymar.
Due to the past sanctions of the PSG, UEFA will monitor companies more closely to reverse the rules.
The sources in the situation reported on Thursday that UEFA has not negotiated with PSG about Neymar's transfer with Neymar.
Sources gave an interview with the Associated Press News Office on condition that their identity is not revealed because they do not have the authority to discuss the situation in the PSG.
According to the latest published accounts, PSG's net sales for the period 2015 to 2016 amounted to EUR 542.4 million and operating profit to more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last year have not yet been published.
The PSG expects Neymar to arrive to attract new sponsors and increase sales of derivatives and chips.
The follow-up estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % with the Neymar agreement.
Spain, who was clearly upset about the departure of the world's best player, tried to make Neymar's move difficult. It was claimed to break the economic rules of a fair game.
"This is a clear economic case of doping for both the Society and the State," said Javier Tebas, President of Spain, to the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenalin manager Arsene Wenger also reservations about the state financing the football club's activities. Arsenal owns an American sports pot.
"The event is the result of a property that has changed the football operating environment completely over the last 15 years", Wenger said on Thursday.
"It is all possible after the state owns a football team.
There will be so many interests related to the fact that the famous player represents the country."
It is now urgent: the coach of Finnish MM athletes is stuck in Helsinki.
Long jumper Arttu Pajulahti and three-legged coach Kristiina Mäkelä, Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even though he should train sports in the World Sports World Championships in London.
Kristiina Mäkelä may have to compete without his coach’s advice.
The pajulahti will compete tomorrow for a short shower in a cart and Mäkelä on Saturday in a trip to three.
However, coach of the twin, Armenian Ghazaryan has not received a visa from the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the results of the British Embassy.
The coach has a call as a document for the organisers of the World Championships, but that has not been enough to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is the first symptoms of Brexitt, or what, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He's always dealt with visa issues successfully before, but now there's something wrong with him.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sport Federation SUL for years.
It doesn't matter that much.
As long as someone looks at the stadium's step marks, Arttu Pajulahti said about the possible absence of his coach.
MM-Missal for FinlandLondon requires a miracle.
The World Sport World Cup will begin in London on Friday and will last a fair week on Sunday 13 August.
Sports, mountain skiing and hockey are the species to which Finnish pink athletes can be passionately viewed from year to year, whether they are successful or not.
The success of the sportsmen's hearts is measured in medals.
Of course, there are other dimensions.
To a lesser extent, young athletes’ beautiful growth stories of valuable growth are ignored from someone else, in which they are able to mature the performance of the athlete to the level that the adult MM medal is truly possible.
Now there are no such young athletes on the Finnish little MM team, and neither are the comrades.
The World Cup requires a miracle for Finland.
Fortunately, sport’s interest and surprise is that wonders can happen.
It pulls down the TV poles and the glues to watch the races, even though London's measurements are solved due to the time difference, only in the evening.
Of the previous World Cups of Public Sport 2015, Finland received one denssimite.
It was brought by the spear-thrower Tero Pämäki.
The skanks are waiting for a measure of this moment, although others tell us the latest results of him and other throwrs, as well as the fact that the Pämä is being held up in the values of last summer.
Whatever happens to these races, Pämäki will remain a great Finnish sports hero in history.
Access to the final competition or self-recording is an adequate performance for other Finnish athletes in the race.
Hope and believe in Finland's realistic medal hunt for the coming years of universal sport will give good success to young people in international values this summer as well.
The processing of young talent and the financial support for its work are more important than maintaining a small elite population of representation athletes.
Success does not come in a moment, but calls for years of sweaty work on athletes and patience from training as well as on-the-spot athletes.
Finns are also able to appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
I hope that London's races will remain in history for Usai Bolt and Mo Farah, and not for instance because of the fear of terrorism or violent attacks.
Eat Rukajärvi second at the Copper Big Fair, "But it's too bad."
Snowboarder Enni Rukajärvi is located in the second big air race in U.S. Colorado.
The second-sixer on the Copper Mountain is Rukajärve's best Big Air World Cup.
The women's race won the United States Jamie Anderson.
The food lake collected 147 points in the race.
For the first time, he tried to take his last jump at the camper's 1080s, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and a good guy is now, but I'm afraid the last jump didn't go quite right.
I'm going to try it again, but I'm going to try it again from now on.
In big air for snowboarding, a competitor jumps out of a jumper made for a species.
Viking Line's new fast-starting ship to the port of Helsinki in Helsinki.
The backup company Viking's new fast-ship FSTR is very late for the schedule.
The long-ship had to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6 p.m.
The ship was loaded in eight countries.
The ship came to Helsinki already late.
For at least an hour and a half, I've been waiting for you to get on board.
Now the car line is moving a bit, the Estonianman waiting for access to the ship at Helsinki Port, Johannes Rebane told us at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had become a technical fault.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought into the ship access bottles of water waiting for their cars.
Viking Communication Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there was a technical error.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a couple hours late.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be delayed from Tallinn's return trip for a few hours.
The ship was supposed to go back from Tallinn to Helsinki at 20.15 p.m.

Small circle nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Dective
At the same time, both the days of the 80s and the 90s grunge (at that time David Wain and Michael Showalter made a great show for The State on MTV) and their own time – 2001 – before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things.
As a cultural product, it is both a parodia and a description of the continuous reminder that we have been stuck in during the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it seems like it's been a long time ago.
The First Day of Camp was surprisingly well, and not just because of its absurd humor (including the background story of the vegetables of H. Jon Benjamin's voice).
The essence of Vits is that middle-aged actors are acting like a desire for a full-life life, and emphasising it makes it impossible to reach the past a part of a joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults act as adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: it parodys, for example, 90s of the world's football clubs, such as the horror film Hand who spins the clock.
In one of the characters dig up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and "other stuff from 1991".
Many stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has still not made it over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And a mad run involves Ronald Reagan (a man named Michael Showalter) as a criminal partner of George H H. W. Bush (who is well played by Michael Ian Black).
As always in such series, the best are sidelines.
It's a very special fun to see the junior Paul Rudd, who's got a rumor under the floor of a beardup, or Matt Dillon's "soul patch" movie from Singles. Rudd's acting Andy, camp shoes, starts to be an old man already.
The moments of random madness may take this series up as a sort of recursive Seven Up! series until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Tweet Years Later. At its last scene, the team goes to the Wet Hot American Summer film first night.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series once again appeals to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans series of cold war, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series, where you will meet the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has been led by Rhys Thomas. It has been made a Romanian police drama in the 1980s, where the Hungarian coper fights for truth, atheism and Marxism.
The main hard-faced Gregorina and idealist Iosefina are seen by Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their turn in English has been done by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a great idea,
But much more than that, it's not.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police spend time watching TV chess in the same way that Americans watch football).
There are a bunch of famous composers, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahersala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, who will make them a fun game.
However, Comrade Dective remains too attached to tracking the socialist drama of the clumsy – a killer hiding behind Reagan's mask, which is why the series is often starting to feel like a clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough and not rich.
The series might work better as an agitprop-satiori, even if Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the US Embassy and the lobby there are always two fat men who are suffocating burgers.
The message to the imaginary Communist public is that Western culture can make all the consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: our group toured our respective history and their history as well.
Kuuvolian Toni Tauru will rise up in the ring in Macao on Saturday before a former UFC counterer.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the match up.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone in Macao, as Issa, a Brazilian Leandro Issa, was at the UFC organization last year.
The Brazilian also has a juju black belt and a world champion of the species.
For once I take myself against my parents.
That's a funny thing, 32-year-old Tauru says.
A couper had to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The fight was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were made on a speeding schedule for the Chinese self-government region in Macao.
The walnut has never seen such a thing before.
This was the first time my match was canceled.
It made me nervous because preparing and training took a long time.
However, the fight is pleased that a new time has come for the struggle.
The waiting of a week does not seem to affect the preparation of the week.
The transfer doesn't work out because it won't be immediate a week.
You can get worse if you practice too much now.
In some of the previous struggles, the walrus has faced opponents whose strengths are in the ability to fight.
This time, the situation is different.
Oh, my God, the Kouvolian describes himself as a typical Brazilian.
He's quite aggressive.
I'll bet he comes on first round and try to take me to the mat.
He's won the granddad of the world, so he knows how to move.
The last game of the Cupulian was not going according to the plans.
The Philippines, Kevin Belingon, hit TUURA badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never been that close before: he never got a hit at all.
I went to pour, and he hit my eyeball.
It's been a long time.
New motivation.
Some freelancers take one year, part rises more often in the circle.
For example, the future opponent Issa took the previous time in September.
There were three matches last year on the tour.
Now there is a second year's struggle ahead.
Sometimes I've been pregnant.
I've been working out in recent years and I've been in good shape all the time.
But all I've been doing is fighting.
When a 32-year-old heard about the future scene, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was in Espoo training and I got the joy of doing it back.
We got really good training when we got one of the guys from Sweden, too.
Training was a great help, since on Saturday the Kouvolan has to be prepared for physical struggle.
I've been trained against opponents of the same size, and I've been trained to fight in a contest.
Well, it's a 32-year-old head tactics.
You have to be reasonable.
If there's a chance, I'll take the land myself.
You can't give your discounts for free, because they consume the most.
Macao attracts TUUR in China before.
I hear it's China's Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and great dinner in front of you.
The central bank of central bank maintains interest rates at 0.25% of GDP at 0.25%.
The central bank is expected to report that it will maintain interest rates at the same time as economic growth has been put an end to speculation.
The central bank of England has warned that economic growth is slowing down, and that the bank has moved interest payments because more pressure on the income level of families is taking place.
The decision-makers of the monetary policy committee of the Central Bank decided to maintain interest rates of 0,25%, with less support this month, given that economic growth has been unpopular.
In its quarterly inflation review, the bank decreased to 1.7% in 2017 and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%, and it also warned us that more pressure would be placed on households' income levels, as inflation is expected to continue to rise by nearly three per cent in autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest payments are needed in the coming years to contain the inflation rate accelerated by Brexit, and the bank also announced that the loan costs may have to be increased more than expected on the financial markets.
In addition, the members of the Committee decided to withdraw part of the massive package of economics which began to be carried out one year ago in the post-employment of the Brexit national referendum.
The Bank will end the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is now expected to provide affordable financing to banks through the programme to a total of GBP 15 million, of a total of EUR 115 million.
The minutes of the Bank's interest rate report state that: "The forecast of the Committee responsible for Financial Policy is that the slow trend in GDP will continue in the coming years when the decline in real incomes of households will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank reiterated the need for a "lower scale" of market expectations in order to reduce inflation.
The market currently predicts the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second in 2020.
However, the bank pointed out that the potential increases are "several" and "limited".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9 per cent for this year and an increase of 1.7 per cent for the next year.
It now held its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8 per cent.
In relation to the dollar and the euro, the pump deteriorated as a result of the news.
Compared to the dollar, the figure decreased by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31. In relation to the euro, it decreased by 0.4 per cent and was EUR 1,11 per cent.
The decision to maintain interest rates was made unchanged after the expected lower growth rates fell by an increase in the expectations of interest rates. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but it will be slightly more pronounced at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review only gave little hope of rising inflation and low wage increases for households, and according to the bank, the situation will deteriorate even before it becomes better.
The bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" from falling revenue in the coming years, but it expects wage developments to "preferably" at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also strengthen the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of weak prices, which will reverse part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was taken one year after the interest rates were calculated at 0.25% as a shock after the outcome of the EU referendum, which fell to a fall in pounds.
The Bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision will likely begin to be reflected in prices and in the economy only after four years.
Prior to the latest decision of the central bank, interest payments had started to be made more and more loudly when inflation was tightening the pressure on households, and in July the three decision-makers called for a 0.5 % interest rate increase in July.
Over the last month, inflation increased to 2.6 per cent from 2.9% in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation was again tightening over the coming months.
According to the bank, the overrun of its 2% target was due to the "total" weak weight.
"In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the competition in the housing market seems to be becoming even more intense when creditors are looking for customers and want to end up strongly for a year," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Montlake, who is the director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Markets look particularly good to those whose current loan agreement is about to be concluded. The renewal agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low, and they also offer unnecessary alternatives."
NHS prescribes 10,000 anti-disputable HIV medicines to treat HIV.
From September to September, patients can be prescribed a "reversible" HIV prevention medicine. The Supreme Court completed a dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the English public health care system (NHS).
NHS announced that PrEP prescribed approximately 10 000 people during the first three-year trial. It has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% at high risk for individuals before being associated with this medicinal product.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court's court's jurisdiction was in place for the last year of the Supreme Court, according to which NHS was able to pay the PEP, even though it claimed that local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, Director of the United Kingdom NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday to be "a major new intervention", and the National AIDS Organization described it as "an important moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to receive admissions to an experiment extending in October to other clinics. Try to reach the full extent of England by April 2018.
Pre-reporting prevention (PrEP) must be taken before co-administered with an HIV medicine that reduces the risk of infection.
Experience has shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV exposure in risk groups.
A preventive medicinal product means that there are sufficient substances in the body during contact with the body that prevent HIV infection.
You can take your medicine every day or two hours before you have sex.
The target group includes gay men, bisexual men and trans-sexuals as well as people with HIV-positive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
The clinics select the conditions for the experiment, which meet the conditions for applicants from men, women and trans-sex and those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and reporting to general health professionals can also apply for a trial at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds, and this week the UK NHS signed a contract contract for medicinal products after an international invitation to tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of PEP by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its application, intake and implementation.
"This significant new intervention should complement and enhance the existing diverse and increasingly effective means of preventing HIV," says Stevens.
"That is another remarkable achievement in the fight that has been going on for more than 30 years in order to resolve the greatest health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, Director of the National AIDS Organisation.
"If PrEP is applied correctly to those who need it and those who are at risk, it may have a reverse effect on the HIV epidemic of England.
As of September, the risk group will receive a medicinal product financed by the NHS, which they can decide on independently without need to negotiate with the partner. It will have an effective effect, which will have to improve the lives of a very many people.
This was welcome news."
"Now it is most important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no member of the risk group is excluded from it," says Ian Green, Director of the Terrence Higgins Foundation.
"The PEP has been obtained and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people from HIV infection."
"The start of the PEP trial is a welcome event that has been prolonged to no avail in several months due to the slowdown of the government," says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the shadow government.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reverse effect on our jobs that we are doing to prevent HIV and stop spreading this threatening disease.
It helps us to understand better the real benefits of PEP.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect the risks of HIV and get another step closer to the situation where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of living: intermediate and smart decoration solutions have made a small home from Earl's Court's apartment.
Former banker Joanne printh, who was in the building building repair, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller apartment in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's age style house. The success of the Remont tells us that Joanne hasn't packed her hair yet and changed her hair.
"This time I used to live with my ex in a significantly larger apartment in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something similar in my price class.
I went to this flat room and found that the rooms were as high as in my apartment like that.
"I fell right down and made a deal on the same day."
Since then, about 90 square meters of apartment has experienced a complete change of shape.
It was a twin where only the bedroom got out of the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor to get the room height used.
"I wanted space, big windows and a lot of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad to work at the Duck & Shed Design Office in Notting Hill. Erfan was able to make use of the space of almost four meters tall rooms and to create a dwelling that would not just be a place to repair and sell but a home.
The height of the room was not enough for two double spaces, so the challenge was to build a middle floor where it was able to stand.
The solution called for creative thinking from Erfan.
"The mass structure is pretty complicated.
The facilities had to be set up so that they don't need to have a tear on them.
The structures had to be modified so that the height is just right above and below them."
Erfan was able to invest more than two full heights of room with fascinating details.
The copper-style window of Retrouvius opens on the middle floor into a stylish living space.
The hidden furniture, silver effects and the vintage lamps of Serge Mouille create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings with it theatricality, sensation and light of the condition.
The mirrors on each side of the short corridor are allowed to influence the corridor beyond what is real.
The mirror in the kitchen compartment is like a window that opens the view to another room.
The mirror furniture at the entrance has a storage room for Joanne's meals and glassware.
More integrity is that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens equipped with a roof door are not a new solution,
But in Joanne's kitchen, it is unique that the door is raised the same way as the garage door.
"It needed a little design", Erfan says about a steel-cold MDF door.
"It is balanced, i.e. it slides when rising very easily."
As a result of prudent space use and storage planning, Joanne received 16 extra squares, the second bedroom and the better groundline.
"When selling the property, the area will be resolved – or the property appreciation," Erfan says.
"In the event of default, the real estate broker walks into the apartment and lowers the price by surface area."
In Joanne's apartment, the area was increased by using high-quality materials that provide luxury space.
"It is in contact with the materials of the apartment, and the tunnels in the apartment are partly based on them," says Erfan.
"No one climbs into the electrical wires running in the walls.
They are important too, but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good design and additional services can make a basic dwelling extraordinarily fine.
It may also happen that you don't want to move out of your apartment anymore.

In the summer of 1996, home appeared on the Gulf Square where Thai food was sold.
The ladies didn't want to taste it, they walked past it.
At home, food was sold by Panya Sumsri-Penttilä, familiar with Panja.
He did not know much about Finland, and the Finns did not yet know Thai at that time.
Because people didn't want to go to dinner, Panja offered free corn.
So he taught the L.A. to eat Thai food at one time.
From the country, he said.
I got stuck in a bag.
I went more and more often, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened its Thai-food sector in the Gulf Chamber.
There were two small tables, I think the customers were under 20.
He taught us not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to the guest of the knife.
When hungry and restricted, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and the guest.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I was sitting at the board with the dictionary to study in Thai.
Two years went by the shop hall, but then the restaurant was supposed to be moved because the spice gloves made themselves, they said they'd smell too much in the hall.
A new location was released from the commercial government's head.
There's room for room.
Now we jurors will be able to sit in our own tables again, only in times of congestion, we will be able to ask the guests if there is room next to them.
Panja knows his client.
They'll tell him where he's been and who he's seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He's seen how the customer's life stages vary and the food supply changes.
He remembers what kind of guy I went to eat for my first cook.
He remembers me thin and fat, and remembers what I was when I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little bit later than the rest of us, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door and change your membership with Panja, who's in the dishes.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chilik sauce.
In addition to our taste, he has opened up our thoughts and hearts.
Today, many people talk to him Thai - thank you for the increased popularity of tourism.
I admire Panya.
Even though she's been having a hard time, she's always friendly.
He's hard.
He's going to go to the restaurant, and he's going to go to mushrooms and gypsy.
Last week at the restaurant, we had a wedding party of two decades of fulfillment.
We've got our customers some corn cake for dessert.
Without alarm or attention, this significant day went by work.
The finding of the underground base revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to attack Europe.
From the start of the year, the safety authorities received a significant list for their work on counter-terrorism.
This list contains more than 170 data from Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German Die Welt magazine, there are 173 individuals in total, and the document includes their personal data in addition to the pictures of each person.
More than 130 of these persons are Iraqis, but six Europeans are also involved.
They are from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The rest are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tajikistan and Saudi Arabia.
The night Sanomat told me about the list and a couple of weeks ago.
Now the location of the list and its contents have been revised.
According to the newspaper, Iraq's military Special Forces found a list of terrorist personal data and photos that included a list of the terrorists in the investigation of the terrorist organization's underground base in Mosul, Mosul.
The U.S. intelligence officers evaluated the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
This list was distributed by Interpol to all safety authorities in European countries in May.
The background was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in Western countries by terrorists after the fall of Daddy in the Middle East.
According to Welt, the list includes not only the names and images of all persons but also their date of birth, their inventions and information about the person's country of residence.
The list also includes special terrorist specialities.
For example, on the list of German 27-year-old Sami J. reads as Abu Assid al-Alman, German.
It is reported that he left Germany in 2012 traveling first to Egypt, then Libya and later Turkey through Syria to join the Isis rows.
A specialty suicide bomber is written next to his picture.
There's no more accurate information on the man's fate.
In Europe, some 6,000 fighters have left Isisi in total, with no certainty of fate.
The man fell below the surface in the Tocoinrak in Helsinki.
According to the rescue service interviews, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.
Even a bucket can save the life of death.
A person who was under water was saved in the Tocoinara on Thursday.
According to Ville Estlander, the head-to-head firemaster of the Helsinki Rescue Centre said that the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The lifeguard diver found him under the surface, Estlander tells us.
The insurance undertaking received a notification half-after four in the afternoon.
The staff were sent to the hands of the first treatment.
Estlander says it was a man of about 50 years old.
According to the interviews, a man had wanted to show that he could swim.
The situation in Tocoinra is already over.
Estlander congratulates the authorities on their cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
It was the task of the Border Guard Agency.
The locals also gave excellent guidance to the divers.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars hit nine people in Eura's cars, three seriously injured.
There were nine people in the car, the rest of which were hit by lower injuries, reports the sun-friend firefighter.
Among those who were injured, there are both men and women.
The accident occurred at a three-way intersection at four o’clock a day.
The accident happened when the other car turned the warning triangle to guarantee the second car, says the main firefighter.
According to the restraint, there is a maximum speed limit of 80 km per hour in the cruise area.
Brothers fight more than $ 500 million of real estate assets worth more than $ 500 million.
Two of the brothers argue with Victoria's biggest real estate business worth over $500 million, which involves their Italian family 40 years ago to set up a family business.
Colin De Lutis, president of the former Carlton football club and real estate developer, lives in the area of Torahak, only three houses from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the Supreme Court of Justice for the distribution of real estate and business property between brothers and sisters.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute between the divorce and the divorce.
The brothers and their mother Anna together own 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars. The family began to gain property when they bought a Collingwood Smith Street street store in 1973.
The family was founded there by the Westco Jeans store, which expanded to 160 stores into a chain of chains.
The market was sold on the market by $85 million in 1999.
The money was used in real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorreto and apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as suburban shopping centres.
According to the agreement concluded with the late father of the family, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's wealth, and Paul owns about one-third of the company's wealth.
According to the law, the share ratio of assets means that Colin owns real estate worth approximately EUR 316 million and Paul value about $1 176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the distribution of real estate and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn proof of justice in 2015.
The case was dealt with for the first time last Friday in the Supreme Court after several mediation companies.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has shut him out of business.
Colin claims it's not true, and he's accusing Paul of mistreatment of some properties.
Colin writes in one of his first juror proofs that he would like to reach a decision on the matter.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is important to me", Colin says in his opinion.
There are hundreds of statements, e-mails and reports on this case. The case is being discussed by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who set up milk bars and treats in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s they bought a trade from Brunswick.
They were used as a insurance policy when the family bought a real estate from Collingwood where Colin set up the family's first farce store.
Colin says that he has established a trade "in the last few years when Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and her dead Luigi in 2012 wanted to transfer properties to their boys in agreement.
"A lot of people said that they don't want brothers to come to trial," says Anna in her statement.
Two other boys from the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group, according to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when he left the company.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark are "the continuous departure from their financial terms".
Colin's been keeping a low profile, although he was a former member of the Australian football league board and TV star, Eddie McGuire's best friend, according to this biography that appeared in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied, and he told me in his text message that you cannot comment on it because it is dealt with in court.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family's name to the trial," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother’s demands.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted us to fight like this", Colin continued and told me that he wanted us to continue to hope that we could find a solution.
On Friday the hope seemed to have gone out.
"We're going to settle in court in the near future", Colin wrote.
The new Chief of Staff of the Trump will limit the president's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will finally succeed.
First.
According to the Poltico newspaper, the new Chief of Staff of the White House intends to limit the media usage and follow-up of President Trump's press so that the boss does not get so often in trouble.
Journalist Josh Dawsey reporting:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Head of Staff of the White House, met with the management staff on his first working day, he spoke about the key problem he intends to solve: he intends to limit President Donald Trump's information on his behalf.
Kelly told the workers in the White House that all information, both printed and heard at the media, must be carried through her because the President makes better decisions when you get good information."
Kelly's words make sense, but others have tried to limit the media usage of Trump and failed.
President Trump has a decade relationship with television — and as President he continues to watch a lot of television.
"If the President-in-Office Trump was nervous about the unfair news, he was encouraged to see that the media were more balanced about things", Sam Nunberg, who was working as advisor in the Trump campaign, told the Politico newspaper in February.
Politician supplier Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "the six former campaign workers believe it is essential that his personal media stream is a smooth flow of cables".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to say that the use of Trump Twitter has never been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don't know – perhaps the Trump's Twits would have been even worse without their efforts.
We probably never know what kind of messages Trump missed.
If his staff had at least a few times been able to stop him from causing problems, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from causing the attack.
It is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to drive their case by providing information that supports their views. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that counsellors would deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
Editor Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
“Trump’s current and former workers say that he can get a hell of a lot of anger from the magazines in which he is criticised — especially when they tell about harmful data flows, and that is when he has to know where the data comes from.
That was at the end of February when someone brutally gave the President a copy of the news of GotNews.com website, founded by a online provocator Charles C. Johnson, who was accused of several data leaks in the White House.
Johnson had been permanently removed from Twitter for harassment, and he had previously distributed false charges and withdrawn them later. He also did not provide concrete evidence.
Nevertheless, after reading the story, Trump had begun to ask the staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then the Chief of Staff of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of Staff of the White House Rob Porter " had tried to introduce a system of management of documents going to Trump".
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants are still driving their own affairs.
These unchanged facts make Kelly very difficult to perform.

Author Raija Oranen explained alcoholism and flight fear with hypnosis: "I'm fine with my life"
From the Tv series, Ruusu's time and Pure white sheets are famous successful writer Raija Orange has just spent his 69th anniversary.
The hypnosis helped Raija Orasta.
Five grandchildren hold grandmas so much as to take away from writing that Rahija and his husband, Jyrki, gave up the Spanish sun and the Fuengirola's apartment after 18 winter.
First they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left for rent.
The light and the sun, out of the old circles, Raidi used to take depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
The external nature is also 20 kg lighter.
The weight went down when the serotonin was stopped, they were anti-epileptics.
Alcoholism helped me once with hypnosis, which also worked on an airplane, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol takes a person, the milky writer says openly.
Rajija and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same route for more than 45 years.
It's better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen, who has worked in the tourism sector, has been working together for more than 40 years.
I proposed, and it was getting married two weeks ago, Raji laughing.
She's always been a drama queen, and she's stopped living that way, and Jyrki's laughing at her wife.
Orane, the author of a beautiful book career, only remembers the good 44th pure white sheets on the TV series, which touched and moved the Laman-era Finland.
I finally decided to be the industry of Raikka’s family company in the clothing industry when I was reading the 50th anniversary of Liisa Seppälä on a plane.
I was the daughter of a seamer, my mother also had a clothing shop, and sometimes I act like mannequin, Oranen remembers.
He said that a series of plots and stories changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savean's research and the argument revealed, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen lives as a writer for active time, he has many manuscripts under the work - ideas hundreds of times.
The circlers returned to the pool over the "millimeter alley"
The most wealthy houseowners in West Midlands are once again with the self-sufficient circulars who managed to cross the municipality's long-awaited edge and return to the next field of the houses.
The circulars parked twenty wagons near Solihu, a street called the alley of the millionaires.
They were driven out of the area in May but managed to cross the flagrant of the municipality for the journey, and they brought with them children, horses, and the army of vans.
The tourers managed to cross the transit barrier at a point that was left unprotected by the path.
The loved ones have accused the municipality of Solihull's "full inability to solve the problem".
The anonymous resident tells us that the circulars arrived on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passersbys with rocks.
"When you have to be hard to act, because it seems to be completely incapable of solving the problem.
The tourers were here in May, then they left but returned again.
They came in tonight more and probably even more today."
The resident said that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by prohibiting access to parks.
"As far as Streetsbrook Road is concerned, and it is frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it."
According to the second anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the Turks returned so soon after they were driven away.
"They've been more than ever, and they've even counted the horse to land in the park."
According to the informor of the municipality of Solihull, the municipality is aware of illegal camping near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal measures with the Solihull police to get out of camp as soon as possible.
For the purpose of collecting evidence, it is essential that as many local authorities as possible report to the police about interference or criminal activity.
It helps to form a whole picture of the situation in the case."
The people who were looted were surrounded by Portugal’s corrupt machine.
In Portugal, men who have been forced to take on a beach full of people have been interviewed in court today.
Two people died yesterday following the forced landing.
Two men flying a plane can be charged with a death sentence.
At least it can give us 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
A small plane flying by men had to make a forced landing yesterday on the shores of Sao Joao da caparica, near Lisbon, due to technical error.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time of the event, some of which ran off a landing machine to escape into water.
The machine hit a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died instantly.
The machine first hit the guy who was on the back of the machine.
Right after that, the plane rose up and when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told the Philippines Janeira Jornal de Noticias magazine on the beach.
The little girl who died was on the beach with her parents.
The girl's parents weren't hurt.
On the beach, the people surrounded the little machine immediately after the breakup, angry at me.
The girl's father and other people went to the plane and started beating it up, told us about the case in the Celia Rocha Correio da Manha magazine.
The man called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a miracle that no more people are dead.
The two men on the plane didn't get hurt in the crash.
A tragicly lost Finnish leader won again from the World Cup: "I would not be world champion"
Matti Nagy-Hamari celebrates early Wednesday morning Finnish time MM-gold banks in the slides in the Canadian Big White competition.
The Great Hamari won the cross MM-kule before in the competitions.
All of a sudden, three of the MM-telets have already been accumulated.
Can't believe the World Cups.
Two times was treated with a pretty good heart beat, the Great-Hamari, the goal of the phone, was delighted.
A 30-year-old invoicer thanked his coach and very successful preparation in Finland.
According to Greatham, the number of interviews in the species is growing all the time.
The whole parade has grown and has developed quite a lot recently.
The differences are reduced, and there are a lot of new calculates involved.
Always wondering if there's a black horse coming after you.
Each race seems to have a different winner.
Big Hamri lost his other foot in a motorcycle accident in 2009 in 2009.
He had been eager to count from a young age with his friends, and the accident did not take the desire to get in the chest.
I wonder what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that there is no reason to be in vain.
They play on those cards, which are divided, Big Hamari emphasizes.
It would be cruel to get you into a serious accident and lose the waste to be a lucky shot, and Big-Hamari won't do it either.
But he turned it into a horrific spirit.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to be a success.
I wouldn't be the three-time world champion without an accident.
Before the accident, the 23-year-old Big-Hamar's largest cruise was already floating.
The Danube towards the peak went off to the real thing only after the accident.
When I was young, I used to work with my friends, and we used to kill our excited X-Games.
But they were distant wounds that evaporated over time.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere in the X-Games launch.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old, and I was wondering if this would be a really long life if I stayed here to be bitter and miserable.
I decided to pull the hammers in my neck and get to work.
I'd say I've done pretty well.
The reader was very pleased with the choice of the Leo-Pekka Star as a year athlete.
A simple Olympic winner received his prize in a sports gala held in January.
According to Greatham, star victory is an important signal for the parasitic population.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely earned.
I'm sure this will also open your eyes to the world of parasports.
When is it time to launch a double world champion Matti Great-Hamar's annual athlete campaign?
We'll see about that in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Today, Great Hamari has not dominated all the peaks that he has desired.
Next year, here's the big goal.
A year later, Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
Let's go get some medals.
The majority of Syrian refugee young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will permanently return to their country of origin, unless the war ends and the country of Isis is from the country of origin.
A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges survey examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees bake bread on refugee camp in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return permanently to their homeland.
They believe that the end of the war on Syria and the departure of Daddy from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their homeland.
The Trump administration sees no change in the conflict in Syria.
The communication office chain Burson-Marsteller explained the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
In nine years, Mr.boson-Marsteller has already examined the views and attitudes of arabinurten.
This year's study A Voice for Young Syrian Refuges examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey replied in February-March 2017 to a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half men.
Half of the interviews were held in Jordan and Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of young Syrian refugees believe that they will never return to their homeland permanently in the future.
42 per cent of respondents may think they will return to their own country and 4 per cent could not say.
According to the survey, the home return of young people is the most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Daddy in the country.
Almost half (47%) consider the end of the war to be the most impressive factor in the permanent return to home, whereas the fourth considers that the main priority would be to leave the country.
Only a third of them will make the most of the most important factors to make it more effective than the improvement in the economic situation or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military action alone does not resolve the conflict.
The Syrians were asked what was the main factor in determining the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad from power.
A fair quarter considers the President of Al-Assad as an obstacle to the peace treaty.
Almost half of the evidence is that both political and military solutions are needed to end the current conflict in Syria.
The resolution of the conflict by military means alone does not believe as a fair quarter.
The majority of Syrian refugees sees Isisi's power deteriorated over the past year, while the fifth experiences its power strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing about fighting against the people is that the media would provide people with information that Isaac has nothing to do with Islamius.
Almost as many of them raised the priority of military measures as well as educational reform.
In the opinion of the 10th fair, the most important thing would be to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asking for the impact of the Trump administration on the Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost one in four believes that the Syrian conflict is becoming worse during the period of Trump.
Opinions are divided into two aspects as to whether Russia and Iran's participation has improved or deteriorated the conflict.
Monty Widenius spends half his time encoding to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed is used, for example, Wikipedia and Google.
The Espoo business MariaDB develops the "most rapidly growing" open source database for open source sources in the world.
Michael "Monty" Widenius's main product does not pay users any money at all, and it can be developed via the Internet by any host programmer.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but paying customers may not be.
With the help of databases, huge data mass mass is kept in order and rapidly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the pictures are linked there," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the CEO of MariaDB, spends about half his time coded.
A beautiful man who does distances by his hand will help to ensure that the Internet works smoothly.
Widenius developed the world's most popular open source database MySQL together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the Technology Company Sun bought MySQL for a billion dollars, and one year later, the software left Oracle in your greed with Sun’s 7.4 billion dollars.
When the Oracle store happened, a large part of MySQL developers reported they were leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not give a sure promise of MySQL's future," Widenius recalls.
He had already set up a company that started developing MariaDB at this stage.
He didn't want his life's work to die.
I hired the twenty best developers from Sun, so I made sure that the code's continuity is secured with the same guys that created it.
As MySQL is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch of its own.
The name was just supposed to change.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom to monitor the development of the MariaDB code.
"In mySQL, these verifications were not made," Widenius is troubled.
Although many have heard about Widenius and MySQL billion, Finnishs rarely know anything about MariaDB.
"The last few years of our growth rate has been around 50% per year", says Kennedy Paqvalen, Director General of MariaDB.
The growth-focused MariaDB does not yet make a profit, and Paqvalén is a sleek word for the company's class.
To that extent, he reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that he will receive EUR 20 million of orders for the current financial year.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it for which business customers are prepared to pay for.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which can be more than a year's career if the customer has used a closed database.
The exchange of MySQL to MariaDB can be done at the moment, because they are versions of each other.
Amongst other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia DBS are customers paying for MariaDB.
The most recent cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azeure, Alibaban Cloud, offer their customers MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB will automatically spread to new users in distribution packages for Linux operating systems, where MaryDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Although we're a small company, we have connections with the biggest games we've ever had.
"Our customers include the world's largest teleoperators, gambling companies, banks and even a single central bank", Paqvalén's list.
There are still giants such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oracle MySQL is a modest by-product compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although Gartner, according to the research firm Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their market share over recent years, in turnover, games such as MariaDB are still insignificant, even though rapidly growing seals are growing.
About USD 50 billion in the database market, open source databases are not even going to reach a billion.
However, the value of the open source code cannot be measured only in the money because most users do not pay for any of this software.
The Company Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already develop more than 70% of their internal applications on open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would at that time have been replaced to open or at least started the transition.
Large companies do not receive new customers, as the majority chooses the next open source code.
This has led to the drop in the cloud of licence fees for commercial databases.
The companies want to make as much money as before with a smaller number of customers", Widenius wonders.
Since the exchange of closed databases is poor, most of the customers have carefully absorbed price increases.
"There are many customers to whom it is very difficult to move to because their old applications and others are closed in the database", Widenius says.
He still believes that the customer's measure is coming up.
When licence fees rise every year, the customer will move sooner or later to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent from the previous year, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
In addition, many companies are facing major changes in their system when they move their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchanges of database software.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
It was the largest growth funding ever provided by the EIB to the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide and is intended to employ more now.
One of the reasons behind EIB’s funding was the impact of the MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public sector customers, for example, in the UK and Germany.
The public sector in Europe spends billions of euros annually on databases.
"To many countries want to move to open source solutions and use tax money more efficiently," says Paqvalén.
Widenius is concerned about how money in Finland is spent on closed healthcare systems, even when open systems are cheaper, and there is no subscriber at the mercy of a single software company.
Some say the open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to make the code.
The community will help and do something that cannot itself be invented or done.
The 55-year-old Widenius belongs to another Finnish Linux developer Linus Torvalds, along with the most well-known open source promoters.
Widenius will help other companies to develop operational business models on open source code.
I still hold 4-5 speeches annually around the world on this subject.
Italy makes its attitude towards civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil civil protection contributions Italy strengthens its strong attitude towards the civil civil protection contributions of NGOs. Italy
Italy has warned NGOs that, on their ships, will save refugees in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to operate unless they undertake to comply with new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs do not commit themselves to the new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue", Minister of State Marco Minniti said in the hearing of the Turinn La Stampa newspaper.
Minnit's warning came from a day after the Italian authorities had imprisoned the German Jugend Rettet Support Organisation, which its crew is suspected to have worked with the traffickers of human beings who promoted illegal immigration.
For a year, a non-governmental organisation that operated for only one year refused to comment on the detailed accusations of the Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"To us saving lives is and will be the most important thing. We are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue area", the organization announced in its opinion published in social media.
"We can only assess the accusations after we have gathered all the necessary information and we can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had observed the Iuventa Platform of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of taking on board a boat by boatmen refugees directly from human hauliers who reintroduced the ships.
One of these cases is alleged to have occurred just a few kilometers from the coast of Libya.
The crew is suspected of being attacked by the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the area, which is considered a motive for assistance in the area.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Iuventa should be accompanied by an Italian police officer who monitors the operation.
Only three nine NGOs participating in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which announced on Thursday that they would consider new rules unnecessary but acceptable, as they do not create "markable changes or obstacles" for the survival of the organisation.
Among those who have refused to comply with these instructions are Nobel awarded Doctors without borders organization.
On the other hand, Minniti noted that the number of migrants arriving in Italy by means of rescue measures has fallen strongly over the last few weeks, as demonstrated by the fact that actions to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with local mayors will begin to produce results.
"In the last days, light has begun to appear at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He revealed that it was planned to continue discussions this month with the Libyan mayors on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali to reduce the number of refugees heading towards Europe.
A seasonal worker's suspected suspect was suspected that he was killed in Enontekiö, a suspect was found in the country - a case to the prosecutor.
The suspected crime occurred last December at Enontekio Kõtse last December.
According to the police, a 36-year-old man from Czech was suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish avalanche.
In the past, it has been reported that both were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that the suspect would have escaped with two dogs to the ground after he did it.
The man was found cold on the ground, and he did not resist when he was caught.
We'll have to press charges in less than a week.
It may be possible to put the case down in Lapland’s tip right still in August.
Robert Hardy, who is known for Harry Potter and all- My dearestestest friend series, is dead.
The British actor Robert Hardy died when he was 91 years old.
On Thursday, this family announced the death of an actor.
Hardy, born 1925, started his acting career at the theater when he was 24 years old.
During his long career, he was also acting on movies and television.
Hardy is especially reminded of the role of Minister of Magic Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter movies as well as his veterinary role in the All-haired My Friends TV series based on James Herriot's book.
The BBC's favorite series was taken across seven times.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to imprisonment for the text messages that encouraged him suicide of suicide in a prison prison of text messages that encouraged his suicide of suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that were considered to have encouraged her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20 is going to execute 15 months of his sentence in prison and five years in parole.
Carter was sentenced to death in June, and her boyfriend Conrad Roy committed suicide on 13.7.2014.
"My family's broken", Conrad's father said on Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter applied for an appeal against the judgment and was expected to wait for the application to be processed in freedom.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy were suffering from mental health problems.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream-colored puberty, listened to the hands of his judgment on the cross with a weeping look on the ground created.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor said to the court.
"He chose Conrad's life to heal his own.
He has not taken any responsibility," the DA continued.
"He has not shown repentance."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by the "intelligent circumstances that Carter deeply regret".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity" and even the mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions".
The D.A. read from Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement that she said, "It's not gonna take a day to say that I didn't die the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm going to deal with all this, and I'm trying best to comfort his sisters in this pain that we will always bear."
Conrad's sister Camdy's Roy told the court that she was "mad" about the idea that she would never see her brother's wedding and that she would never be aunt to her children.
"It's painful to lose a person who's been in my life every day since I was born, and that pain never makes me feel better", Camdy said.
The case appears to be a precedent, since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that intimidating suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car in an incinerator poisoning when he died in 2014.
The case drew national attention to the fact that Carter had in her texting had encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide.
"Stand yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself. I don't know how there are many ways", Carter wrote in many messages he had sent Roy over the two weeks before this death. Roy was on vacation with his family at the time.
Just a little before Roy's suicide Carter wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention on Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by giving interviews.
The case has shared experts' opinions.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 convicted of the murder of his British roommates in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion saying, "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
NATO Secretary-General: You are Russia's worst since the cold war.
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commenting by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think I can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we were hoping that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and in view of the continued instability in Russia's eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting so that the tensions do not tighten to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an increase in the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stiltenberg's comments on the U.S. President Donald Trump made it possible for the United States and Russia to reach a dangerously poor level.
Trump urged the country's poor-interested Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
The Audio makes changes to 850 000 diesel engines due to a re-regivuation of the experience experienced by car manufacturers due to a reaction of 850,000 diesel motor motor motor motor car manufacturers.
The day before the Audio announcement, BMW offered to update over 350 000 car software.
The director of the BMW said that the company believed that "there are more rational options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including the home city of BMW, Munich, which consider restricting or prohibiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that he would make changes to more than three million Mercedes engines in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies were talking about a call for back.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to meet the CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen emissions from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emissions neutralising equipment will increase, when cars will be difficult to price competitively.
German car manufacturers are closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkeli has been accused of co-existing and avoiding problems with large car companies.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed cars for cheating devices that reduced emissions to comply with the provisions of the tests. In a normal run, the emissions were larger than the emissions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been charged with prosecutions in the United States, but the activities of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
In the last month, the former president of the Audi engine development division, who was responsible for thermodynamics, was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
In the past year, the Audi was involved in a criminal investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system that could circumvent European emission requirements, which was based on a similar investigation in the United States.
The audit may seriously undermine the position of Volkswagen: the share of the VV car manufacturer’s profits is disproportionately high.
The vote in Venezuela started with a confessional inquiry, a large demonstrations promised.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election results, President Tibisay Lucenan of the National Election Board said to journalists.
Maduro assures the end of the crisis.
In Venezuela on Sunday, the contested vote elected a delegation to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and held protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Maduro has delayed its demonstrations so that they would be in progress at the time of their appointment.
According to El Pais, the national security forces of the country started local time on Wednesday night to take over the country’s parliamentary building.
It is intended to ensure the security of the appointment event.
Climate change threatens Provence's laventia.
Laventel has become the symbol of the South French Provence region, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Laventel had declined due to drought and diseases, and researchers and farmers were trying to find a solution to the problem.
"Levents are actually under threat in the Provence region because they have been affected by the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a marked decline in the rain levels of spring and, in particular in the autumn," says Eric Chaisse, an expert on the CRIEPPAM research institute specialising in Provence, which specialises in agriculture.
"This will shorten the life span of the lavender.
In addition, drought has introduced a large number of small piles that spread microbacterials."
The stakes are hard.
Laventel oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desirable ingredient in perfume and cosmetics.
"We have smaller flowers now that are weakly developed or weakened or not completely missing", Chaisse says.
"In other words, essential oil-containing components are less and less."
The solution will be sought through more effective sourcing, slowing the soil moisture loss, and spraying plants by mixing clay and water, and developing the drought with better resistant varieties.
The murder of a journalist's murder is a growing threat in Mexico, Mexico and Mexico.
The delivery of the Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, will normally meet on Wednesdays to discuss how the newspaper will deal with the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug trafficking in the state of Sinaloa.
However, I am discussing security for the recent tragedy.
Journalists have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced suppliers are discussing which is safer to discuss which is safer: leave the children home or bring them into the supply to which a grenade attack was made in 2009.
Security experts have written three words to the front panel of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They're asking suppliers to name each group.
The record is written about the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists who are suspected to be in government or drug cartels who are criminals who make Mexico’s chaos a life-threatening news report.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Officials, at least 25 journalists have been murdered since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 journalists who were victims of attacks and threats have been attacked by the Federal Republic.
The latest victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodocen, supplier and source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist", Valdez wrote together about his many books on drug abuse.
He is deeply wanted, even though he is everywhere. Riodoce's building is surrounded by a huge picture of Valdez, where Valdez looks like a center ring. In the picture it says: "Just.." Thirteen journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez are dressed in T-shirts that clean up Valdez's smiling faces. Valdez has eyeglasses and become a brand of nuisance.
The meeting will be held less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia and fears of persecution.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up, in particular, for the purpose of dealing with suppliers' cases, but, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two charges have been brought up so far.
The killers of suppliers are only rarely brought to justice, as is the case with thousands of drug trafficking and the annual murders related to organised crime.
Riodoc's journalists are planning to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are broken down and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, there is little use for the Security Assembly because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is literally a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why the event happened."
Valdez had been removed from Riodoce's delivery in the state's capital city in Culiacan in the morning of May 15, 2018 at the latest.
He had driven only a few blocks from his red Toyota when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount is supposed to be linked to the name of the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away Valdez's car and rolled it around some distance.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was left to die by a wife and two adults.
The rumors move fast and return freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez's death is a mouse-jake.
It has been the bloodiest battlefields in Mexico since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. The competing groups want to fill the void.
Some or several people are killed daily on the streets of the village, and the cemetery has decorated double-layered tomb buildings that are larger than many homes.
In a State on the coast there is a "warm" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodocen, Ismail Bojorquez, 60 years old, feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published a interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a competing group that will engage in a war against the sons of Guzman.
The case may have upset Guzman's boys: customers suspected to be gang members bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the newspaper came to sales points.
The other mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after the attack was made on an attack by another newspaper published in the same case.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues could no longer fear for him.
He had made a long career in Nonoeste when he decided in 2003 to set up five colleagues with Riodocen. Lehde’s shares were sold at that time by $50.
"It was impossible to do journalism without dealing with a drug problem", Bojorquez says.
Over time, the newspaper began to feel bold and honest about its cases, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
The journalists appreciated the possibility of publishing hard-class research journalism without fear of censure, and readers were fascinating in the newspaper cases that no one else was afraid to publish.
After eight years of his creation, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cab Prize for its news in Latin America.
In the same year Valdez received the International Press Freedom Prize for Journal Protection for its courage to follow the story of Mexican drug trafficking without sensitising the story of Mexico.
He admitted openly he was afraid.
"I want to go on with my life," he said when he received the prize of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Drug trafficking is a "life-style" in Sinalo, Valdez said at the Rompeviito TV interview last October.
"The officer must take the task of putting him into action – or acting stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me where I was when death was sown here – why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoc's staff miss Valdez – a joker who cursed like a port worker. They miss a friend who always had mercy and advice. They miss a teacher who knew how to deal with it.
They trusted his routines.
He always used a flatter.
He went to the opposite El Guayabo bar and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they're asking if the routines were his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also made them wonder how they can best do their job and survive.
"The police don't like dealing with their women and their children and their clean business, their secret drug trafficking runways.
They were left out of conversation," says Bojorquez.
It meant, in the best case, strong self-responsibility and self-maintenance,
trust in your own instincts.
If it feels like everything's not right, then we should stay away.
The problem is that Riodoc's journalist Andres Villarreal says that "the impression can fail, and that happened in Javier's case."
The old rules no longer apply to Sinalo, nor do they apply in Tamaulpas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The operating environment is constantly changing.
Mobile phones were not allowed to enter the room where Riodoce's safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had appeared that only spy programmes sold to governments had been monitored by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for a tree cover from 40° W.
The State Government had ordered them to guard the premises of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle-class Culiacan region.
Part of the suppliers were numbered by half of the fact that these two police officers were part of the 50 % group that the governor of the state considered not reliable.
It's been months since the journalists had been in the mountainous countryside controlled by drug gangs.
This week's delivery of Riodoce had three major plans.
The size of the box was killed in Sinaloa, Julio Cesar Chavez's brother.
The paper was also about to reveal that the government's spending of money was concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the state's office, was kidnapped by a group of people.
There was no official information about it, who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to take it carefully: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in favour of both drug dealers and authorities.
The journalist found out from the public documents that the restaurant had been registered to a politician from the executive institutional revolution (PRI) who was a politician. PRI has ruled Mexico's policy at all levels for almost a century.
These governors have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high levels of publicity.
Villarreal asked the supplier to write about previous cases in the same place. In one of them, the son of El Chapo's Guzman managed to escape and avoid an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known to obtain reliable information about the kidnapping from Valdez column.
"We would have already known what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the nickname El Flaco because of his body structure.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's work room has been converted into a warehouse that keeps signs and labels against the persecution of journalists. Lehden's employees have received a new, unexpected task: they have become press-free activists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took with him a few signs when he left the next morning for a demonstration by the local Public Prosecutor's Office, which was responsible for another murder of the supplier.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez's murder in the West state of Micolacan.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, based on the DNA tests carried out by the authorities, Adame was found.
Journalists have begun to protest more loudly throughout the country. In demonstrations to the sidewalks and buildings there will be SOS Press texts.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain international support for an investigation into the Valdez case.
On the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
Since then, he has asked for the transfer of him out of government cases because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his anger.
Valdez had repeatedly stated that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, the authorities that allowed crime and the uninterrupted society.
In his last book on Narcojournalism Valdez writes that drug gangs are killing journalists, but they are also killed by the order of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to the Article 19, more than half of the attacks on suppliers last year were the result of police and authorities.
"Whether people are silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
The murders have a devastating effect on them.
No one forgets the death of a blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the north of Tamaulipas in the border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
At his body there was a note signed by Zetas cartel, saying, "I'm here because of my writings."
By his cut head, there was a computer keypad and headphones.
Some of the magazines have decided to end their activities, as the El Norte newspaper in the North of Chihuhua, after the murder of Miroslava Breach, the writer in the bordering state of Chihuahua, following the murder of Miroslava Breach.
Part of its activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, was continued, even though its leader was murdered in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published on his website a message: "What do you want from us?"
Participants have fled from their states or all over the country.
It's a difficult decision.
It's hard to find work on the ground, and you have to be alert all the time.
Sometimes criminals are looking for the supplier's hands, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a apartment in Mexico City in 2015 for three months after he fled from Veracruz.
For those who continue their work, every day is filled with dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — which once became a poet — admits that writing drugs scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is on her way to hell," he tells me.
Some time ago, Riodocen's reporters sat in front of the delivery by the sidewalk on Friday at midnight when the latest issue had been completed.
19 people were killed in the shooting between the competing gangs and the security forces in Mazatlan's landing destination.
The war accelerated, as promised in the messages from the cartel found in the area.
The journalists put the news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
I had to re-write the paper the next day.
Sirens are floating nearby – another shooting attack.
Bojorquez looked at the delivery of security officers:
if they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodoc's delivery continued the tradition of the murdered founder of the magazine under this massive figure, where a man shows a center ring for the entire Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider ending the operation. "How can I end the magazine when our intern asked us to get off the street to do the case on the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Manninen's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "A tough place"
The 39-year-old Hannu Manninen party was short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the exercise period began disastrously when Manninen got ill with the flu.
It started a long period of illness, which was nearly five weeks in length.
In practice, May went completely ill.
At first it was flu, and finally, a child’s disease like an ear infection that I had to eat antibiotics.
I could do only 10% of the planned exercises.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick for so long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't get used to practice, and Manninen's gonna tell Ilt-Sanom about it.
The results of the test shall be broken down.
The 2007 World Master received a training permit only on the second week of June, which was seen in the KIHU Unrolled Test of Singing and Top Sports on 12 June.
In the test, a sportsman sneaks on the rollers on a mat that is speeded up every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about 10 seconds, and the tester takes the athlete's finger from the tip of the needle to the lactic acid sample.
Last fall, I've been on the mat for 32 minutes, but now I've only stayed for 28 minutes.
Fire against the wall, Manninen tells me.
In the right direction the right direction the right direction.
After the beginnings, Manninen says she's been healthy.
I've done a variety of peaceful aerobic exercises that I've been trying to normalize the body’s metabolism.
It's a really good five-week period back now.
It was also a week and a half vacation from flight nights.
I'll be at the cabin with my family.
During the last period, Manninen participated in only four world cups of competition before the Lahti MM-Coffer.
The best result was immediately seen in the opening contest when Manninen got up at the top bridge in 18th.
Meant to be drawn.
Mr Petter Kukunen, head coach of the Mann and the national team, has prepared a training and competition plan for the next February to the end of the year.
Now we're going to apply for a different rhythm from the last season of practice.
After the first round of competitions, Ruka would have a three- World Cup weekend.
In December, the intention would be to be involved at least one weekend in the world Cup, perhaps in Ramsau.
At the end of January, the plans would still be part of Seefeld.
I hope after that we find a name on the Olympic Team's list, Manninen says.
The Olympic Olympics in Pyongchang would be Manninen's sixth winter Olympics already in career.
Now the most important thing is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City, 2002 the gold in the team race was the Nummelian subway.
Dinosaurus protected his enemy by masking the mask by masking his enemy.
At first it looks like a scary statue.
Now the researchers have revealed the first results of the research on the size of a horn hole found by a Canadian miner who had been so well preserved that the experts call it Mona Plusi of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers could even determine that its Finnish skin was red and had been "problemful past".
According to Current Biology, it has been the best preserved by the armored dinosaur and representatives of its best species in the world.
Recently found fossil is nodosaurus, which lived during the middle stages of the accession period between 110 and 12 million years ago.
Researchers consider this amazingly well-preserved fossils to be a truly significant discovery.
According to the National Geographic magazine, the herbeded herbivore is the best preserved fossil in her species for all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Albert, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found as a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to explore its discovery more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
For six years, the beast was dug out of a 1 100 kilo of dragons.
The results of hard work are now visible.
"If you stretch your eyes, you can almost believe it was in bed," says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the Royal Museum of Tyrrell.
"It remains in science's history of dinosaurs Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
In leather studies it was found that dinosaurs eating meat were likely a significant threat to this vegetarian, even though it had a tank and it resembled a walking tank wagon.
Its red-white tank masked it from predators and also protected it from darker and thiner coloring, which continues to occur in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to mix its environment and avoid greater dinosaurs, greater dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to the headlines in May, and it is now exhibited in the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrrell.
The researchers have given it the name Boarelopo to markmichelli Museum Techist Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7 000 hours to dig up the dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has survived so amazingly that Mitchell and the team of international scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body's veins and tanks.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general colour, where the body is darker and lighter.
The detection was still a surprise because Borealop is significantly bigger than the current animals with similar colour.
It may be concluded that dinosaurs eating meat caught it to such an extent that evolution prefers survival as a means of hiding instead of fighting.
From current animals, for example, peuros, zepros and armadillos, they have similar colours, which are significantly smaller and therefore easier prey, which suggests that nodosaurus was also seriously threatened by the threat of nodosaurus.
"The fate of a large, highly armored dinosaur tells us how dangerous the dinosaurs of the merger were", Brown says.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds of non-sustained intestines reveals that its skin was red.
Scientists will continue to study the nodosaur in order to draw conclusions on its life. They will examine, among other things, the content of its intestine to find out what it ate with its last meal.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drove to the sea where it sank onto the bottom of the sea.
Alberta was at that time as warm as it is now in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go much further than now.
"This nodosaurus is really significant because its Finnish skin is preserved and has also remained three-dimensionally in its original form" Brown states.
"That is why it looks almost the same as in the early period of accession period.
It does not require much imagination to visualize it: if you stretch a little of your eyes, you can almost believe it was asleep."
The date was the time of the tenropodes, the vast double-legged dinosaurs who had eaten meat.
Although their king, Tyrannasaurus rex, that is, millions of years earlier Borealopalta, its mighty predecessors may have captured this armored dinosaur.
The predecessors of the tyrantosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocantosaurus, a six-ton monster of about 11.5 metres long length.
The latest findings of Nodosaur’s researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, and they believe Borealop was swept out of the sea after his death and mummyed into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Albert, Canada on 21 March 2011, and was found as a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world's best preserved armored dinosaur with its skins and tanks from the fall to the hips.
Nodosaurs were on average five meters long and weigh up to 1,300 kg.
They've got two-millimeter peaks out of their decks.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetarian went through the present Western Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
Its tank has retained small details along its seabed grave.
Its fossilized residues have remained so well that its skin remains on the contents of the tank’s holed plate along its skull.
Indeed, Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic magazine that such preservation is "one rare as lottery profit".
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There's still fossilised leather on the tiny plate of that callopsar.
Its right edge is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate its foot-brains."
How did an activist learn to answer the question: who are the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked by 9.8.2014.
He had arrived a day earlier in New York from his home in St. Louis and sat on his airbnb flat on his bed to check Facebook on his phone.
Then he discovered a message from his high schoolmate:
"Your partner just killed an 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street."
She was confused to note that no one else had posted the same information about her feed, which is why she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were numerous retaliation requests in his time period from @TheePharoah.
The user name belongs to a rapist living in St. Louis who did a real-time twitch about Michael Brown's death. The White Police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a state of Missour.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's loss of body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he returned to Twitter later that night, people were told to gather in Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of the police's closures and screaming people as well as Brown's father of a man who claimed to be himself in the sign saying, "Ferguson's cop just killed my gunless son!"
Ferrell followed a real-time video where the police stood in front of the protestors with a barking dog.
He also tells me that he saw a video where another cop set his rifle and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers he said.
"It wasn't the kind of murder we've been used to, which could be called a typical.
That's when I felt cold colors.
I was angry and I cried."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11:00 a.m., and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old daughter's father and decided that they would leave for the next morning in the town of Ferguson.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years has been the documentary film "Wose Streets?". It was first-night movie theatre on 11 August 2017 at 11th.
The film is a story about survival and mentality, love and loss, as well as strength and persuasion from the point of view of the local people who went out to the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell headed for the Ferguson flower dress and with his daughter dressed as a suitable crown, they renegotiated the discussion of "the things to live in black and in what conditions." They had talked about it countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers his word to his daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's not right."
"I couldn't miss my daughter with me," Ferrell told me later.
"This day's events are... a peak of events in the past.
My daughter has the right to know and to grow up to it.
He must have the capacity to act and to organise himself, but he must also know the different layers and circumstances of the experience of black living. And he must know what we must do to get rid of ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect him from dirty racism, he is still the same as other black girls.
I feel like I'd harm him if I protected him from reality."
They had their first stop stop at Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located opposite the police station. It became the camp of activists when they were waiting for information about the case and eventually found out that the police would not be charged with the charges.
That's where Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunch in bags and distributed them to the protestors.
Ferrell began to take action in a new way.
"Aktivismini changed completely after August 9", he explains. During his studies at the University of Missour University of St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the organization of nursing students with minorities. At that time he focused on the rights of food and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience with the organization.
Something happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabaah Folayan, an assistant director of the document at the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "they simply wanted to tell you what was happening" what was happening.
She said, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use?"
As a result of the doubt, they were countless times when people had appeared in the local community, usually whites who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and its persuasion.
"We heard that those born and raised in Ferguson had no common voice", Folayan told us recently in the interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activities with the sentenced prisoners.
Davis’s involvement led Ferrelli to join the project with six other locals. The description group followed events in the years following Brown’s shooting.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak for us," says Davis.
"The most important thing to me was how local people are made in a movie because I'm presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experiences, because it seemed that the movement "not about the charismatic leader but about the community".
That is why the document is surprising about the private aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt pretty naked", Ferrell laughs when he told me how it felt to see the movie for the first time.
"But I realized that this work and the human image of blacks require certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrel's story times and reintroduces the role of middle black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
The movement was created in social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot a black teenage boy named Trayvon Martin in 2012.
"The leadership of black women has kept the whole movement up", Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight constantly on many fronts.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement really maintains black women, including a lot of queer women."
However, he stressed that Ferrelli was not chosen because of his "exclusively" queer identity.
"He's got energy", Folayan says.
"But it is no coincidence that she was in the front line. Black queer women live in a lot of things at the cutting point, and they have a lot to play.
He's got his energy coming from a underwear."
The new target groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the gap between the Community and the police is still tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole, and he was sentenced to block the highways for the demonstration.
His description of the social climate in his home circles is short and fundamental: "A mixed fight."
Still, he continues to rely on the attack clause which he learned from the outside on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"Our chance is to fight for our freedom.
Our duty is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can only lose our chain."
A suitable probability: the artist creates shapes of Chelsea Manning's DNA from Chelsea Manning's DNA.
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the exhibition area with a face – white, black and brown faces, where you can see the appearance of a similarity, looking at more closely.
These 30 works are the shapes of Heather Dewey-Hagborg, based on DNA samples taken from Chelsea Mann's cheek and hair.
Manning sent samples of Fort Leaveworth prison in which he performed his 35 years of his sentence. Manning was sentenced to leaking classified diplomats to WikiLeaks website.
The Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
In this context, there are two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transit and career-oriented reverser whose prison sentence Barack Obama reduced his term of office on the third day of the last day.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA by algorithmising and created 30 images based on his genetic data. They are sharp, although a little theoretical position on the adaptability, multi-translucency and underlying causal relationships and identity of DNA data.
Chelsea Manning, known as Bradley Edward, has openly reported that he had been the same as women since the breakup, and he was found guilty of 20 crimes in 2013, including breaches of the law of spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of Manning, sentenced to prison: a brutal, black and white selfie, where Manning sits in the driver's seat in the car.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg had been behind him in 2015 with a great favor for the Stranger Visions project which he carried out in 2012.
There he created shapes based on criminal technical data, and he received DNA data from, for example, tobacco chips and gums, and created images of what the people in question might have looked like.
Then the artist received e-mail from Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case", Dewey-Hagborg told me about the new exhibition at the press conference.
Manning was unable to visit and could not be filmed in prison. So the newspaper contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his imprisoned mule suddenly became friends of correspondence, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even worked together on the Suppressed Images series, which was illustrated by Shoili Kanungo. It described a future where the president would have reduced Chelsea's judgment and he could see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama shortened Manning's judgment only a few days after the publication of the comic book, and it was a lucky coincidence after seven times in a US military prison.
It is also impressive that the exhibition will be opened right now that Donald Trump is engaged in his own war against data leaks and trans-society soldiers, and will come up with new ways to strengthen the powerful doubts he was actually supposed to alleviate.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all things have a purpose".
There is an artist's statement on the wall of the gallery, and under it the great signature of Manning, where the heart is at the point of last name i. In its opinion, the artist calls for an end to "automatic division based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite wall is Manning's DNA sequence: a long line of C, G and A letters written with lead pen.
In this case, 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist, include – a combination of Dewey-Hagborg wants to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"My exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our gene family and that genetic information is very personal and open to interpretations", Dewey-Hagborg says. The exhibition also shows his Spurious Memory video from 2007.
"DNA tells countless stories, and here's 30 of them."
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: page from the cartoon of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There's Manning's character rising from prison like King Kong, with megaphone in his hand.
"If they get you down, they've won," the picture says.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is from the letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Unlike the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. When Manning shows up, he was greeted by his face based on his own genetic data as a group of protesters in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, as is everything else in this exhibition: for example, Manning's DNA sequence is written with lead on the height that is the same as his length (157.5 cm).
"The people were on the wall before, but I wanted to bring them into the sense of the crowd," says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe Chelsea's mass movement, which was also behind his release."
The professor at Northchester University University and the employee of Oxford University University of Oxford are wanted as a suspect in a murder investigation.
The police will report that they have launched a national search to find the professor of Northchester University and a staff member of Oxford University who is suspected to be stabbed to death in a Chicago luxury residence.
The case file in Cook County shows that on Monday arrest warrants were issued from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Dranleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after he had been stabbed several times.
According to the local local information published by the Chicago Police Police Department, the body was found on 27 July 2007.7.7.7.7.
The police alarmed at the Grand Plaza building found a victim with several cut wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleau was found dead at the scene of the event and the stab was investigated as a murder, and the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the Nortwester University since 2007 onwards.
Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage, responsible for the University's social relations, stated by e-mail in his opinion that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been prohibited from access to the campuses of the Northchester University.
"This is a criminal case that the authorities are investigating, and the Northwestern University helps with the investigation", Cubbage wrote.
Warren works as a parent in financial care at Oxford University.
The opinion sent by the University and by email from Somerville College states that "we have been in contact with the police in the UK and we are ready to assist the US investigation authority in all possible ways."
In addition, the opinion stated that Warren's colleagues are upset and hope that he will surrender.
The Chicago Police Officer Anthony Guglimeli said that he urged the suspects to seriously surrender to the authorities.
"The police have an understanding of where they are, and we keep looking for them," said Guglimel.
According to Guglidel, local, regional and national authorities help find suspects.
He told me that the police had received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had received an vague indication that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as horrific at the scene.
According to Guglidel, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me security cameras revealed that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," says Guglimelmis.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board published to the residents the following release: "The police are currently examining the course of events and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the possibility of domestic violence."
He threatened to blow up Islamic book shop and kill Muslim Muslims in London, London.
"I'm not an anti-mumoli, I'm a Catholic," the convicted said to the police.
The Moffatt will have to perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to blow up the Islamic bookstore in London and kill all Muslims.
According to the Indepent magazine, David Moffatt was sentenced, among other things, to gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff called them in on May 23th.
According to the staff, the man was "a man who threatened to blow up a bookstore and kill Muslims."
The suspect left the store after the threats.
Moffatt was caught calling the police about the threat.
The threat did not relate to events in the bookstore.
The authorities found that Moffatt had been dressed in the same direction as the suspect in the bookstore events, the police officer said.
I'm not an anti-mumoli, I'm a Catholic, Moffatt said to the police during the interviews.
As punishment, a man will have to perform a hundred hours of unpaid social service and pay 620 pounds, i.e. about €690 legal expenses and 85 pounds, or about €95 compensation for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's informant, several hate crimes are left unreported.
"We will complete WADA's road map operations in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mukot, Russian Deputy Prime Minister.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mukko has said that Russia will soon complete the WADA road map operations in accordance with the WADA Road Map to restore the RUSADA competences of the Russian Anti-Dating Commission.
"Part of the road map measures have already been taken, and RUSADA received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD.
WADA's road map has been updated on these points", Mukko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for restoring RUSADA’s powers. The second part of the road map was published on the organization’s website.
According to the pattern, it does not involve any concern for Russia.
"It is all declared, and everything is implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympics Committee and WADA in the near future", Mukko added.
However, one of the aspects of the road map requires the Russian anti-doping authorities to publicly accept the results of the investigation of the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren. McLaren examines the alleged proportion of the State in Russian sports doping.
By the way, he said: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-doping system has committed a failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no national programmes, and we cannot admit things that did not exist."
Mr Mutkon said that there were echoes of the opinion of Mr Vitally Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov, who spoke to the Russian RSport sport on the same day, admitted that there have been problems in the Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are conflicting statements and regulations in the report.
We are not going to accept the report unconditionally", but he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping surveillance in Russia in November 2015, when the size of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, in June last year it received permission to plan and coordinate testing under international experts and UKAD surveillance.
After a visit, Olivier Niggli, Director of WAA, visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After visiting, he concluded that the organisation was "the right way" towards the return of powers.
British organization in sceptical for Finnish people about loving innovation: "There is no evidence of health benefits for maternity packages".
The British organization has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Amongst other things, BBC and Guardian are saying that the Lellaby Trust, who fights hide-and-seekers, prohibits the use of their own brochures in UK- shared maternity packages.
The distribution of medical packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, packaging is also distributed in some regions.
According to Lillaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity pack would reduce the risk of hidden death.
The death of a mother means an unexplicable sudden death of a baby.
Lillaby Trust acts as an expert on the UK health authorities in the corner of a safe sleep for the child.
We will no longer allow us to pack our official brochures on them, because it would allow us to understand that we recommend this product, the organization's information.
In Finland, there is one of the lowest rates of child mortality rates in the world, only two dead per thousand born.
According to Lullaby Trust, the good reading of Finland is the result of many different reasons, such as the small number of teen races.
The fact that they give each family a box could be one factor.
However, you can't say for sure, Francine Bates, CEO of Lulaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hide-and-seed deaths.
The maternity package is a Finnish invention, and it has been granted free of charge to all mothers for 80 years in Finland.
Packs of different articles, such as children's clothes.
This year, there are 53 products in this package.
Self-packaged is a cardboard box where the child can be put to sleep.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all safety standards.
Lillaby Trust, for its part, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes as a place to sleep.
According to Lullaby Trust, the packaging may be the best place to sleep if there is no frame or coating available.
It recommends that the package be used only for the daytime of daytime and that it ceases to be used at the time the child can turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pet animals away from the packaging and to ensure that it is not soaked or dirty.
The mean frog escaped again from the Japanese zoo in Japan.
The Japanese zoo staff is looking for an escaped turtle.
The giant turtle has surprised the staff at their speed and has run away for the second two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa zoo in West Japan on Tuesday morning in Okaya.
The security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It won't die right away because it eats grass around the zoo, but we're very worried about Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo.
A 35-year-old frog is a female, 55-kg, and is approximately one-millimeter long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
During the summer season, the frog can travel freely to the tardock area.
The zoo has not received any evidence of ocular evidence of turtles.
The last runaway happened a week ago.
Yamane found a fugitive walking down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I saw it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help you to avoid Uber's mistakes.
Amy Sott wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in his online trade startup, but the questionnaires didn't work.
The responses were often vague, inefficiencies or even misleading.
Although he assured that the questionnaires were anonymous, some of the employees were suspicious about them.
"The reasons were simply not consistent and objective", Erett explains. As his hair care company Madison Reed focuses on online commerce. The company has 75 employees.
Then decided to resort to external assistance.
The market has become increasingly new types of human resources management start-ups that help other companies to find out how their employees can.
They develop and license software that can measure the engagement of employees. Companies can conduct surveys and focus them on certain teams and population groups, as well as provide their employees with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, direct contact with the governing board.
"Your health can be monitored by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company Fitbit?" asks the founder and CEO of Glint-Startup in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint provides companies with analytical software to measure employee engagement.
He's been using Glint's software for three years, and he's told me that he's had a deeper view of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
In addition, you can draw up a map of which you can see with one eye what sections workers are more dissatisfied with who the leaders have had the worst assessments.
The companies have understood that they must monitor the culture of employment so that they do not become the next Uber. Around the transport company, they have been exhausted since the former employee wrote in his blog about the culture in which workers are being punished and the problems they are facing.
For applications like Glint, such failure is an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global sector whose value can rise to over USD 118.7 billion by 2020 according to the Let's Talk Payments website.
The Convertcent in the state of Colorado is a startup that helps companies to detect and prevent inappropriate behaviour. Interest on the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
The Converten has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla, for example.
It recently concluded an agreement with Uber too.
Like Glint, Convertcent allows companies to make customized questionnaires, collect the answers in a confidential way in real time and identify problem areas.
In addition, workers can report anonymous behaviour by means of an anonymous SMS.
And if there is reason to suspect the Director, the complaints will go directly to the board of directors of the company.
"The opinion has been rejected by the authorities," says Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convertcent.
He recalls that if a company treats its employees badly or does not work in an undesirable way, the consequences may be costly even if the authorities do not intervene. Consumers can start botising the company and it can also lose employees and be tried.
The Ruby Tuesday food chain has more than 25 000 employees at 500 locations. The company has spent over a year trying to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have easy access to the main office.
In the past, the practice was that if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first find out a telephone number or an e-mail address that enabled him to make a notification to the head office. Then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience", says Ruby Tuesday's lawyer James Vitrano, who said that the complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, the problems remained hidden from the leaders working in another city or state, and now the problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I have a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the reality of the employee," says Vitrano, who is leading Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related proceedings."
According to Quinlan, companies began to take ethical, values and employee commitment more seriously after the collapse of the audit firm Arthur Andersen in the context of Enron scandal.
Only by social media did the companies realise that they could no longer prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly cleared.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology came into ethics control", Quinlan says.
Glint and Convertcent provide their software as a service that is regularly charged with their use.
It is a business model accepted by venture capital investors and an opportunity, both for Glint and Convertcent to support equity investors.
In February, the Convercent collected $10 million of funding from companies such as Sawshire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised capital to a total of $47 million.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Culture Partners and has raised a total of $60 million in funding.
Investments are not surprising given the links between companies, corporate culture and venture capital.
According to several studies, employees expect more jobs than before.
Good wages in markets such as silicone competitions, and interesting projects are only the beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to a genuinely beneficial company.
"The workers are more committed to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are being listened and that their work is rewarding," says Nina McQueen, Director of LinkedIn, responsible for the remuneration and well-being of employees.
Investors will receive returns when companies succeed, and companies will succeed when employees commit themselves.
Third-party analytical tools promise to strengthen employee engagement, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to workplace culture experts, information on employee engagement is important,
but it is useless if it does not lead to any action.
If a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be considered as a sign of a change.
And if the change does not come quickly enough or nothing changes, disappointment may reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to have four thousand discussions", says Russell Raath, Director General of Kotter International, the management consultant.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start wondering if they'd been heard.
and whether their opinion matters at all.
If the company does not care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to this story, Madison Reed is currently doing staff checks every month and is able to deal with the problem on the same day that it is reported in Glint.
The municipalities had collected feedback from workers who were frustrated with the quality of decision-making and communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the long-term sustainability of staff in the sector, which is known for the great change in employees.
"If an undertaking does not commit to creating a culture of transparency, it loses employees", Vitrano says.
"If it loses employees, it also loses customers.
And without customers there are no companies."
In Sweden, a 20-year-old man is suspected of dazzling his naked female neighbor, reports the news office TT.
The woman living in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had noticed her phone hanging at the end of the bitch outside her window.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera was shot in the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the case had been running into another room to dress up.
After she had arrived to check the situation, her cell phone had been pulled up first, but soon after that, it was counted in the window again.
A 20-year-old suspect has admitted that he described a woman.
However, he claimed that only a woman's face was filmed.
The video on the walk had been removed, and the police had failed to return it as evidence.
In the interviews, a man has admitted his actions, but he refused to commit a criminal offence.
The man who was describing himself was right to say that he loved his neighbor as "dude crazy".
According to the U.T.R., he's being charged with a man in the case.
Teachers are calling for more liquidity in the autumn negotiations.
The wage development cannot be lower than, for example, the export industry, but the difference should be reduced, said OAJ President Olli Lukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary cut in the public holidays emphasizes the difference, he points out.
We do not have the possibility to conclude agreements that would in any way have been accompanied by temporary allowance cuts.
In the municipal sector, contracts will only be concluded once the private sector's papers have been signed and the interest rates will be understood.
It is rich to predict that, for example, the terms of employment of the OAJ have been agreed in January.
Per cent targets The Lukkainen hasn't revealed yet.
It is also the President of the Council of the Public Training Organisation.
Remarkable: Holiday surgery increases earnings development differences in earnings development differences.
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that the purchasing power of public sector employees is diminishing, while private sector purchasing power is increasing at the same time as private sector purchasing power is increasing.
According to a large number, fixed-term leave surgery will further reduce the differences in earnings development.
In Finland, it should be defined how many pupils per teacher can be per teacher.
OAJ also points out that equality between basic education needs to be ensured, as the differences between the best and the weak are growing at all times.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are reduced, and the differences between pupils and regions are growing continuously.
The day of the Bruins players’ day went up when the NCAA reduced daily exercises between two and two together.
It's almost 11:00 a.m., a group of UCLA American football players have been left to discuss the new campus training fields across the board.
Some of them have taken off their shirts, and their backs will be out of their hair after the first day of the training camp's scratching.
Time for many of them this few minutes of chat is a midday break.
After three hours of training, students who study summer courses at the University will return to the apartment to read the final exams. The next morning they will meet from 7:30 to the Wasserman Football Center.
"Keeping up for three days will be tough for these guys", coach Jim Mora of Bruins says a little before the turn of Monday to Tuesday.
The aim of the change was to reduce the number of players' work, but it has extended their days – at least until Friday, when the final tests are carried out.
That is why the first three UCLA exercises started over seven nights. It was difficult for players to find space on the full schedule anyway.
Limitation of training courses in one day means that the training days have been more than ever. The camp started this year almost a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Moran six continuing during the Westwood training period, while the exercises are held at the same time with summer courses.
Practices are planned to be held 18 times before the 20th day of August, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the season: UCLA meets the Texas A&M university in September.
Mora says that it supported the amendment of the NRA, even though it made players' schedules even more stringent.
"We're gonna spend a great deal of time on them for three or four days, and that's very challenging," Mora says.
"But the players are ready to work, and they're great friends.
I think it'll make it easier for us to get to Saturday, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes the exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy to take into account the direct view of the parking area next to the training fields and the Lusk Center, a high-level hotel that has already been bombed over the protective net behind the goal pole by flying football.
Bruins players are supposed to move to a hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the season when rooms are available outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The danger is that people can book the room and shoot exercises from there to the video.
The video described by the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards over there and in the parking lot.
We do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom to Rwanda shall be waived.
In the Middle African Rwanda, presidential elections will be held on Friday, the winners of which are already considered clear.
Paul Kamame is officially seeking for the third term, but in practice he has had an impact on the country's leadership since 1994.
At that time, the rebel group RPF stopped the genocide of the extremes.
Kamame was commander of RPF.
Kamamea has been criticised, inter alia, for breaking the opposition and limiting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused, for example, of the distortion of poverty statistics.
For the third period, Kamame will be able to pursue it because the Constitution, which was changed to two seasons of the presidency, was established.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also a genuine leader.
In the meantime, social reforms have been carried out in Rwanda and international investment has flowed into the country.
In addition, Kamame has played a major role in combining a country that is divided by genocide.
The success of Rwanda has led many Africans to ask whether a liberal multilateral democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, the Kamame has promised its people more freedom after the land has been lifted up on its feet.
Could be a good time to start.
Facebook is fighting against the fake news by stepping up the examination of facts.
Facebook intends to send possible false news to more and more independent factor inspectors and to present the results below the original article. The world’s largest social network will report this on Thursday.
The company published on its website a statement that it will start using updated machine learning in the identification of fake news. Possible fake news will be sent to the auditors of facts and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the largest Associations of Litts. Many people feel that false news was the result of the U.S. presidential election in 2016.
The topic has risen to a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombed with false ideas before the May presidential elections and the September elections, Germany will support the plan for the setting-up of social media networks if they do not remove hostile content rapidly.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the examination of facts is being conducted in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"The people want to see what stories do not pass through the side of independent inspectors. They also want more background information to be able to decide more closely what to read and share", product manager Sara Su wrote in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue testing the related articles - and will make other changes to its content in order to reduce false news.
Release of a series book: The story of a castle.
Today, the music video of Squeeze and Margaret Thatcher are known as the hiding place of Margaret Thatcher from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has been behind it for 700 years a stormy history, and now this charming place in the Bewlin River Valley is the theme of a comic book, written by Jamie Rhodes, a moped-haired writer who used old documents.
"I think it's great to be able to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says visibly.
"I feel a personal contact when I hold a letter in my hand."
Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells about family stories from the Middle Ages of the family who lived in Scotland to the time of Eden. Each story has been imagined by a different artist, a promising British cartoon designer: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teath and Other Stores were published by Dead Men's Teath and Other Stores whose inspiration the sources were documents of the British National Library.
"I moved into tears in my letter a thumbprint. The letter had written a double agent working for the Jacobits in the 17th century," says Rhodes.
"It was his fingerprints.
The letters smell like smoke because at that time the lighting was used as a fire.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel like he's on the ground himself.
I love archives!"
An old author who lived in a castle for almost four months with the support of National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council in England, which felt too good to be true. He admits that he could not be in jail without delay longer than it would have been hoped for.
He spent days studying the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures, and rares, such as the hyena heads hung on the walls and the bottles held in the valet for centuries.
He toured the ruins and spaces of the old castle and discussed the forest guards, gardeners and sometimes also the books of the artists who were picturesque.
At night, he "towed whiskey and started writing.
The nearer history of Scotland is quite unknown, as the town moved to the National Trust Foundation only after the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was just about to begin the archive review process. Rhodes describes that archives had been kept for hundreds of years by the same method: by taking everything to an extraordinary attic.
The journals had journals, letters from the time of the English Empire and maps of who owned anything. "You could imagine that the earthquakes are boring," Rhodes says. "But this is where the families are fighting even one hardship.
I thought maybe we should just let it be."
Some of the stories of the book go from castle to history in England, as The Labourer. It tells about a man who will soon be joining the castle after the completion of the castle in 1381.
"The book of Kent and Sussex mentions that there was a riot in the castle in 1380", says Rhodes.
"The British Hosting Capt. began in the same area, and it occurred to me that rebellion may begin with riots.
Perhaps these events are related?"
The other stories of the book are closely linked to the history of the castle — like The Priest, the story of the priest that Darrell’s family hid seven years during the time of the religious cleansing in England.
The Smugggler, again, tells of the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell in the 17th century. He is said to have framed his own funeral by filling his coffin with stone (it was observed years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family in Scotland. "The family men seem to have been a lot of weirdies, and they were constantly in debt and bought things they couldn't afford.
The men of Darrell's family would solve their debt problems by getting married to wealthy old women, and I see them as handsome friends who knew how to relieve heirs."
Now Rhodes is applying for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the cure from Life Mountain, which was active in the early 20th century, with only a flattered plot left.
There's a special place in Barney's castle in her heart.
"It was sad to leave from there," he says.
"I wish I hadn't wanted to go back to this damn everyday life yet."
In Russia, the worst of the Cold War will then be the worst war of the Cold War.
The military union between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, commenting by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think I can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we were hoping that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
But especially since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and in view of the continued instability in Russia's eastern Ukraine, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, however, NATO is still committed to acting so that the tensions do not tighten to its peak.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can have a political dialogue with Russia in order to avoid an increase in the situation and a new cold war.
Before Stiltenberg's comments on the U.S. President Donald Trump made it possible for the United States and Russia to reach an even dangerously poor level.
Trump urged the country's poor-interested Congress, which last week adopted new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klitshko will stop - the replay against Anthony Joshua is not going to happen against Anthony Joshua.
The long-term career of professional promotional careers is ended by world champion Vladimir Klitshko, who is a world leader.
Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Klitshko, who struck gold, became a professional 69 times, winning matches in 64.
He held different MM bonds between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his career in two final games.
Tyson Fury hit him at a point in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klitshko met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium, and lost his way after a wild fight in the 11th round.
Joshua and Klitshkon were expected to face a replay in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klishko did not find motivation for the match.
I deliberately took a few weeks to make a decision to get enough distance to the Wembleyn match, Klitshko told me in his release.
As an amateur and professional fighter, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sports.
I could never have imagined I had such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See the explanatory statement by Klishkon to its decision on the video.
The Klitshkon manager Bernd Bönte reported that the termination decision was difficult for Klichko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he no longer has enough motivation.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Bönte said.
Klitshko has been dating Hayden Panettier, an American actor since 2009.
The church has one child, born 2014 as a daughter of Kaya.
Klithkon's great brother Vitali is also the former world's heavyweight champion.
In 2008-12, brothers ruled the World Trade Organisations' World Trade Agreements at the same time.
The weatherer in Finland picks up the circumstances: "Fire a file".
Minna Nikinen has suffered the conditions during the summer's outdoor season.
Minna Niksis has had problems with circumstances.
The wind and the cold have taken a woman from her boyfriend.
There are also unstable conditions in the London World Cup.
Minna Niknen is talking about weather.
The conditions have been this summer's lube jumper against Minna Nikka.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I didn't even get the little drapes to move properly, and Nikinen said after the Insbruck race.
I've been racing and practicing here the way how many times I've never been in this place with the same variety of winds, Nikinen told Paavo Nurm in Games.
During this period, the constantisation of the jump has been very difficult when exercises have had such unstable winds, Nikinen said in Kaleva's races.
The weather was in London on Thursday too.
The time for the challenge has been to get the technique into a pile of-- is it cold cheese or something?
It's been cold and windy, and it's taken away from the file.
It doesn't make sense to consume energy under a bad condition.
He made his grey jump 455 thanks to the World Cup.
There's been 445 out there.
The relationship in London is not the same for everyone.
We have to be cool and wait for a better wind.
The aim is to cross 460 on Friday's watch.
Why don't you change to practice abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning.
I got a jump in the bag and the technique fixed.
I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, the government has been able to practice, and now the hall has been closed.
What's it like to fight like?
It's 25 degrees warm.
Even if it's standard, a small wind will happen.
Experienced ex-employed politicians Yle said, "We have no division now and not many years now".
Despite a positive economic climate, the Government of Juha Sipilä has to keep the government budget expanding by debt, to warn the Ministry of Finance about the budget being prepared for decades by Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared the budget for Erkki Virtanen.
According to him, there is no division.
Yle interviewed Virta, a retired in 2015 in the Middle Week’s United Kingdom.
The construction of the State budget for the next year is about to begin.
Recently, the proposals put forward by the politicians include raising a guarantee pension, calculating car tax and supporting electricity wheels, Virtanen considers it to be constituencies.
The main point is that elections are beginning to be close, because when 10% of the government budget is financed by additional debt, we have no room for distribution now and for many years.
I even think it's cheating to talk about the distribution of debt, Virtanen told Yle about it.
Virtanen stressed that all debts are owed to children.
The Authority has a long-standing experience in the preparation of state budgets: in 1978, he started the Ministry of Finance as Secretary-General and subsequently worked as Deputy Director of the Budget Directorate and Head of the Budget Directorate.
Last time he retired, he was the head of staff of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in Ylen's interview that the projected three-percent economic growth rate of three per cent is likely to be temporary.
All the predictors estimate that this is a piece that will be starting next year to go to the bottom line, and Finland will be waiting for one percent increase in Finland for ten years.
Washington is changing the rules of law governing a permanent residence permit.
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that, according to the media, the rules on permanent residence, namely the Green Card, will be amended by a new immigration plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, to tighten the requirements of temporary working permits and to limit family visas.
New rules have been proposed by the Republican and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to citizens of other countries.
It also reduces circular migration and replaces the current programme.
Applicants who benefit from the new search process, who are able to support themselves and have the potential to benefit from our economy," Trump said according to the media.
The spouse of the Danish queen queen of Denmark does not want to be buried with the queen queen in the same place with the queen of Denmark's queen in the same place.
Prince Henry doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareeta.
In the picture, Prince Henry and Queen Margaret, described in April.
The Danish queen Margareeta, 77, and his spouse, Prince Henryk, 83, is not buried next to him, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, ruling couples in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's Room has today announced that Prince Henry does not want to be buried in Rosskilde's court, the court declares in his announcement on Thursday's announcement.
According to BT, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction with his role in the royal family.
There is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and titles in the Danish monument, the court communications manager, Lene Belleby, commented in the newspaper.
The decision of the prince not to bury him alongside the queen is a natural consequence that he is not treated equally with his wife.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the wish of her spouse’s funeral place and understands the decision.
A horror on the road: the car was to get on the highway on top of the highway.
Tom had a half-life and two small children.
They were not injured by an accident, but they will not receive the money from the insurance if the other party is not targeted.
The accident happened at the Keimolanport in Vantaa.
The archived building site of Kähä III's construction works.
Vantalainen Tommi tells us that his family survived on Tuesday a miracle trade in a car accident.
Tom, his cocoon Riina and the couple had two little children driving on the freeway at the Keimolanport in the direction of Vantaa in the direction of Hämeenlinna.
From the entrance to the Hämeenlinlinna bus to the Hämeenlinna route, a white car that was to drive the family's car to the side, says Tommi.
Without the van, the car would have gone on to Tom.
I brakeed and turned the car at the same time, and it left the hand, Tommi tells me.
The family's car was hit by a high-speed radio.
Parents and two young children who were in the back seat were not injured.
One child is slightly less than 3 years old, the other under the age of one year.
It must have been a pretty good thing when nothing happened to us.
Not even us were the ones who passed by, even though there was a lively traffic in the place.
The accident took place at about 17.20 a.m.
Tom says no one stopped at them, and the family called 911.
They got out of the car by themselves.
The ambulance and rescue staff were present, and the family's condition was checked.
The car went back to redemption.
Tommi tells her and her husband that they have little income, and they got a little bit of aid to buy a car a couple years ago.
Without the information of another car, the family in Tommi says that the insurance will not receive the money from the insurance company.
That's why the family hopes that witnesses will notice about the car that led the family to the echo.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take children to the yard and go to work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was white, old car.
It was probably the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
According to him, the car's license number started with SIG.
If we don't get caught, I don't know how we're doing financially, we still have to count every cent today.
Tommia hopes that it has happened or that some people know about it are connected to the police.
The Eastern U.S. Police Department and Central U.S. rescue services confirm that they have had a mission on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case have been corrected at 21.15: Unlike the original case, another car did not come by to the front of the family car, but was driving from the hut to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppinen's performance deals with relationships with humor by means of humor - Self-reviewer will be seen at What? Theatre on Friday and Saturday on Saturday.
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings her first-born guide to what? theater.
The self-deliver is a music theater performance about past relationships and insufficient relationships.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says it's still a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by humor.
I don't think I'm gonna make you feel bad, and I'm not gonna make you feel bad, he says.
A circular summer theater performance has been carried out according to Jäppäis with a horizontal budget and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance asks you to consider what a person reveals himself when you get to know a new person.
Do you think he'll pull a role or approach the other jacket open?
A drink presentation blends with fact and fiction.
The rigid has both guided and dramaticized the performance.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The presentation consists of the texts of the working group, and it does not have a plan.
The director believes that even though the presentation makes young people's thoughts exhaustive, it speaks to people of all ages.
It should be pointed out that the self-reporting agent does not directly tell about his own or the human relations of the working group.
The fact and fiction are mixed up.
I'm sure my world of values will come out of the show.
I don't think that relationships are bad, but I don't think that a relationship, especially a relationship, would be a condition of happiness.
A lot of people learn from different parents from their parents.
Jähäninen believes that the self-reviewer will draw up a timely picture of young adults living in Finland living in one hundred years of age.
According to him, many have learned a lot from their relationship parents, many of whom have been divorced.
At least you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay with a bad relationship.
The presentation is played by Mine Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes Ella Snellman, the supporter.
The adjustment of the music is for Jähpinen and Roka.
Love in the theater was lit in Kovuvola.
Lotta Jäppinen, 26 from Kouvola, studies as director of the theatre expression at the University of Applied Sciences of Turku.
It's two years behind, and there's another one in front of you.
A mere enthusiasm for the theatre has begun during the Kouvola years.
The teacher of the music classes has been an assistant in the Kouvola Theatre and played, among other things, at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and the last time in the City Theatre in Turku.
Control has become more and more interesting.
The self-deliver got his first night at the Narr stage last week in Helsinki.
In the future, a presentation lasting about 45 minutes has also been seen at least in Jäppinen University of Turku in the future.
Self-resursurrenderer Kouvola What? in the theater 4.8. 19 and 5.8. at 14 and 19.
For a year, the Finnish Olympic winner recovered from a terrible motocrossn non-motocrossion - the neck was broken.
Rare athletes in Finland have the same unprepared natural power as Janne Lahtela.
At the end of the year, hundreds of days went around the world for twenty years and pursued their dream of the Olympic Games.
The dream came true in 2002, but the movement of Lahtela continued.
He was not only a tired trainee, but also a pilot of new species.
There are probably not many types of exercise on earth that the chemical lake would not have tried at least once.
It's inspired to practice.
There's always something new about it, so Latella tells me.
Eventually, one hobby was to stop Latella completely.
In 2014, the solution was hit by a  motocross accident.
As a result, his neck and both hands were broken.
I didn't work anywhere.
I've been eating wounds at my house for a year, says Lahtela.
That's bad luck on the counter.
He also admits that age could have had some part of its share in the damage.
You know, driving a girl can sound pretty crazy.
But I didn't get that line.
It's just as a species so hard that it's not too much for this 40-year-old to do.
After the accident, Latella was facing a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
There was a long rush in the back of Japan's freestyle team as head coach of the team's freestyle team.
The solution started in the nest immediately after the end of its career in 2006 in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there.
I didn't really do much of anything, Látela tells me.
Even during the training period, Lahtel was often challenged by its shields in the slope and physics tests.
Surprisingly, stopping was a good experience.
I was so tired physically and mentally that my own thoughts didn't seem reasonable either.
Not even the species.
It's good to be here.
I'm really enjoying it because for the first time, I was just able to be.
A mandatory break was inspired by Lahtela to be the head coach of Finland.
Without stopping, he's afraid he'd be burned to the end.
It's easier to find places that've gone apart than empty ones.
I would never have realized that I needed so much rest.
The solution started as coach of the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safer hobby in place for the drivers.
I've changed the motocrosses to frisbeegolph.
I mean, it's just out of the flat right now.
At least I was seven hours a day throwing at you.
Even though she has always been a superintendent, she does not require her coaching to be the same as she is.
I won't force everyone into the same fashion.
In our culture, there is room to be our own people and ways of becoming the world's best.
The style is free style, and mentality has always been consistent with it, Lahela says.
The sex robots come and we have to worry worry about us.
It is here: a report on technological developments in the sex robotics sector – just as it was beginning to feel like 2017 could no longer get any weirder.
Yeah.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5 to 10 years.
"We must start to take serious account of the spread of sex robots", says the founding member of the Foundation and the Emeritus Professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Noel Sharpy Sheffield University.
Customers can choose the colour of the robot's eyes, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingertips.
"The sex robots are slowed down, but they're already sold quite a lot, and we're gonna see them more and more."
The sexes have developed into breathtaking doll robots with warm-like silicon skin and artificial intelligence-created features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from the color of the eyes to the shape and colour of the nipples and fingertips.
It is even more worrying that robots have "personality" that makes Stepford women look like advanced freedom fighters.
The sexes have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of RealBotix-robot may be adapted to the user's preferences, such as shyness.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of True Companion have pre-programmed personality: Frigid Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is adventure-like and so on.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality adapts as fully as possible to the user's personality", the company's website is advertised.
In other words, robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different views:
it may be even tired, talking or "in the mood".
There are many worrying features in the generalisation of sex robots, which replace genuine human relationships, but it is even more dangerous to defeat women and direct rape situations when the user approaches, for example, a shy and counter-programd robot, for example.
True Companion compares the Roxxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
"Women have a vibrator. "Why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fecis or a new kind of sex game.
Their generalisation and development is about something darker and deeper in our culture: from a decline in gender equality towards sexual interaction, where subduing is one of the options among others.
Of course, most men do not get sex robots, and their popularity remains a margin, even though the FRR report indicated their growing popularity.
However, marginal phenomena tell a lot about the life of time.
And many start acting strangely or offensively only when the market permits it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become widespread at the same time as women's rights are threatened throughout the world and in the White House there is a president sitting in a White House who has been complimented by women who have been stalking them.
In the TV series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattarensis) it is not the most worrying image of its powerful image, for example, images of hanged bodies and out of the eye. The most alarming is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a surprising short distance.
The aim of sex robots is to do as much as it is technically possible for real women to do (at the proportions of porn stars).
Robot developers want their skin to feel real and motion to imitate human movements as well as possible.
However, their "personalities" are far from the reality.
The robot can't leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — no violation of the fantasy of independence or complete surrender.
They are pleasant servants.

Police suspect: Australia was planning two terrorist acts, a group led by the head of the Isis Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief Chief of the Chief of the Chief Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief of the Chief Chief of the Chief of the Chief Chief of the Chief of Chief Chief of the Chief Chief of
The head of the Isisi Association was led by a group of Australianmen, which is suspected to be about to take a bomb into the aircraft of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the leading bodies of the Daddys had also sent Sydney the building blocks of the bomb.
According to the doubt that the bomb was intended to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company was interrupted before the security check came to an end.
The police won't tell us exactly why the company stopped.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a toxicly coloured gas-fired device and take the device to a public location, such as a public means of transport.
Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
Four men were caught in police raids on Saturday because of suspected terrorist plans.
One of the men has been released, but his interviews will continue as well.
The good side of the beach?
Get Mitt Romeney to show a sense of reason.
It has already been repeated until the end of the rough season that the strong question of voters has broken up families at the arc level as well.
On Christmas and Thanksgiving terms, the American newspaper’s advisory papers provided guidance on how to deal with the families who voted for the Trum Olympics.
We all want our resting information bubbles.
To a lesser extent, the Trump's ability to connect families has been ignored.
I'm telling you this because my cousin visited me in New York this week, and he's a left-wing poet who's been living in Chicago with the Republicans of our family for a long time now.
He reminded me that a common enemy could have a powerful combined effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins – including a sister who supports Republicans, who has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At the dinner table, it's a good thing, but in the broader sense, there are significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new flow, but the distorting effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalization", we talk about the frightening possibility that one day we will no longer be able to terrorize his tricks.
In the long term, it is even more horrific that Trump normalises the right-wing Republicans, which, compared to Trump, suddenly seem quite reasonable.
I remember Mitt Romney's slow version of madness: dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (and we've seen his tax returns at all), compared to Trump, they seem to be very mild infractions.
Once the Trump season is over, the next presidential candidate of the Republicans must be clear, and it seems like a considerable improvement.
When my cousin came to visit me, we took our children to the Carousel in Central Park, which is the biggest carousel in New York Park, and the best one in New York for three dollars without caffeine.
The horses of the bear are huge, the characters in the middle – loose clowns and the animals behind the terror – are evil and the music behind the background is strangely fascinating.
Many of New York's characteristics are disappointing over time: the views of high buildings start to get bored, the town's silhouette becomes too familiar and the city's reality does not match dreams.
And yet, after 35 years, I've been through the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cabin, but a large circuit of traffic in North London. Yes Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss spirit pub, but it is not calculated.
On the other hand, the carousel of the Central Park remains a strange or magical experience – even to the extent that two two two two-years, one eleven-year-old and two forty-year-old women enjoy it enormously.
I would have given the carousel a full score if someone had asked me for my assessment, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week to assess my "pay experience" by a step of one five stars before I put my credit card in a locked machine.
The same thing in my coffee shop at home, but it also gives me the opportunity to combine an estimate of 15% of the service fee when I go myself to get coffee from a bag.
This slows down the daily interaction and pressures the customer’s servant to put his person into a game in a situation where it is not necessary.
The dealer of the store smiled when I was tired of giving my credit card five letters for the user experience.
Shefki Kuqi was fired from Inter. "There was no trust in leadership."
FC Inter today has released Shefki Kuq's association with the mission team's coach duties.
The training responsibility is taken by Fabrizio Piccaret, who previously worked as a assistant coach.
Other training teams will continue to carry out their current tasks.
Italy’s Piccareta has previously served as a assistant coach in, among other things, English in Sunderland, England.
In January, 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter coaching team, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of FC Inter, regrets about what happened.
Exchange of trainers is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the management of the Society, which means that there was no other option now, Håkans commented on the follow-up information.
The Piccareta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He and the other training team are responsible for this morning's home game against HIFK.
According to the news of the nights, the team has drowned down the Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the team's assistant coach Piccare and John Allen have been moved aside.
Kuqi and Piccareta were strongly brought together in the Inter match against PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published his youth picture in the '80s... would you recognize a serious violin student?
Christmas artist Linda Lampenius published a youth picture on Instagram.
A number of speakers have been added to the picture which suggests that the musician is a 16-year-old student of Sibelius Academy.
Lampenius himself wonders about the young woman who looks at the camera as a serious piece.
A long time ago, serious, he'll send you a message.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it from here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful topics.
A year ago, he published an image of himself on Instagram.
In the second picture, he is seen 20 years ago, and the other one is postponing now, as a mother of two children.
In his description, Lampenius wonders about his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders that he suffered when he was younger than he did.
Exactly 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius wrote.
After he had added to English Hashtagian life, eating disorder, uncertainty, confidence, self-esteem, love self, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, a woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating shocks over past years.
He was already 14 years old in a hospital for anorex and orthox.
A little later, he also became ill with his bulimia, which was eventually discovered only in 2006.
The healing started to begin with a little bit.
In addition to the therapist and the parable, Lampenius helped to develop a new love.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to a hospital because of chest pains in the chest.
This is the second time that Pstorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for the cuts on his wrists that he, according to the prison officials, got after he fell in a cell.
The penitentiary was convicted of murder by the prosecutors of the original death penalty.
He killed Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting several shots through the WC door at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorus claimed that he thought his girlfriend was the night-nighter who was hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have told me that they intend to complain again because they consider the judgment of Mr Pistorius for six years too mild.
The D.A. intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint may already be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of the Bishop may extend to 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal conduct in war in Greece.
Two Russians who were illegally engaged were arrested in Greece, reported the State Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the basis of a bTV channel.
The police arrested a bunch of people who had been admitted to camp in Sidonia on the morning of August 1st, and there were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were released on the same day, but the investigation is still ongoing.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released the Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for free camping areas and have already imposed significant fines on all those who are encamping in areas other than those reserved for their purpose.
The inspections shall be carried out until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to impose a fine may be imposed.

Red meat, dairy products and chocolates may relieve the symptoms of upset bowel syndrome.
Red meat and chocolate may sound like the nightmares of the digestive system.
However, the recent study points to the opposite: a high level of meat protein and a diet containing dairy products may make it easier for an irritant bowel syndrome.
An acute bowel syndrome is an uncontrolled disease of approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom. It causes stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at Washington University found that protein contains essential amino acid tryptophan to help the body develop immune cells that strengthen the ability of the intestine to provide more resistance to the gut.
According to Chief of Research Marco Colonna, immune cells were guarding the family and ensure that the food does not contain harmful microbes that can access the body.
Infective cells that balance the cells that cause infections, which strengthen your tolerance, protect your body without harming the sensitive tissues.
If the balance drops too close to the infection, the result may be an irritant bowel syndrome.
The tests have shown that the immune cells that enhance the tolerance are found in mice with a certain bacterial in their intestines.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to start the immune cells. Tryptophan is one of the protein building materials.
"We have found a link between the development of Lactobacillus rheter bacteria and the development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus rheter is part of the intestinal normal microbial disease", Professor Colonna says.
"The more mouse diet was tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus rheuteri bacteria and a high diet containing tryptophan, can strengthen the intestinal tolerance and reduce the susceptibility to inflammation.
When examining immunoassay cells, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one mouse group had such cells, there were no mice of the same species of mice kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the gastrointestinal microbiomas of mice, i.e. the gastrointestinal tract to the community of bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When DNA was studied in mice, there were six bacterial species found in mice with immune cells, but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus router bacteria were administered to mice that did not have intestinal microbioma and who did not develop immune cells, they began to develop immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, and they raised Lactobacillus router bacteria in the fluid and transferred small amounts of fluid without bacteria to the immune cells isolated from the mouse.
Immunocytes developed into cells that enhance the ability to enhance fertility.
When the active ingredient was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indoli-3-matic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of cells that strengthened the tolerance increased by about 50%. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells fell half the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same tolerance-enhancing cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus router bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether or not the side effects of tryptophan are allowed to develop in humans the same way as in mice. However, gene errors associated with Tryptophan have been observed in patients with newly awakened bowel syndrome.
"We probably want to contribute to the development of such cells because they regulate the inflammation on the gut's internal surfaces," says Cervantes-Barragan.
The high level of tryptophan in combination with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their increase."
Jose Mourinho considers Manchester United has been awarded a "neron" in his line after concluding an agreement with Nemanja Mat with Nemanja Matic and with Nemanja Mat.
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has been awarded a "neron" contract since he signed a contract with Nemanja Matic. The middle field player debuted Manchester United in the row of the fight against Sampdor on Wednesday night.
The Matic, who moved from Chelsea by 40 million pounds, started a two-to-one victory in Dublin, in the United's last round before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He was impressed by a defensive middle-field player against stars like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Math was not yet in the best condition because he was not involved in the tour of blue shirts in Asia until the beginning of the season. He took only 45 minutes on the field – according to Mourinho, there must be a change before the beginning of the election period.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, and his way of thinking make him a genius – he has natural football thinking ability", Mouriho says.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Math, the newcomers Victor Lindelof and Romulue Lock was about to start the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho started to slice his start-up meeting for the beginning of the season.
Indecent revealed this week that Mourinho wants three more new players, even though the Society has already done "a brilliant job" by obtaining three of his four priority players.
"The third of four – it must be given thanks to the company," he added.
"I'm happy if I have all four, but they did excellent work."
For two hours, balloons bulled Germany for two periods of time from two seasons to two seasons.
The Finnish women's volleyball team lost its fourth match of World Cup tournament directly to Germany from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
German routine playing is high.
Their game was in every sector, the Finnish Chief Coach Tapio Kangasniemi reported on the bulletin.
In the first two sections, Finland was holding its opponents on the track, but in the third part Germany was clearly stronger than Germany.
Germany is leading the block.
When we were patient and aggressive enough in certain places, we were able to play along, Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most powerful 14 points had been collected by Pika Korhonen.
Three matches of four lost Finland will face Slovenia on Sunday again.
Reuters: A large jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr. on the occasion of the Russia meeting with Trump Jr. Russia.
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges in connection with the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
A large jury called by Robert Mueller has already sent challenges in connection with the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and the Russian attorney known for the Krems, Natalia Vesselnitskaya.
This is about the news firm Reuters, which, at the same time, confirms the fact that Wall Street Journal was involved in inviting a large jury together earlier on Thursday.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges to a meeting between Trump Jr and the Kml-related Veselnitskaya, which was held in June of the US presidential election held in June 2016.
There was also Donald Trump Sr’s campaign manager Paul Manafort and his son-in-law, the current adviser to the White House Jared Kushner.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has called together a large jury in Washington, U.S.A., means the collapse of the Russian investigation pattern.
The sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to assist an investigation into Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether Trump's campaign or close cooperation with his family in the matter with Russia.
The grand jury extends Mueller's rights to collect evidence, to send challenges and to force people to testify on a solemn basis.
There is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury will consider the evidence that the prosecutor has examined and decide whether the case should be brought in.

In the first place, the British invented himself in the whole country so that he can open his home door, get into his office and start his car with a shake of his hand.
The microsiru is between the 33-year-old Steven Northam's thumb and the front finger. Now he provides services to businesses and individuals who want to facilitate their lives with the technology of the Northam BioTeq company.
Northam is working with Geoff Watson, an anesthetic doctor at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hants.
The microchip uses a technique similar to that used in cats and dogs for microchips, and it only takes 30 seconds to install it.
The company also transforms the locks of houses and cars into compatible microchips. One lock processing costs 300 pounds.
He's married, and he's got one child, and he's put microchip technology in his home and BMW Z4 car, which starts when he puts his hand on the steering wheel.
Your show for the White White House show cost thousands of thousands of dollars to pay taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay for the taxpayers to pay the taxpayers to pay the
The last decision of the White House is to fly the Navy helicopter to the southern lawnmower of the White House for an American production event had to be paid to taxpayers for $24,000.
A green Sikorsky VH-3D helikikopter uses the name Marine One when the President is on his ride. It was a appeal for an event held in the White House on 17 July7, where American building programs were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a number of officials from the White House were familiar with products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a truck from Mississip.
The White House Military Office had requested a helicopter on a specific mission order only about 36 hours before landing on the southern lawn to a "exclusive" event, which is reflected in the documents of the Navy HMX-1 HelicopterValade.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of the matter because this is an exceptional event that gets a lot of visibility", the HMX-1 unit commander wrote in an e-mail to his superior, who is the assistant commander of the Navy Air Operation Commander, on the day before the event.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at 17.7. seven in the morning and the event would start in three afternoons. The helicopter would only leave the site after the lawn field was empty between 6 and 9 in the evening.
In addition, the communication mentioned that if the helicopter left the White House delayed, another crew would be required due to restrictions on service times.
The original crew was in the helicopter for the time of the event, and the unit's security personnel were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
The documents received by the TIMA newspaper do not make it clear whether another crew was ultimately required.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 asked if the event would break the law.
"One of our questions was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act.
"It sounds like you can participate", the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political tone.
At that time, the President spoke in favour of the reform of the health care system that had been processed by the Senate and the more looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One helicopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them on their journeys,
but their use for photos is unusual.
The efforts of the Trump took note of the fact that Air Force One rolled the president’s campaign on the back of Melbourne’s campaign in Florida state. Trump has strongly criticised the use of its predecessor’s presidential aircraft on Twitter.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, which introduced products from all 50 states produced by American workers from American materials", said Lindsay Walters, Press Secretary for the White House.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and practice in the southern lawnfield to the exact accuracy of the President's introduction to the White House.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 exercises for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America included a crew member’s monthly training quota.
The unit's helicopters were also operated on that day for 11 hours in non-premises support missions.
According to the White House, the event did not involve any other cost to taxpayers.
Sikorsky's editor told me that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter demonstration in the southern lawnfield of the White House.
HMX-1 has no record of flights related to the President's duties, and it is difficult to accurately assess the costs of the event.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s hourly compensation for the year 2017, the compensation level of VH-3D helicopters is EUR 24 380 per flight hour.
According to HMX-1 unit documents, flights from Quantico base to the White House from Virginia to the White House and they lasted for an hour.
According to the White House, the cost of operation of the helicopter is clearly lower than the cost of operation of the helicopter.
"The calculation of the cost to the taxpayers according to the level of compensation is misleading", Walters says.
"The adjusted level of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other so-called "integrated costs, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the survey carried out by the RAND Research Company in 2015, compensation levels do not include personnel costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
During the time of the event, former press secretary Sean Spicer, the White House, defended the use of the helicopter during the event.
"The idea is to introduce American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the Connecticut state are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus certainly employ hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is entirely relevant to state it."
It is not certain whether Trump went to the helicopter during the event, but at least he sat on the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump made a joke to the press about his own Sikorsky band.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said. "I have three."
The lightning hit the Vaasa track - the trains will have to be replaced by a bus to replace them with a bus.
The passenger trains between the Wall River and Vaasa are across the board because of technical failure, notifying the Railway Centre.
The trains are replaced by busses for the time being.
The traffic control system failure was caused by a thunderstorm.
In the morning, there was no estimate of the duration of the repair by the Railway Centre.
The Venezuela State Prosecutor's State Prosecutor requires the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country from appointing a new representative.
The Venezuelan State Prosecutor has applied for a court decision which would prevent the country from appointing a new representative.
Mr Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has announced that last Sunday's vote on the election of the elected representative is intended to be held on Friday.
A delegation, which may, inter alia, amend the Constitution of the country, was elected to the country in the vote in question.
According to Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, an anti-circumstantial decision has been requested because of the problems of the electoral system.
Ortega has also started the vote on the polling survey.
He appointed two judges after the British company which organised the election of the delegation said that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of actual voters.
Only allies of Maduro were nominated for representation, and the elected 555 members' representatives include, inter alia, the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to changing the Constitution, the delegation may break down the Congress under the opposition and change the laws.
Maduroa was described as a dictator to be a dictator, described as a dictator to be a dictator by Maduroa.
The actions of the madro are widely condemned.
The opposition considers the amendment of the Constitution to be a way for Maduro to strengthen its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and has called this a dictator.
For its part, the European Union, Britain, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they will not recognise the new delegation.
Maduro claims that the new delegation is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, tensions have been going on for months.
They've been wounded by numerous people, and over 100 have died.
Venezuela fell to an economic crisis after the oil price dropped.
Now many people can't afford food or medicine.
The opposition is also expected to show its opinion on Friday, when the new delegation is due to begin.
A Russian- surrender Russian leader who was granted to prison in the United States, U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U. U
In the U.S. Court of Minneapolis, on Thursday, the 41-year-old Maksim Senah was sentenced to four years of imprisonment to participate in a worldwide computer conversation.
In August 2015, Senah was arrested as a result of the requirement made by the United States of America.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontankka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was returning home.
Finland submitted Senah to the US judicial authorities in February 2016, despite Russian protests, reports AFP.
He was found guilty of computer fraud this March of this year, with millions of dollars in profit.
Senah received 46 months of imprisonment.
According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Senah is deported after the execution of the detention warrant.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia strongly abused Finland after the arrest and said that no man should be released to the United States.
In its opinion, Finland and the United States were congratulated on the fact that the arrest was made in Finland without Russia's prior knowledge of the arrest.
According to the state's attorney, Senah had used a computer virus called Ebury that grabbed tens of thousands of computers all over the world.
With the help of the virus, user names and passwords were fished.
The frauds then used data by continuing to direct internet traffic, which was used to make click-offs and to disseminate spam.
According to Kenneth Blanco, Director of the Ministry of Justice, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt other cybercrime active.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the press.

Gilbert Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denise) is the brain of it. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) handles connections to Mexico, and Chepe Santacuz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
Recently announced trailer Pedro Pascal makes his return to Javier Peña, who recruits US and Colombian police officers for the war on drugs.
New faces are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Wheel, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production season of Narcos begins on 1 September.
Kari Kola implements an extraordinary photography work in Paris to take place in Paris.
The first Light Day set by the United Nations will be held in Paris next May of 16 May in the year following the year in which the artist Kari Kola (beginal) carried out an exceptional photography work.
Kola does a photo work in Paris called Day and Night.
The works are done by light and darkness - day and night - sun and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building of Unesco headquarters and the Globe monument on its behalf.
I would like to highlight, in addition to light, the darkness as well as the light.
Today, the EUR million level is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us today.
With the help of my art, I can make things that I have experienced tangiblely visible to you," says lighting artist Kari Kola about his work.
I'm well-introduced to be involved in the first international light day and bring photography into the agenda, Kola will continue.
Kari Kola was involved in the opening of the Valo anniversary in 2015, when he lit the celebration in honor of the Grand Hall of Unesco.
I feel very privileged to perform my art again at Unesco headquarters," says Kari Kola.
The work may be expanded to a very significant extent.
This will be reported later in the coming autumn, and Kola will continue.
The aim of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of science, art, culture and sustainable development sectors.
The first Light Day will be celebrated at Unesco headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.

Two men were born with a dispute in Espoo, the shopping center of the capital of Omena parking garage in the Wednesday morning morning.
According to the parties, the dispute was initiated when the other party accidentally drove the prohibited route of driving.
There was an oral dispute between the drivers.
The driver who drove the ban along the drive line would fool another car driver, resulting in which the car took off running into the hitter's car.
After this, he hit a car on the plane.
In the provisional statement, a man has admitted that he had caused injury and did so wrong.
The article entitled "After that, there became a flood" by Timo's question mark.
Foreign Minister Timo Soini (U.S.) published a blog edition on Thursday, titled as a question mark.
The article is short, only two times in size.
During my time, the party grew from zero to thirty-seven representatives as a government party.
Then came the flooding, now everything floats, Soini writes.
The text of the soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
King Ludvig XV or his mistress Madame de Pompadouri is known to have used the waterbath comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, history's books have been frozen by "the flooding of the water after us" or "the flooding after me".
According to the UN UN, Afghanistan's democracy depends on women's political role in the political role of democracy depends on the political role women play.
Elections are only representative if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote for the UN Head of Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the interim director of the UN Assistance Mission, stated that hundreds of women are on stand for the elections of the Councils of State, three women are seeking to be Vice-President, and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphaised", Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can be truly representative and credible only if women participate fully in them and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
The Government of Afghanistan and the Presidential elections shall be held on 5-17.
Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as international troops are moving to an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that the power will move from a peacefully democratically elected government to another government.
Haysom said that women's contribution to strengthening Afghanistan's democracy was strengthened by women's democracy.
According to the International Election Commission for Afghanistan, 1.2 million women are women from 3.6 million registered voters.

The authorities are considering limiting the number of tourists in Venice.
In particular, local rage is directed at the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and flee" tourism: there are only a few hours in the target, and we are rushing through the great crowds of attractions.
Russia is going to suffocate fast day trips to tourists making up the city.
It is hard to move on the streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the people of Venice are no longer able to get together.
They have been forced to move further away from the historic centre, while hotels have arrived at the house.
The New York Times and The Guardian are writing about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities are considering restrictions on tourist rates.
They call the current phenomenon poor-quality tourism - low-quality tourism.
When you arrive on a large cruise ship, you will be given two or three hours.
You will follow the ticket guide to the bridge of Piazzale Romalta Rialton and the market of St. Markus, and you will turn back, describe the situation of Italian Minister of Culture, Dario Franceschini, and the tourism that causes problems.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in the architecture but also in the operations of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the urban identity.
St. Mark's Square is also one of the most popular visits to the historic centre of Venice.
The church of St. Mark's Church is located on the sides of the market.
Local anger is also mainly directed at cruise ships.
50 000 locals live in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1951, the population was about 175,000.
In July, an estimated 2 000 Russians expressed their opinion against mass tourism.
They believe that tourism has undermined their quality of life, destroys the environment and drives the residents away.
Some 2 000 people leave each year.
If this continues, in a few years' time there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, which was in order of demonstration.
Equally, it is difficult for ships to bring the hard-needed income to Venice and create the need for a number of jobs in various sectors.
In addition to limiting the number of tourists, it has been envisaged that cruisers would go further than the historic centre.
In the opinion of Luciano Bortot, in Venice, the situation would certainly change if the administrative area of Venice, where Venice is located, had more power to decide on its own matters - if not full autonomy had been achieved.
About 20 to 30 million tourists are visited every year in Venice.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the freeway by engine, the weights of the bad miles [ bad km] of congestions are on the freeway.
On the north side of the motorway between Kuopio and Siiliärvi, on Thursday afternoon's work, there have been miles of congestion from the return journey to the north of the motorway between Kuopio and Siilinjärvi.
The area is equipped with road coating work, which slows traffic down, says Savo Sanomat.
For roadways, there is a maximum speed limit of 50 km per hour instead of a normal speed of 120 km.
Even in a 50-kilometre restricted area, traffic had been moving forward on Thursday afternoons, however, in practice, by walking speed.
The roads went on Thursday afternoon on the Siiliärve side of the Revelation statue, or the golden bear.
I get along well without such attention.
The 23-year-old runner has had to notice the church of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful images of himself in the landscapes of Grand Canyon, among other things.
Danish-Nordic Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in its present country in Norway, not least because he broke the Norwegian record of 26 in March 400 metres in the run-up of Norway during the cycle on 51.81.
A month later, he improved the 40-meter fence ride at the time of the Norwegian record at 55.38.
After his record, Iuel, who once used social media, soon discovered that fame and publicity had a shadow.
Men around the world began sending pictures of their sexual organs to Iuel in the hope that a young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel had to close down from outside his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "pastics" from unknown people, so I had to make my account private, and Iuel told VG.
Iuel did not want to identify in the VG interview exactly what images he received.
You guess Iuel laughed.
It's nice to have feedback after the run, but I'm doing well without any other kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
His mother is Danish, Father Danish-Norder.
Iuel's family moved to Norway when Amalie was 2 years old.
When Amalie was a 12-year-old family, Dad moved to Namibia first because of his work, then to Pakistan.
After that, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he exchanged Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel will practice with the guidance of three coaches, Leif Olav Alnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
Norway is much more open to debate than the United States.
In the United States, trainers ask for nothing but regulations.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to be personally involved with the athlete, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel holds the records of Norway at 400 metres and 400 meters in a fence.
On the feet, snowboarder Janne Korve took the whole career at the stake - now involved in the World Cup: "It's nice not to get anywhere"
It's been nice counting since nothing happened.
Janne Korpi, 31 of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has once again been able to enjoy their beloved species again in this season.
Last summer, the career extension was at stake.
The pressure on the foot table had been forced by Korve's operating table in January, and the foot didn't want to heal at all.
The hand had been hit in a car accident.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether it's going to be a ferry or not.
The sponsor's accounts were broken and a lot of things were open, Kapp says.
But what they're saying is that things are usually going to be okay.
The leg improved, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood began again pulling to the chest.
After that, the decision was easy.
I knew it at the latest when I was on snow one time.
I was just so fucking funny. Let's have a couple more.
It was only in September to October, but after a long fall, it's been a big deal after a long break.
There's only a few of the karpies around.
It's okay.
The competitions have never been the most important aspect of the boarding.
I've never counted for one race.
I think it's frustrating to be in one race for four years, and then you're in a fever that week.
I can't think about it, Kapp says.
Today, the korpi küpsat in the Halfpipe of the World Cups in Sierra Nevada, Spain.
Although individual races don't like him with a ride, he always lights up when he's in a tough crowd.
According to the basket, the appreciation of the competitions organised by the International Ski Federation has increased over recent years, although some of the boarders chose Norway X-Games at the same time.
It's a big race. It's a big view.
In my opinion, however, appreciation always depends on the circumstances and the level of the competitions involved.
Korpi is the oldest athlete of the Finnish 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
Team weights, 17-year-old Rene Rinnekan and Emmi Parkkinenniemi, are Korpea 14 years younger than their age.
It's nice to follow up with older friends.
I remember when myself was at the point that everything was new and was so sick of everything.
It's a new power for itself, and Korp's wondering.
When I'm on the line, there's still some way I'm gonna stick around, but otherwise I don't, there's plenty of power in my friends.
In the background of the game career, Janne Korpi has also built a different sport career.
The director legend Pekka Korve's son is entrenched to therapeutic sports: the director has his own health care horses for whom he makes training programs.
When I'm on a trip all the time, that's not enough time for that to be in the fair.
But I look at the food results at least every day, and I usually see something coming, Korp tells me.
Management and medical training are according to Korve as a potential career plan when the boarding career is complete in due time.
I'm not planning that far, but at least it's a likely option.
I'm going to get it so I'm going to be a little like studying it right here, along with this snowboarding.
I'm just trying to keep my mind on and on, maybe in summer, there might be some kind of departures.
If it's my future profession, then it's not hard to start when it's already done inside the species.
The drug business also includes Elitloppet-revirisation to be carried out with the carrier Jaajo Linnonmaa.
The twin has rented a cruise ship to Stockholm at the end of May at the Elitloppet therapeutic contest in late May.
Corp and Linnonmaa decided to relive the old tradition.
The cruise has gone well to trade, and people have been excited about it.
We're already at the point that there's not going to be any bankruptcy.
There are a few months left. Let's hope we can get the ship filled, Korpi says it's excited.
I've had all the surprises to Kite of all of this to Mrs. Kite, but I've had all of this surprises to Mrs. Kite.
Ms Ester is the name of a new nurse home of 41-year-olds built for Kite.
The building of an up to 1,700 floor-infrastructurer is expected to be completed next summer across the Health Services next to the health centre’s neighbor.
The problem of general wonder is where a new care unit is sufficient for customers, as now during Siu's war, many private clinics are going to kick the customer's weight.
Anne Flink Addendo, Regional Director of Care Services, commented that Kite will have more demand in the future, not only for options but also for improved service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are alternatives, freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Annando bought private clinics from Kitei in Kanervkkola and Eerika.
The deal was business, but the real estate is reported to be a five-year lease agreement.
Fllink says that Addendo does not have an acute need to move activities out of these facilities.
I'll see you later on this.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand of McVitie's brand in Scotland.
The trade union will apply for a long-term commitment from the CEO of McVitie's to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to GMB Scotland Section of the General Trade Union for the United Kingdom, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
There are over 500 employees who manufacture Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products.
Pladis, a company owned by McVitie's brand, reported that he invested more than 5 million pounds in the factory in recent years.
The company added that workers and trade union representatives "are sure to be replaced first" if there are changes to take place.
In its letter to the Executive Director, GMB urges the company "to take care that no funding has been provided for the modernisation of production lines".
The GMB Trade Union Drew Duffy is very concerned about the fact that the factory manager is not clear about the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been strongly concentrated in the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and incomes and of the continued reduction in Brexit, rising living costs and production, Eastern Glasgow needs successful McVitie's production.'
According to the media editor, the director had received a letter from the trade union only on the previous day and the company will be directly responsible for the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction with employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross two months ago, when we had an open debate on a number of issues.
We discussed with employees, among other things, the fact that, like other very competitive and uncertain companies in the market, we assessed all our transactions and continuously operate in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the press, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the Tollcross plant in recent years, in particular in its production lines and in improving its operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production plant and we will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory".
Did the PSG warn Barcelona about the transfer of Neymar three years ago?
Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratat.
Saint Saint-Germain will not give up the pursuit of Neymar after payment of a sum of $189 million for the termination of the transfer agreement, but did the PSG warn Barcelona about a record transfer three years ago?
The French Ligue 1 football team is ready to break the world record of the transfers. The previous record was less than half the size of Paul Pogba’s return to Manchester United with a sum of 89 million pounds.
After the transfer, Neymar becomes the world's most expensive football player and also the world's best paid professional athlete, because PSG provides him with over 500 000 pounds of weekly salary after taxes.
The source near Barcelona tells us that the Society has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the Chairman of the PSG warn the football world about this move three years ago?
When Manchester City announced that he was interested in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best players of the PSG.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they find out about our players, we'll be their opponents and we'll contact their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they find out about our players, they'll have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have done just this: it expressed its interest in Marco Compared earlier this summer to the PSG’s mid-field player Marco.
The PSG made it clear that it would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona will therefore lose its Star Player Neymar.

NYT: The calls Trump made were invented - the White House editor: "I wouldn't say it was a lie"
The White House acknowledges that two calls from the US President Donald Trump never happened, reports the New York Times magazine.
The calls that Trump smoked with both the President of Mexico and the leader of the Party Organisation have proved to have been invented.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House editor, confirmed that there had been no calls.
But he said that Trump didn't lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump had been discussing with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the Hamburg G20 meeting.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty strong accusation.
Those discussions were made, not just on the phone, but on the face, Sanders justified it.
The speech of the parties raised the bad news.
Trump told me that on Monday the President of Mexico called him and said that Trump had succeeded in fighting against illegal migration.
According to the Trump, Pena Nieto told me that rarely will be across the southern border of Mexico, because they know that the journey will in any case be a waste of time on the U.S. border.
On Wednesday, the Mexican Government published a notice in which it said that this call had not been made.
Tuesday Politico published a complete version of Trump's interview with The Wall Street Journal.
In that regard, Trump welcomed the talk at a large meeting of the National Coastal Party Organisation in Western Virginia.
I got a call from the head of patrol boys, he said it was the greatest speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the patrol agency informed that it was not aware of any of its executives' calls to Trump.
According to the information, the previous statement by Michael Surbaugh, the director of the organization, in which he had asked Trump for his apology from the Boy Scouts, speaks his side of himself.
Trump's speech at the meeting of the party organisation raised a great deal of uncertainty, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
Among other things, he undermined the results of last fall's presidential election.
