Take this off.
He won his love.
He missed a class.
Can you give me that cup?

We're home today.
I saw Tom dancing with another girl.
No one was in the room.

It was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
My mother didn't say that.

Why are you restless?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
Last night there was a fire near us.
Better go, Tom.

Stand straight.
Thania's job is temporary.
I hope it's good.
It doesn't matter.
You've always been like this.
The sun died under the horizon and blacked out.
Which side won which one?

I hate that movie.
That was yesterday.
I'll tie my shoes.
Where did you take off your gloves?
It's disgusting.
The nearest city is behind the hills.
Are you reading now?
There are musicians and actors who hire security guards to keep away from them their too enthusiastic fans.
Shall we go to the movies now?
I know you can do that.
It's not known for Tom.
Those were his last words.
Tom's favorite sport is baseball.
I'm really mad.
At first I was disappointed.

When he was young, only the children of rich families had a spiritual talk.
The crystal clear water was very pleasant.
There was nothing else to do.
We know a solution.
The new school has failed to take into account the particular needs of young people.
Come on, please.
Everything that happened between us was a lie?
That's the picture.
That's close enough.
Get up on the bike.
I'm glad you're here, Tom.

Don't leave me alone.
I'd like some coffee.
There are plenty of flowers in the garden.
Tom laughed too loud.
The answer was simple.
You shouldn't have come so early.

He offered it to me.
That's unusual.
Capitalism is not forced to buy.
She was shocked by this terrible scene.
It doesn't matter to me what happens.

He's not here right now.
Don't be stupid.
He took her home.
I don't wish anyone to die.

Did they hurt you?
I'll let Tom know.
I should have been more precise.
And how do you know that?
I want to see you.

I told him that I would do the best I could.
Looks like I don't need to be here.
I'd like something to eat.
Thank you for not saying "I told you".
Everything's back to normal.

There's another man in his life.
You speak Chinese good?
I'll be there tonight.
When we got back, there were only eight teams left by then.
What do you mean, U.S.A.?
I lived there for five years.

Tom cares about his own business.
It doesn't fit to look at others.
This is the same for everyone.

I'd be unhappy, but I wouldn't kill myself.
Fix the watch.
We're looking for a shoulder.
Once again.
Be careful, this could be a trap.
I can't take it that long from my wife.
The country still has no clear definition of what it means.
It's a big world.

I know who he is.
I should have denied you to do that.
Tom's going to be really angry.
Why are you doing this now?
Shut up and do what they say to you.
What a wonderful performance.
I can't drive a car.
Tomi, everyone, wished for Christmas.
Down with corrupt politicians.
Tomi left the company in 2013.
Tom and Mary were both home.
She's afraid of that dog.
I want to buy a dozen donuts.
He sent me a rope.
She's jealous.
Tom doesn't have much time to relax.
Tom wants to try.
Tell me where you were last night at the time of the murder.

We're half an hour after midnight.

A small chance I'll make it to the meeting.
They weren't there.
Well done.
I'm tired.
I don't remember ever getting tired of working, although nothing is completely exhausted.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
We compared Tom and Mary's work.
This is the new model.
No one has left except Tom.
I didn't die.
You know who said that?
We're exhausted.
He wants you dead.
I'll pay you back.
This was just before John came up with an idea. John always knew a way out of apparently hopeless situations.

Are you all right?
I think he's the best friend I've ever seen.
Give me a day.
Today's luck is on my side.
Please tell me your name.

I named my daughter Nairu and wished her a long life.
How did you know Tom was going to Boston?

He's weighing 50 pounds.
Tomi tried to expose her frustration.
