The winner of the right-wing popular in Austria, totalling 29 percent.
Two parties to the grand coalition so far and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have been brought to the conclusion that the first preliminary results of the parliamentary elections in Austria have been held on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously hit by severe losses, especially in the face of severe losses.
By contrast, the President of the Federal Republic of Austria (BZÖ), the Head of the Province of Karindia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a victory return to national politics.
On the basis of the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country is the Socialist Party (SPÖ) to remain 29.8% of the votes, but in comparison with the last elections in 2006 he lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25,6 percent.
The worst results achieved so far in the history of the two major parties in Austria's post-war history and, in particular, the result of the People's Party who raised the pre-elected elections is essentially disastrous.
At the beginning of July, at the end of the ÖVP coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage before SPÖ according to the polls of public opinion.
However, the voters apparently punished the government because they let the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculations have already been made on the possible withdrawal of Lieutenant Wilhelm Molterer and the current start-aller.
The observers believe that this could be done on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the parties.
This development would probably make it easier for the election outcome to make it easier for us to move forward, i.e. the renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - 18 percent of the votes in advance (FPÖ) and 11 percent of the votes in advance - however, the Socialist Democrats expressed their fears at the same time as regards the re-employment of 1999 when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was even uniform at the time, in 2005 he became a member of the BZÖ), which even brought sanctions on behalf of the European Union.
Hader, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics, obviously this is the solution.
The Green Party has also reached Parliament, but some of its lost popularity, and the Austrian political parties have returned from third place to fifth place.
None of the other parties crossed the four hundred-dollar limit, and they didn't make it to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: The Indian relations may get cold if they are in contact with the Indian relations with Schwarzenberg: They can get cold out.
If it were not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists for the illegal collection of bugs, according to the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain risk in Czech-India relations.
The Minister did so in New York after his meeting with Pranab Mukherji, India's partner today.
"If that didn't work out, yes, there would be a certain cold relief," he said after the meeting that took place in Czech encouragement.
Mukherji, after the trial, told me that enforcement power could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, which was dismissed and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local management of Darjeeling, which is subject to the law of the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
However, according to Mukherji, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be best to appeal to a higher court.
Then you can apply for immunity against bail and wait for the sentence, he explained.
Schwarzenberg proved that his partner expressed similar views during the trial as well.
"He proposed an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to rescue him," said the head of the Czech Diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech Party can intervene in this matter is to provide the convicted with "comply legal support", said the Indian Minister.
However, he said that the Indian fear has already provided them with such help.
"Our primary interest in maintaining best connections with India with many years' leave.
The Indians also admit that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as you told the ESC, your partner stressed that the Czech Republic is of great importance to the problem of Czech ethologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he declared.
Ask yourself whether the Indian party received a promise to deal with the matter, the minister answered the question.
"I received relatively many promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed.
He goes to the wall electronic map, on which Australia and neighbouring sea areas are visible.
However, he does not care about the continent, but he cares about a prominent point in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and is also a neighboring seabed with it.
In the field as the continent itself," says Luigi Santosostos, Italian lawyer, who is a group of thirty-members of UN Division's ocean and maritime law cases.
His boss, Mikulka Mikulka Czech lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which sometimes complements it.
This is where employment and enthusiasm prevails.
The seabed is rich in natural resources, and so far has hardly known.
Oil,érc and other minerals can be found here, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, can be the key to the development of medicines against cancer.
Seabeds greater than land-landerer seabeds greater than seabeds above ground
The coastal states are currently looking intensively for new sub-sea areas.
According to the UN Convention, rights are exercised, which were agreed in 1982 in the Jamaican Montego Bay.
It is mainly the territory of the so-called Continental secretariat, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coasts of the country concerned.
Such a country has exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the Continental Secretariat.
"With simplification, we keep the surface of the seabed part and under the floor of the continent, which is naturally continued below the sea's surface.
The coastal sea borders, often two hundred miles across the border only the economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by that country to the Commission setting out the external borders of the Continent Board shall be supplemented by a number of comprehensive scientific documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three mentioned countries have succeeded," says Mikulka.
In the world, the success of Australia has recently taken place, which has first substantially expanded its sub-sealy country.
But New Zealand has also won - the seabed area of the seabed assessed for the committee is approximately 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. six times the territory of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
They hope that the return on future use of seabed will be invaluable.
Other countries also continue to submit their applications.
They can do so within ten years of the moment of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the Continental Secretariat ends, the Convention shall enter into the area of the oceanbed declared by the “common heritage of humanity” declared by the Convention.
There is no longer a single country having an exclusive situation here.
The right of extraction shall be granted in this area by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, saying that "one area was legally clearly surrounded and laid down in a contract for their regime".
Czechs in the Pacific Ocean
Part of the seabed is now part of the Czech Republic.
This former Eastern Block is divided into other countries within the framework of the Common World Trade Association.
This organisation received the so-called 'passenger investor' status in 1991, just like the investors in some other countries.
It has been authorised to produce the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is somewhat greater than its former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is in the seabed, and the Tatra is a copy of a kind of sea under sea.
"A total of 75,000 square kilometres can be grown in this area.
The area is a rich place of political coins containing nickel, nickel, cobalt and mangan," says another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, co-worker of the divisio Macedonian, presents another example of a cocrécia.
It reminds me of the pegamen with a potato or a little fantasy with the magic words that make Golem live.
German special forces were present for hostage release.
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis - and the professionals are here.
When the situation became a comet, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
More and more details about the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt will be released.
German special forces have also been involved in the rescue operation, according to the information provided by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
Thus, apart from the German Federal Army experts, GSG 9 was on the flight of the Federal Police Agency and the Federal Criminal Office's staff, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were on the site of release.
According to the information provided by the ministerial spokespersons on Monday evening, German forces did not have to, however, because hostages were allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
"We're lucky we haven't made it" - said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Justice.
The attackers were kidnapped in the southern part of Egypt on 19 September by five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman, and eight groups of Egyptian escorts.
Following a robbery in the South Egyptian desert area, the hostages were dragged here and out into the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The status of hostages remains unclear until then, as well as details of the release of hostages or any ransom payments.
In time, the escaped men arrived at Cairo in a healthy way.
Steinmeier reported that the released hostages were protected by the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
No information has yet been provided about when they return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" website, the five tourists and the special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the German Air Force plane to Airbus.
The U.S. House of Officials rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress had a small majority breach of the $700 billion rescue package proposed for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell into the ground.
The U.S. House of Representatives 227 votes to 206 against yes, the government rejected the rescue package for the financial markets.
Despite calls from the American President George W. Bush and the political leaders of both parties, he did not receive a majority of the programme to stop the chaos on the financial markets.
The supporters desperately tried to convince the critics in a dramatic action that they needed a package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, he called for the representatives to be supported by one of the negotiating leaders of the Democratic Party, even if the plan is still unpopular.
"He admitted that it would be necessary to obtain political support to avoid something that has not yet occurred".
Dow Jones dropped more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Because investors were concerned about the failure of the state rescue package.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote, so that it would fall again after its failure to make public.
Experts account for further severe fluctuations in international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, approval by both the Assembly and the Council is necessary.
Directors register more and more reservations.
Good winter promises to German travel tourists.
According to a study, the traffic of bookings for the following months has increased significantly over the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the poor conjunctural prospects, the Germans' willingness to travel was not a good one.
During the winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded 31 per cent increase in turnover compared to the previous year - presented the German Travel Association (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of bookings for the autumn months is already higher.
In October 2007, the turnover of travel agencies increased by 11 per cent in October 2007, the DRV reported.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1,200 German travel agents, and then extrapolates the entire market.
The Institute took into account the journeys taken into account by the end of August 2008.
In particular, due to the low dollar exchange rate, travels to the USA were reported by the DRV.
Here the volume of bookings increased by about one third.
The Germans are particularly fond of their destination as well as Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic landscapes.
Most of the organized roads were sought - said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to increased energy and food costs, the costs of organised roads "can be calculated as good for passengers as for individual organised travel".
Passengers can save money with advance discounts or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The booking rate for summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to rebook traffic growth again in comparison with the previous year - although another study shows that less German tourists are committed to travelling in the same year.
My first October painting.
Unfortunate celebrities with repeated ballermann scales, litre sculptures and design-like dindds.
Debutting Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not really much alike.
She's a blonde, TV programmer, and she's wearing a scale tailored dind.
My hair is dark, I'm a student, and I bought my clothes in the turquoise.
But one thing is connected: we've been on Wiesnen for almost three minutes, and we've already been runnin' by photographers and filling their memory cards - very flattered, and this is my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
It seems the cheap dindli meets his destination.
As a bus ride north of white sausage, I still have a border for the people as a tourist of Wiesn.
But when we get to Theresienwies, it's not that bad anymore.
Almost everyone wears dindles or leather pants; no one looks around or embarrassed - everything is completely fine.
I mean, it's a strange look at the chocolate banana stage, but I'm not taking a wild look at my fairy tale.
A Munchen woman calls my attention to the misconception of a vow: "You are free in the middle, virgin in the middle, lost to the right, widow in the back."
I secretly passed the art from behind to left.
"It's good," says, and he laughs.
Others are making less effort around fine flirting and they wear a simple filter base "I'm drunk to dress up" with a prescription, and they don't even show their naked butts in the first place.
The young man who shows exhibicioni is called Bob, who also visited Oktoberfest in the first taste.
Which you find very fantastic, long stretched over the "aaaaaaaaa".
He'll tell me after he got rid of the contents of his previous drink.
Right next to one of the fire squads that everyone looks like trash.
So Bob's one of the famous "in sit-in waterers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Eight hours later, the ambulances are going through the scene and taking care of the poor couples.
Patients always show up on a team - four people carry a covered jacket from a tent to a tent.
This works like for most Wiesn visitors: Arrival is empty, departure is blocked.
Who's lying in the alcohol porn under the pole, it doesn't look like it.
"They're the ones who're completely ready" - he's gonna give me one of the Sanités to ask me my question and then in the film band.
The police named the victim of the accident.
The police named that 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
A Brentwood resident on Chelsea Road, Carole Paulson, had an accident on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon in town.
He was transported to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Rome, but later he died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested for suspecting unruly driving after the accident.
He's been released for bail since then.
Turks and Caicos Dollars for the diplomatic horizons of the Turks.
Just before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers have burned its desire to get deeply into the country of Turkey.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, there is one of the greatest relics of the failed religious will.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in a neo-essian style.
At least that's what travel books say.
The building surrounds the end of the Persians, one or two towers at each front corner, and it looks like some German rural town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building's a little full-blown.
However, it is clear from the insidest of the storehouse what a large-scale undertaking this was the western gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, through this Damascus Bagdad, intended to implement its ambitions for the withdrawal of the Middle East by means of the train leading to today's Saudi Arabia.
During World War I, the German sceptical aspirations came together.
The railway lines were attacked by the parties of the Arabian Lawrence and Arab Party.
The relative isolation caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared from the surrounding regions.
The British colonist army withdrew from Egypt and deported the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyperpasha station didn't go any better.
In 1917, an explosive train exploded and destroyed the building's well-designed top.
The Turkish sources say there was a sabotage action.
Since then, it's slowed down, and it's been a bit past history.
At the same time today, like the gate of the Anastasia and the entire eastern region, Turkey is, in a symbolic sense, serving as a diplomatic horizon for Turkey's escalating diplomatic horizons.
The Government's Justice and Development Party - the ACP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared from the surrounding regions.
The new policy is a metal sign of commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States of America.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took up the night train to Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AP, the Turkish Parliamentary Member, Suat Kinikellokt.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours after the failure of the famous documentary on the old world, the rhythm of "The Night Mail", I arrived at the capital of Turkey. The new city is designed to be a symbol of the new world state, which turns its back on the way to the past.
However, it represents an AKP paradox shift with well-known Islamic roots in the Turkish consensus.
That's a little suspicious in the West, especially in Washington.
I went to the AKP House with a cab, an ultra-modern, stone and steel, which is designed for this purpose, which consists of semi-prepared shopping and coffeehouses in a developing suburbs area.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have included a right-to-right policy in any other European country.
She was wearing a night tie, and I'm sure she even had one of Blackberry's.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to help Turkey re-integrate its integration into its immediate environment.
The Cold War blew up the order," he said.
Turkey has isolated itself from its background.
Today he had to turn east and west at once.
You couldn't have chosen one of the two.
He had to go both ways.
"Is it possible that sooner or later, you'll have to make a choice?" I asked.
"The country of Turkey never wanted to make a response."
He then stressed what almost everyone I was talking to here, and I did not say mechanically again: Turkey did not only take advantage of its relations with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea as well as with the United States itself.
It is like trying to convey the message that, in a cross-cutting sense, together with Turkey, all Europe can make it to Asia and the Middle East on those routes to the east.
When I was again at the Hydropasha station, one more night, mostly after the night I was awake, I thought about Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the reconstruction of this magnificent building 100 years ago.
What they would have wondered if they knew that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited in the port for the ferry to return to the Byporus, I realized that at that time Turkey was called "a sick man of Europe" by Turkey.
At least then there was no question which continent would be required for this exciting country.
Rememberable ways of life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley, director of Guildford's music director Vernon (definite, September 11, led the Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus of Guildford.
Based on the music plans for the town, he founded his wonderful youth choir Proteus next year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have been in the choir, but when the Proteus sang in 1979, many of us were at the end of our 20s - we simply refused to take it from the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological transformer) was consistent with the determination and ability of the chorus to cope with any code that they put before you - whether the madded or a part of the Messiah; without accompanied or accompanied by great orchestras.
The diversity of such a young chorus music was often surprising and always exciting, and thanks to the person whose inspiration for our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for yourself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it!"
The conductor's technique was always fully understandable and accurate, but never advocating or overcrowding.
Whatever the musical quality was, he always raised up on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about it:
If he'd ever lived as a guide to be a knight, that was Vernon Handley.
I met him during the two decades he was conducting the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
I've written a criticism about more than 100 concerts over the last forty years, but never, ever disappointed one, and he often gave them up.
Tod Handley and I had the big and modest together, which is very rare.
He hated the drivers who, living with his words, simply "with a couple of well-known battles all over the world."
Many of us will miss it.
Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25th), "He continued his economic history studies in Oxford in 1946, and he became a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman research institute in 1950... while constantly preparing for the acquisition of the basic degree, master's degree and PhD title."
This is from the author's notes of Woodruff's work called "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he graduated from the economic history of Professor J.D. Chambers' division of the British rubber industry, which was then released in 1958 by Professor J.D. Chambers.
In 1950-51, he was actually in the US with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the middle of the summer of 1952 he was at the schools of ilinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois for good.
There's no way to know why Woodruff's beautified his career for this period.
J. Vicente Resino on the cupboard.
I recommend the exhibition "Flamenco and Life" by J. Karente Resino because black and white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
My attention was paid to the simplicity and strength of them and to the people in the photographs.
This exhibition can be passed by emotions.
Resino means saving magical moments."
Second of all, the sales record for Honda is a sales record for Honda.
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation Jazz.
It is true that the front has been quite large enough for passengers, but the design of the new model in internal areas is even more flexible than that.
All this is combined with sophisticated mechanics, which makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Evolution versus evolution.
This is how the second generation Honda Jazz looks.
Although it looks very similar to the example of the new Jazz, he was subjected to numerous internal changes.
These include innovative design, new bodyware, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we switch to a detailed description of the new model, we have to tell you that the new Jazz has appeared six years after the first generation's market has been launched.
So we can begin with the fact that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other producers.
In Europe, Jazz has a less well-known, but in other markets it is making up sales records.
For example, Japan, where in 2002 and later this year, Jazz was the most wanted car brand in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces have been sold out of Jazz since its entry into the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with almost half a million sales examples over six years.
Nevertheless, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In 2007, while the Japanese company sold 83.000 Jazz, the estimates for the sale of 100.000 cars by 2009, which would lead to an increase of 17% in the European market.
On the Spanish market since 2002, Honda has sold 8,000 of Jazz, which represents 6,7% of the total turnover of Honda in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary are calculated with an example sold during a year’s turn 2000.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in the turnover of Honda in Spain.
The company's representatives predict 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which represents a decrease of 4000 below the 2007 figures, i.e. a 16% reduction.
Despite the terms of sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.6% last year to 1.8%.
I would also like to increase this proportion by 2% by 2010.
The Honda hopes that this can be achieved with the introduction of a new model.
This would be the Insight, a hybrid of five-brake and compact size - 4370 mm long - from which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces worldwide each year.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the market share of Insight would be distributed to the United States, while the remaining proportion would be distributed between Old Continis and Japan.
The introduction of the Insight trade after the January official demonstration of competence is due in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz became more extensive in all respects.
It has a length of 3900 mm (with a length of five centimeters), a width of 1690 mm (with a length of two inches) and a length of five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
On the contrary, 1520 mm remain unchanged.
Besides the sizes, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The larger inner space, on the one hand, is the new bodywork and, on the other hand, the fuel tank in the middle, guarantees that this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
Furthermore, the so-called double floor - trunk container has increased in full, currently exceeding the capacity of the first generation with 399 litres, i.e. by 19 litres.
Although this includes those dimensions relating to the type with engine 1.4, since the trunk of 1,2 Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as rear-low lamps or optional panorama glass roof, as well as easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors of the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared with the opening angle of the first jazz 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation Jazz are new too.
At the start of its operation, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, both resource consumption is more favourable than its previous model and is characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine provides excellent performance in all respects.
The power of the 1.2 litres of resource is 90 hours at 6000 speeds and the maximum torque is 114 Nm 4900 speed.
This engine, which in the previous Jazz was 78 horse strengths, consumes 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
And the other engine, which produced 83 lopowers over the previous generation, now reaches 100 lopowers.
Jazz, the 100-valved 1.4, consumes an average of 5.4 litres, and its mission is 128 gram CO2.
The collision "mute auto".
For the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan is this time a new inspiration from nature, quite precisely from the bee world.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents after the bees' hiccups.
The Bio-mmetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C device may be the first step to develop impact prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co. Development Technical Center are the architects of this small robot built in Japan in collaboration with the research and technological research centre of the title University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General for Technology PR and Research Research, BR23C is a further extension of the four-level safety shield cover for Nissan.
The robot will make the company's products more of an impact on the ability to avoid impact.
During the flight, every bees will shape your oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to Nissan's safety shield cover.
However, the role of the complex eye of the uterus is far more important than its role in every direction, which it sees at a angle of more than 300 degrees in every direction. Consequently, the uterus can fly uninterruptedly in its own personal space.
In order to copy the complex function of the eye, engineers designed a so-called laser telemeter (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies obstacles within a range of up to 2 metres in the sight area of BR23C before BR23C, calculated their distance and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that will immediately be transformed into an impact-free operation.
"As soon as the obstacle occurs, the tiny robot, copying the movement of the uterus, will immediately change direction by moving the wheels to a smaller or greater angle to avoid impact.
The system is mostly distinguished from the currently available instruments that, in this case, the avoidor canopy is carried out automatically.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project's chief engineer.
By way of derogation from bees, the avoidor may not be directed upwards or downwards, nor may it move in only two dimensions and only move towards the rotation of wheels, i.e. not infinitely and in the way that happens in the case of bees.
That is why Nissan used a rotation function in the robot, apart from acceleration and slowing, to avoid collisions.
"This structure needs to process and react to data only every few seconds.
There is no need to store data, or to intuitive logic based on previous manicures, so without interruption it can only work with a few dozen KB memorys without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's not really gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte's great memory.
This is the first step to develop technology for the prevention of immediate impact, which, according to Nissan estimates, can be incorporated in serially manufactured cars within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer accumulators that are easier and more durable than lithium-ion.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be an opportunity to get the car from the car to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear from the mortgage is fear of fear.
We have to admit that beyond the fact that he has a lot of investments in cash, he has no sense at all.
Because of the crisis and the fact that Americans do not questionable mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "Rose Loans Hotel"... or the Gallicans.
The accommodation and, in particular, the embroidery of the receptionor suggest that we think about it again, twice, and more than three times, whether it really is just the time of the borrowing.
And especially where to apply for credit, because that is probably the purpose of this thing.
The information available on the website is indeed useful, but rather detailed.
It's more of a mess than it's for the general public.
But what would happen if we added to the game?
For example, a room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, it's something, 'cause we don't even know how to dream about buying housing...
Morgan Stanley will open its capital for MUFG.
Morgan Stanley has announced that it will provide a share in its capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the capital of the company after the Morgan Stanley share exchange rate fell much on the stock exchange.
One week after the preliminary agreement was published, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9,9 % of Morgan Stanley’s shares at a price of $25 million, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The price accepted remains below 19% of the book value of securities on 31 August.
MUFIG invests another $6 billion in the purchase of swapable securities, providing a 10% return and a conversion rate of $31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, when the global transaction is executed, an average price of 29 dollars is based on an average price of 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock exchange rate fell from 17 o’clock to 6.79%, with it closing at 23.07 p.m.
"This strategic alliance is a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to speed up the transformation of a banking holding company" - explains John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status by which he may diversify his activities last week, but will be subject to the supervision of Federal Reserve.
The MUFG agreement reiterates the fact that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the corporate values indicated on Wall Street.
On the basis of the conditions notified on Monday, the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan only reported that 20% of its shares were sold to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"We thought a week ago that the share would be entirely limited" - explained Mizuno Toshihid, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"But because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect potential risks."
In terms of the weighted average price, MUFIG pays more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares by 7%.
As a result of the transaction, the yield per share is reduced by around 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert half of its senior shares into shares after one year if the trade rate of the latter over a specified period exceeds more than 50% of the conversion rate, i.e. it rises to around 47 USD.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can use its funds to make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity resources.
However, the spokesperson of the group did not wish to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's association, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its solvency rate according to Tier I, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that his balance sheet was definitely improved since the end of August.
Over the last few weeks, a great deal of effort has been reported to the group since the stock exchange rate fell half to half, while the cost of ensuring the non-payment risk has escaped into the heavens.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One of the biggest banks was the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and after the acquisition of Merlll Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that he had reached $15 billion: part of this came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa Monday's statement, Quito.
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This joint plan is for Venezuela's Hugo Chávez, the Evo Morales of Bolivia, and the Rafael Correa of Spain.
On Sunday, following the pattern of his presidents and friends, Correa explained her ideas about the new creation.
His mission was successful since 64% of the voters voted yes in the referendum according to official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
As a result, 28% of the population voted with no votes, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were unfilled by the voters.
The adoption of the draft Constitution required a majority of 50% + 1 votes.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the voting offices and an accounting carried out by a non-governmental organisation have shown a huge proportion of 'yes' votes with 63% and 70% respectively.
After all, Rafael Correa spoke about the victory of the draft Constitution on Monday from Monday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won a huge victory" - declared it, and he thanked the U.S.U.U.U.A. about 280 miles south of Quito to the southwest of Guayaquil, the governor's seat.
As well as known, Mr Correa, Mr Chávez, Mr Morales, and President Chile, Mr Michelle Bachelet, also congratulated the President of Chile.
According to the report of the United States Organisation (OAS) observer mission, the vote was held in a calm atmosphere. It was the main theme of a 444 precise text which incorporated the principles of 'new socialism', which was protected by the President.
The proposed constitution claims that the government will serve the economy, while maintaining the right to the state to 'design a development' to a country that is essentially from the extraction of oil from foreign companies and from the foreign currency sent by foreign companies.
The draft Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, also confirms the Head of State's power to acquire a mandate for a maximum period of two consecutive periods and is entitled to cancel the assembly.
Correa has already announced that he wants to live with this opportunity, and in February 2009 he will again compete for the Prime Minister's mandate.
The Constitution also included the freedom of health services and education, and the President has already begun to introduce it in a country of 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population live under the minimum of living.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could end with the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of a U.S.U.U.A. facility providing a basis for American anti-drug measures.
They released 19 hostages in Chad.
He was attacked by a Egyptian captain on the kidnappers, who had taken hostages of eleven tourists and eight escorts of them ten days ago.
The hostages are currently staying in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed on Monday afternoon to the capital of Egypt.
The hostages were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad during the morning.
Apparently, they arrived at the al-Maza military base, which is directly connected to the Cairo International Airport, about half a afternoon.
The hostages were banned from making a statement to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in the suburbs of Cairo, Mexico, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthful", and the kidnappers say "not paid a ransom" at the airport, Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna, Egypt.
On 19 September the hostages were captured at the foot of the mountain Ouanat in the border region of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in a humid safarin. The group was then dragged from one of the 35 unknown hostages to another.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, one border guard and the director of the Agyptonian travel agency.
According to information from an Egyptian Security Officer, a special command force of 30 members arrived on two helicopters to the site where they hit the hostages right before the current.
There was a fire between the troops. Half the kidnappers were killed, the others were escaped," said the leader who asked for his name to be shut down.
He also stated that a total of 150 special team members were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where they added German and Italian communes.
The Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We have to recognise that this result would not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our civil service personnel and groups of our activities," he announced, without any further details.
He also denied that the hostages would pay a ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during the patrol, a roadway was arrested on which the kidnappers were traveling. Six of them were killed (including the leader of the King), two were arrested.
According to the military, hostages were connected with a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organization concerned immediately called upon.
Lettres - Culture is the quiet majority of culture.
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of the journalists and the election campaign currently taking place.
We can only be happy.
But they continue to forget about a piece of our cultural life.
He will raise his word in order to explain the ridiculous amounts of money that he will receive from the small museums, archives, historical digs and national historical monuments on the edge of hunger?
Which politician reminds the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings as part of cultural heritage?
Or that neither Quebec nor Canada does there exist laws that truly guarantee effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government only spent three and a half million euros in the restoration of Chinon Castle in Loire Valley?
And the Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated way by all citizens, all elected representatives and all governmental bodies.
Within the framework of the Association of History Societys in Quebec (Fédération des socialétés d'histore du Quebec), 211 members of the organization of history, cultural heritage, archives and genetics are working on research into history and on the conservation of large numbers of private archives and archaeological findings with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our tooth-circle heritage and protest against the last force of the filth when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their buldozers to our old buildings and lost funerals.
When will anyone ever stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
State the Fortis Bank is part of the Benelux regime.
The Benelux countries are helping themselves with their share of publicisation due to the ring-fence of the US credit market crisis - as the first European - on the Belgian bank in Fortis - with a total of EUR 11.2 billion in support of a financial and insurance institution with Hungarian stakeholders.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level in the case at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, Fortis’s bank is the first major crisis in the context of the international financial market crisis that has been surrounding the waves for more than one year, and decisions in the case of the bank can therefore be considered to have a certain degree of precision.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, almost half of all three states (49 %) acquire their existing assets there.
The bank will certainly sell part of its interests, including, above all, the activities of insurance, which was purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year, mainly from the Netherlands.
Fortis' shares started falling steeply last week, during the second half of the week there were serious crises at the Institute.
However, they agree that with 85 thousand employees, the bank is too big to let it go bankrupt.
The company's papers fell only on Friday by about 12 percent, to 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers, this is not realistic.
By the way, the company accused the overseas market uncertainty about the adoption of the $700 billion US package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers went up slightly.
On Friday, Philip Dierckx has appointed a new CEO at the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private buyers, but no one has checked in with a worthy offer.
The Belgian Government has already indicated earlier that investors do not have to worry or lose their money.
There has been no panic among bank clients so far, the drawers have not been seizured.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own branch and has purchased leasing companies as well.
Fun in the henhouse.
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude insurance contracts with the applicant on the basis of human drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become unaudited.
"There is a data protection programme binding in all cases on the consent of the person concerned to use the pharmacovigilance data.
It must be independent, otherwise we trust the fox with the hen-hot" - quote Richard Dick, the developer of a program capable of following prescriptions in Washington Post.
Insurance undertakings shall depend on the health status of the customer in question on the insurance premium and the amount to be incurred in the event of damage, and, if they consider the risk too high, they shall not be covered by insurance.
A long time ago, the person was sent for medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick found a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: using the customer's identification number, he easily buys what kind of medicines he bought over the past year and from which the program itself will be the result of the disease and health status of the client.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat level is virtually untreated, which is listed in a higher risk category right away.
There are several versions of the programme, some of which also define a risk factor, so the insurer has little to do with paper work, although minor difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some medicines can be used for several purposes, such as certain compounds can also be used against migraine or heat waves, but may also be effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-growth factor for business insurers, and they are not.
Special companies have been established to request and process the data, and they are asked for the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacy.
They are now obliged by the authorities to do so, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Some companies are already working on the results of laboratory studies and are connected to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data and control of use in parallel will become more difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it only covers healthcare providers and insurance undertakings.
Before the convention, there is a bill of law that gives the authorities control over companies that specialize in reporting.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough: it has therefore developed its programme, which would lead to its explicit contribution to the transmission of data.
Another question is that the person concerned may not refuse the contribution, otherwise insurance undertakings do not conclude contracts with him.
Thus, all hens are referring to the welfare of the fox.
Global Marsede menu menu menu menu menu menu menu menu.
It doubles trade between the European Union and India.
As the European Union and India's mutual-led trade partners, the 9th Summit was also under the direction of this issue, along with other global problems, mainly global.
Today there will be a French-India summit, where we are talking about nuclear energy cooperation in particular.
The European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic power that should be given greater attention to international matters, but the Member States have not yet succeeded in reaching a common denominator, in supporting the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not therefore broken down at yesterday's 9th summit in Marseille, which was held yesterday.
President Sarkozy, French President of Nicolas Sarkozy, and President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso and High Representative of the Commission for Foreign Affairs, Javier Solana, hosted the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who also agreed to double in five years, i.e. to increase trade turnover to hundreds of billions of euros.
Given that the trade increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an ambitious target.
In this regard, in a legal sense, the twenty-six bilateral civil air agreements with India, i.e. air traffic, could travel in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised they'd speed up the conciliation.
The aim is to balance that, while the EU's first India's first trade partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place in the EU's partners.
The summit has given its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism have been condemned in all forms on both sides of the latter and called for the UN Conference to be convened.
The Doha Trade Round has also been called for to end, although they both have a large part of their failure so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will maintain its energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce harmful emissions by at least 20 % by 2020.
India also agreed, just as it did, that a global agreement should be reached at the forthcoming climate conference and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 per cent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and to call for an international conference to be held to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the capital of France today, where at the bilateral meeting a trade is about to take place on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they trust that the French companies will be ordered to build nuclear reactors in India in EUR 20 billion.
According to agency reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than three hundred Italian book publishers in Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Hungary.
Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmese fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for 7,000 exhibits from 101 countries, in 171.790 square meters basic area where more than 403.000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Government, Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture and Activities, represented by Italy, through the establishment of a single Italy Point, will take 26 square meters of exhibition area.
The solemn opening will be followed by a press conference to be held in the House of Buchmesse 5.0 "Rom Struktur", where data, trends and prospects will also be presented on the situation of Italian book publishing.
According to data, the Italian output market is constantly decreasing the proportion of foreign authors, particularly in adult and youth publications.
A year ago, they found the plane of a billion billion billion billionaire, Steve Fossett's plane by Steve Fossett.
They found the remains of the billions of Steve Fossett's plane, which disappeared on September 3rd, 2007 over the desert in Nevada.
The wrecks were found in a 3,000-metre high upland in the vicinity of Mammoth Lakes, located at the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains were found inside the aircraft.
Mr. Johnson, Sheriff of Madera County, all the existing doubts were disbanded: "We sent out a team after determining the location of the flight, and now we can be sure that it was about the plane on the day Steve Fossett flew missing" - said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in either the plane or the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Aviation Safety Agency (NTSB) reported that a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, an investigation committee was requested to identify the machine and to find out that it was actually about Bellaca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fosset started a three-hour flight from Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday, too, in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some personal things Fossett's near Mammoth Lakes' home.
Two IDs for Fosset, issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Inspectorate, some cash and a sweater.
The search for a sample was submitted a month after the disappearance of a sample.
The billion have set up a number of peaks to sign themselves in history.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he was able to start flying around the earth with an air bubble: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he was caught flying a plane around the ground without landing.
Many of his records include the flight above Andok, at an altitude of 15.445 meters, which he performed with a second-pilot pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
A unusual, yet original and fixed-world hobby jet with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest "competrator of Mercedes-Benz" that the German automotive factory tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
This is precisely why the introduction of SUV GLK at Mercedes-Benz shows will be surprising and unusual due to its traditional content from 17 October to 17 October.
For the advertising campaign accompanying the presentation of the new vehicle is currently using an unknown media-communication device, including by means of utopy 3D posters that have not been used in Italy by car brands in Italy.
The giant plakat action, consisting of three stages, will dominate Milan 's central shopping street until 15 November, Corso Como .
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the car's spatial performance presentation, whereby the new SUV, shared by special glasses around Corso Como, will be visible almost in real terms and in three-dimensional forms.
The photographer will feel like the car is coming out of the poster.
After that, through the innovative Lifemina8 technology, it becomes visible each detail of the new GLK, in order to form a uniform form.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new with this promotion into the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry.
Is it possible to raise the interest of future customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably being excluded from orbits.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of Italy? The members of the group called "Ultras Italia", which has been following the selection for years, and which, in fact, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They never bumped into your opponent's fans.
The core of the group is the right side of the group.
The chief organisers are coming from Trivento.
Also from Verona, Padua, Triest and Udin.
These have been joined in Sofia by smaller dispersal groups from Campania and Puglia (i.e. only a few units in fact).
Italian flags were swept down, on which the home city of the fans was marked: on Saturday they were removed so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a true Nazi starboard team with the Levski drivers.
The Italian football association has made 144 tickets available to Italian fans, and these were tickets for their name, so it is easier to check the cheer team.
The Ministry of Home Affairs has checked everyone out: there was no one in progress who would have been banned from the stadium visit between the People who were preparing for Sofia.
Four Italian fans who have a record related to football have refused the ticket and the trip.
The Ministry of Interior is currently waiting for protocols from the Sofia Police and will then take the necessary measures: those fans who have been arrested or identified during the disturbances may also be subject to five years of ban.
This is an international ban which applies not only to the visit of all European stadiums, but also to all the Italian and European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't put their feet in any football field.
Lucky for you.
But we also have to fear that the Huligans will be found followers, i.e. that they have only one hundred and fifty, others will join.
"You have to put this fire away, you must not excuse the person who behaves like this", the Ministry of the Interior informed me.
So it is better to keep an eye on our eyes, especially since it is close to the Wednesday selected match day in Lecca.
In Puglia, there is a smaller cell that supports Italian ultura.
The Monitoring Service will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday, the Safety of Sports Events Committee, which may also be expected to be part of one of the Departments of Home Security, will meet on the subject of security services in the area of cheer behaviour.
"Duce-Duce scanning and flying arm under the Italian hymn? In Bulgaria there's no crime..."
He developed this idea in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago at the front of the Ministry of the Interior's observation service (post Francesco Tagliente and formerly Felice Ferlizzi took part in).
Before that, Mazzilli was the chief general of the town where a cell in Ultras Italy has been operating since 2002 in support of the Ultras group.
What Mazzilli claims to be true in Bulgaria is not allowed to feed Duca, but the behavior of that 150-200 sponsor was a disgrace.
I'm not a socioologist, he's put the first man in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime was committed.
Until now, this group has not caused any trouble. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to continue.
But let's also talk a little about the sweat of the Italian hymnous: it's not a crime, but if I say so, it's not a good thing to call it..."
