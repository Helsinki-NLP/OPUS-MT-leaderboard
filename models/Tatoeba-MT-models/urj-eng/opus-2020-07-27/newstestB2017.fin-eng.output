A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a Sanfranciscola shopping mall.
Only a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping center stairs this week.
The victim's brother says that he didn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally received his order."
The body found from the Westfield shopping center Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old sanfranciscoline as Frank Galicia, reported to be the San Francisco Agency for Legal Medicine.
San Francisco police say death is being investigated as a spirit crime.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the television company to the ABC KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, formerly worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job when he got to the chef of the San Francisco Sons & Daughts Restaurant six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Daughts restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're a small and close team, like a family.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells me that Frank had lived in a hostel first, but he had finally got his job done.
"He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend," said Louis Galicia to the KGO station.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
"He was kind and big-hearted.
His way of being together with the family was to cook food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who went along with the current.
Despite all the flaws that occur in the world, he was a huge diamond who had perpetrated every day," he says.
All people who know about this case are invited to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-075-444.
Other work counter counteringing train physicians are calling for new measures to combat work.
Representatives of British junior doctors (who are mostly physicians in Finland) have called on their trade union and asked for permission to take new work fighting measures in the context of a new labour agreement.
The Committee on Junioris (JDC) of the British Trade Union for Doctors (BMA) is requesting support from its entire Government for further work as from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Doctors and students of medicine rejected the agreement with BMA at the July vote.
Of the members who took part in the vote, 58% of the members who voted rejected the agreement.
Mr Ellen McCourt, president of the Committee on Veterinary Affairs, published a letter on Thursday night on Twitter to the members of the JDC, where he says that the government "sufficiently fell" on the issues that McCourt said led to the rejection of the agreement.
The letter says: "In this light, the JDC Government has completely rejected the new draft agreement in its vote and calls for all our concerns to be subject to new formal negotiations.
In response to the government’s difficulties, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request to the Government of BMA, in which it requests authorisation for a limited progressive expansion of labour struggles from the beginning of September."
As a result of the dispute, the junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, which included the first complete malfunctions ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Johann Malawa, director of BMA's junior doctor, resigned from his post after the vote because he did not accept the negotiated terms that BMA had recommended.
Malawa said to BMA members at pre-vote meetings that the agreement was good and should be accepted. 54 000 junior doctors and medical students took part in the vote.
After voting, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would enter into force and that it would apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an international association?
It was the gesture that resolved the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday in order to reach an agreement and to conclude an official decision on the word war and economic sanctions of eight months.
However, while taking Vladimir Putin against his Turkish counterpart in the golden hall of Peter’s palace, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was Ankara.
The parties, however, did so,
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't even cut off the heat at his own humble standard.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" about Mr Putin – according to a report five times.
I didn't stay in the bills myself.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan's behaviour as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I felt exactly the opposite of his zeal.
However, the continuous delay from Putin showed that the Prime Minister of Russia has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction to the event period was a mess.
Putin attacked strictly, I said against Ankara and accused him of stabing his back.
It was even greater than that because it became a supposed friend of mine.
Getting true trust back will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the most controlled information media from the state went on a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden, it was just that the Turkishs were the reason for everything.
The most serious was the charges of top officials, according to which Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal trade in oil in the areas dominated by Isisi in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the accusations.
However, the official message from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
At the end of the day, this meeting was only arranged to give Putin an apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have won some kind of victory.
The benefits of the declaration of an adversary are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power in a failed coup in the last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey.
There is also economic impact on the agreement.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey hard, in particular the charter ban, as it is normal for thousands of Russian tourists to travel to Turkey's coast each year.
The volume has fallen by nearly 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be concerned about the relief when air transport can ultimately be continued.
They put their faith in the late season to rush into the Mediterranean Sea.
And still this week, state television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will drop when imports of agricultural products from Turkey are allowed again.
"Chairmen there, tomatoes back here", was formulated in the Vedemost article.
However, the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it feels that the West reacts to the coup d'état.
It is a Putin who is eager to take advantage of the cool between the cool spaces and to undermine Turkey's ties with the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected elected authorities after the co-decision.
This was obvious to Moscow, who has his own feelings about how to take advantage of the revolution.
Therefore, Russia and Turkey, at their peak meeting in the context of the French maritime conventions, could convey a picture of what one analyst described as a "outermost union": two countries that experience being rejected by the West and treated with a great deal of treatment, combine their strengths.
Despite the public reconciliation, these two still have large differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides of Russia and Turkey.
Tell me much that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told me at the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all at all.
The President of Turkey has been determined not to answer the question of differences between countries, while Putin has stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could reach agreement in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a complete disaster caused by the NATO Member State Turkey when shooting down a Russian combat aircraft, it is undoubtedly better that after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State will once again be in talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland outside Scotland.
According to the Director-General of the RBS Bank, the Bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced so that in the future it will only provide business services such as back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally associated with the bank’s global objectives.
The bank had to retreat from its objectives when it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
During that time brand-trategist has used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors millions of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to enter more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be left to the use of Scottish customers, but it will not be used as a discount for RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are changed to NatWeste, with the exception of head office and stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed in Inverness-shir during the presentation to customers and staff.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and because of what our staff is working for, because we are now turning into a much more different bank of brands.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Today, our aspirations are no longer global but local.
Each of these brands represents something very different within its own community, and our staff works with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of different brands in sport sponsorship.
"Now it is time to turn into a bank containing different brands, as basically it is about how we can make a bank better for customers," says the Governor of the Bank.
"It would have been very exciting three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and made brands available.
But the work and concentration of our customers' needs instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettor was riding a Predilection to win in New Store, and he won 3 000.
The dettor showers champagne twice after winning in Newmarket, which cost him 3 000.
Jockie Frankie Dettor verified his 3000 winnings in the UK Championship on Friday, Newmarket.
By riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night on the track of his own municipality. The presentation is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettor, 45, is the sixth jockey, which achieves this milestone in fair competitions running along a steady track.
Previously on Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edgery and Willie Carson.
A three-time champion of Dettor, who previously won in Ghayyari, says: "This is special.
My feelings are high because my family is also here.
I'm really glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely ordinary Friday night and a 20 000-life audience.
I'm relieved and I feel great humility."
The dettor will accept the cheerings of the Predilection with the Predilection after his victory after his victory. After his victory, the dettor will win after his victory.
Two jockeys have arrived at the virtuous obstacle competitions, and they are champions Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4 300 times in his record-based career.
Lester Piggott, nine-fold Derby winner, 4 493 winnings.
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that just now he has reached this milestone that few have reached.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactical advantage is what distinguishes him from the others.
He is a fantastic representative of the race race race, his enthusiasm and his exorcism have brought the species supporters for years."
"I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that she would have won 6 000 pounds if she hadn't only competed on weekends and only in big races.
Speaking seriously, Frankie's horseback at the British Competitions has been a victory almost 30 years, which has been a great watch.
He is a living person, which is good for British competition competition, but above all he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor's performance is seemingly marked by jumping off his horse's back by misbeaning off his horse.
"The following goals have been made by Frankie Dettor, who has been a model for British competition competition competition for two decades.
We've got some upper and lower legs on the road.
He has won numerous big races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but he has also survived flight accident and has been in a competitive ban because of drug abuse.
When the race ban ended three years ago, he had problems of starting up, but he showed an admiring nature of strength, seemed to his suspects and returned to the best.
And he's not yet going to stop his career for a while – the dettor has recently said that he wants to continue his race until at least 50 years old."
Put was separated by Managing Director Sergei Ivanovin, Head of Administration of Sergei Ivanov.
The President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin suddenly fired Sergei Ivanov, his managing director.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's credible interior for many years.
Ivanov, 63, has now been appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport field.
According to the Kremlin press, President Putin 's decision to release Ivanov's duties as Head of the Russian President' was not to state the reasons for its resignation.
Anton Vato, acting as Deputy Director of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed as the task.
Mario, 44, is a former diplomat.
Päto, born in Tallinn in 1972, was graduated from a respected Moscow Institute of State International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president’s section of the minutes and the government’s office, explains Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
Peter thanked Putin for his appointment with the following words: "I am grateful for your confidence in the future.
In my opinion, the main task of administration is to support your activities as Head of State, which means carrying out and controlling the legal nature of the law, how your instructions are implemented."
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov had himself asked for a divorce and recommended that she be his successor.
Are you smiling at real people?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been close to Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he has a KGB past.
As Head of Administration he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the Russian state television show said that Ivanov would withdraw from his mission at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown on the cameras, the explanations assure only a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
You've been fired for some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious about the formal claim that a man who is a potential president wants suddenly to lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give me this very complex and to some extent even difficult task for four years.
I have now been head of the President's Administration for four years and eight months."
Ivanov took the job in December 2011.
Until then, he was the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, is a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, King Putin acted as Head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed his Deputy Head of Staff.
When Putin entered into power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
It was always thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after the second period, since the Constitution would have prevented Putin from selecting for the third term.
However, the mission went to another of Putin's neighbors, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became prime minister, and then he returned to President only three and a half years later.
The star of Criminal Minds – FBI researchers - Thomas Gibson was fired after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce a series of series, said they were fired in their joint communication.
As Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as the series, Gibson had submitted an apology on Thursday before his resignation was informed.
"We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened here," he says in his notifications.
Information on how Gibson's character will be written out of the next series of FBI agents, published later, will be published in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
In the past comedy series, Dharma & Greg played 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series from its first production period, i.e. since 2005, since 2005.
"I love Crimial Minds, and I've put my heart and soul on it for the last twelve years," says Gibson in his newsletter published on Friday.
"I promised I'd see the end of the show, but that's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all the authors, producers, actors, our great production group and most importantly: the best fans that the series could have ever hoped for."
The 12th series of production began in the United States on September 28th.
The mysterious beaching of fish into the Banffla garden is a mysterious beach to the Banffle garden.
Kevin Bai, who lives in Banff, has asked for help to identify the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain has doubts that these 75 fish are windsurfings that have come to land as an eye for a whirlpool.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published a vision of the footage in Periscope and hoped to get an answer to the appearance of these five-foot fish.
The transfer from Queensferry to Queensferry has now been linked to the Fifeen.
The EUR 1,35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have joined Queensferry through the north coast and the mainland, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Fifee.
It is the first of the four sections between the "cuffles", which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
The size of the bridge Fifesta is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10 000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 barrels of steel.
The EUR 1,35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister of Finance, Keith Brown, visited the country of work today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is an historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Overseas Bridge.
We are all witnessing a truly significant step forward in the construction of the bridge. More than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge alone.
Despite massive size and weight, building the bridge between the land bridge and the bridge is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The whole bridge is now in place almost 79%, and the rest of the deck is getting its concrete pain in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to rise in place."
Michael Martin, Head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always an important urinary gain in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
After the last part of the road had been installed and attached to the road map of the North Tower, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. above) track.
This was done by pulling the north-west of the countryside 700 millimetres south of the country.
This was a massive and at the same time an operation requiring great accuracy.
Massive, because it has a length of 222 metres and a weight of about 6 000 tonnes and was to be pulled up at a angle of approximately 3%.
And the huge accuracy required, because the tolerances that the working team had to follow were very small – only a few millimetres.
Fortunately, everything went well."
Moelfre Bay rescue plant tells about three men’s three man’s miracle defeat.
Anglesey, out of his fishing boat, three men in charge of water were saved like a miracle store.
The Mielfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station made a alarm on Friday at 13.20 a local time for its crew to detect an accident at Moelfre Bay's bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to safety while their boat continued their reckless course without a director.
"We saw a boat going around right next to them, and we imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who was driving the Moelfren rescue boat.
"By the time we got into the water, the strong winds had, fortunately, transported the boat away from them."
The local fishing boat saved two men, while the third of them were 60 years old, was found exhausted in the wake of a boy's curd and without a lifeline.
They were all taken on board to a cruise ship and transported to a rescue station.
Vince Jones says, "It is a miracle that these three men who have been caught in water are still alive and perfectly well.
There was an emergency exit tape on the boat’s engine, but for some reason it had been disengaged in the event of a crash from a man of time.
They had a very happy trip."
Posémon Go yacht brings health and happiness.
It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.
In the last decade, many have complained why teenagers and children are not going out to play anymore, but rather stay inside and stare at their squares.
Pokeon Go makes people get off the couch and move.
Originally, they only took a television watch, and then there were video games and the latest smartphones.
So it's amazing to note that technology and the foreign community do not exclude each other.
This, of course, is the reference to Pomémon Go. Pomémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (which later was also made in a cartoon series, playing cards and other related products).
Like many popular cultural events, this also ended a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Lanseerus was delayed in other countries due to a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the user number of the Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was almost as large as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In short, the players will go out looking for pokers that are being monitored using GPS. When you find the poker, it can be "photo" (with the phone display) or "Capulate" when you find it.
The wildness has hit with a video game as a younger game in a generation of games and raised the rear sides of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "average person" will take a day.
The Washington Post recently told me about the Apple Watch Cardigram app that found within two days of the game's launch that 30 minutes of daily moving volumes suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. The Cardigram follows 35,000 users.
The company does not know who of the users is playing the Pokémon Go game, it sees only the raw data of the sports.
A number of public health campaigns encouraging people to get off the couch and move at least 30 minutes a day have been turned into deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of sport should not be reduced.
Regularly mobile probability of cancer or depression is lower.
The exercise helps with weight control, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings large amounts of other benefits.
The great thing about the Pokeon Go game is that it makes people go out and do something that they enjoy.
This will achieve three basic health-supporting issues — exercise, fresh air and sun and joy.
It is possible to even make new friends during the hunt.
Like usual, this phenomenon includes aggravating pleasures.
And yes, when someone's playing, someone can walk toward the door.
What about it?
There's been a breakthrough.
For even though Fitbit's phone applications may have been able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not allow you to move, as Poémon Go does.
There will be a loss of new comfort, and the use will decrease in time.
However, the success of pokonys will result in more games combining applications and virtual reality with activeness in the real world, which will increase the activity of people leaving the hunt and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's tennis game.
Pressure pressure.
Forget jumping.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamine jump.
It's a non-interruption.
The jaws shake on the butterfly.
Great for everything.
And now also the Olympic winner.
An American 19-year-old TV winner won the championship of the multi-game on Thursday and grew a difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics' photo shoot.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than the "Final Five" teammate, Aly Raisman, and Russia's pronsist, Aliya Mustafin.
The United States Simone Biles is taking place in the booming of women's individual competition finals on Thursday, Rio's 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and fifth American ever and won the championship of the diversity, which he thus strengthened his reputation for the best of his generation or even for the best of all time.
The party burst into tears when his final integer came to light and his long way to this moment ended.
The yield will bring the species into completely new dimensions and raise it in the same category with other superstars, such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely overwhelming for the past three years. He has won 15 World Championships, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such ambitious and precise programmes that 1984's Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said he was "the greatest television player of all time."
In Brazil, there was still one last competition between Biles and himself and the burden created by excessive expectations, not at all between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring less than a handful of gold medals would be tested as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman are hugs after winning gold and silver women's tennis competition in an individual competition for the single competition of single competition for the television performance of the women on Thursday in Rio's 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.12016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on i, a co-ordinated national team and now a retired Martha Karoly's going to retire.
Although Biles claimed that never thought of anything earlier when he was at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
A part of his permanto program — which includes his master card with a well-known volt show — has been adapted to Latin music, which may well be heard on the streets outside the Olympic Arena of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
Boorman found a girl when she was on a day-to-day trip to the gym where Boorman was coached.
He has not lost any multicompetition competition after summer 2013, and the profit line is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Blackfina got a little lead on two rounds, it was like a fabric.
The remaining were boom and permanto, where Biles is a defense world champion.
He got back to the lead after he got 15.433 points from the shop, and then he threw the result back at 15.933 points from his performance.
Raisman was mildly hugging him when they waited for final points — which was just a formality — and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white, and blue-painting drawing color, when his dream of writing his copybook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small renaissance for a four-year-old competition, when he first divided the third place but then lost the denss to Blackfin in the rerun round.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team "mute" was clearly ahead of Blackfina.
He sent airlocks to the audience after his permanto program and thus became the winner of a loss position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as the party is concerned, this 19-year-old, week-old, and widespread swinging is now entirely new:
The police tell three music music in the car about three music being the victim of a serial serial killer who has been the victim of a serial killer who has been the serial killer who has been the serial serial killer who has been the victim of a serial killer, who has been the victim of a serial killer who has been played by the serial killer
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating mass murder in Phoenix for ten years, and the victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, telling the police notice published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on June 12, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Eles' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the streetside on 12 June.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the page where he shot eight shots with his hand gun and then fled on the other car, the information says.
The police suspect that the third death was not a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags and the second adult victim's hearing found $2,900.
Officer Phoenix P.D., Sergeant Jonathan Howard says the police are now investigating whether death is related to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two were wounded in nine attacks that have taken place mainly in Latin American settlement areas within four months.
"It is common for events that they have happened in residential homes from home", Howard told CBS's subsidiary KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the white Cadillac or Lincoln in the late 1990s.
The investigators do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that their cause is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where he later died due to his injuries.
Lier, 31, and Eles's daughter, Maleah, died immediately at the scene of the event.
The witness told the police that the triangle had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a notice stating that only half an hour before the third death of an empty open van was fired. The shooter is believed to be the same in either case.
The investigators found the shells and took a bullet from the seat of the car and a bullet in the engine compartment.
The mother of a six-year-old kid with microcephaly: "The things are getting better".
Like most people aged 6 years, including Edmund Piccituu likes singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
However, unlike most other age mates, Edmund has a microcephalia, the birthal small brain, which is due to the genetic disorder of her mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, which she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I wouldn't make it.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it," he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and maybe not survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child be placed in institutional care.
"My initial reaction was that I didn't think there was any more of that practice," says Picciuu.
Edmund walks with the driver.
Edmund rose up and began to contaminate when he was three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving forward with his own will.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
He likes to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth presents the idea of Edmund, which means "a song to me".
"We teach him sign language," Picciuuu told CBS News.
However, it does not just mean the ordinary sign language, but it also includes Edmund's own inventions of figs.
The background of microcephaly may be a variety of diseases: hereditary, such as Edmund, or post-natal viral infections, such as runny or zicavirus.
There are large variations in symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people who are ill with zicavirus.
Piccito remembers the emotional storm caused by an uncertain future.
"I kept doing: "What happens to us,
what happens to us."
He still doesn't know.
"I haven't been asking you for a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it to me."
But Picciou has hopeful advice for mothers whose children have birth defects caused by zicavirus.
"The things are getting better.
Things are usually going to be all right.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
The seals and floods have caused massive rescue operations in the States of Louisiana and Mississippi, in the States of Louisiana and Mississippi.
On Friday, the governor of Louisiana declared an emergency due to heavy rainfalls and widespread floods. More rains on the state are expected on Saturday.
According to the national weather service, several rivers of south-eastern Louiisina and South Missipi flood over their haystacks and spread to a wide range as a result of the strong loads.
Louisian governor John Bel Edwards tells us that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, editor of the National Security and Emergency Response Agency, reports that the Agency receives requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand traps.
According to Steele, only Tangipahah Province has requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood warning will remain valid until Saturday in most parts of South Louisana.
According to the weather notice provided by the weather service, water may still be in the area 76–127 mm more.
In South Alaska, flood warning was given on Friday when rains continued in the Mobile Region.
During the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, each of which in Louisiana, is forecast to rise to the rising record heights.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the banks of the rivers may be flooded under the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that floods in Ascension region pose a threat, as flooding rivers slowly disappear into Lake Maurepas Lake.
On Friday, at 9 a.m., the Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state of Mississippi, was raised already higher than ever on Friday.
The rescue work continued in the region of Amiten and Wilkinson in the south-west-Missiz region.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepdaughter were earlier on Friday near Gloster among the saved ones.
Hansford, 62, tells us that the Beaver Creek River, which normally is over 120 metres from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
He had been warned by the second half of the nearby area.
"We got up, and the water came on a continuous feed." Hansford says.
"It extends beyond my belt."
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she lived in the region.
Hansford tells us that he himself and his family have injuries on his own and that he himself is the only one who can swim from them.
The rescue workers had saved all three major military-style trucks and had them taken to a fire station in Gloster, where they kept shelter on Friday.
The weather forecaster Krautmann says that floods are rapidly spreading over time, as the loads continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells us about the information received from an observer close to Livingston that it had rained almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil was soaked strongly after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities report that, due to the flooding of rough roads and streets, the inhabitants of Tangipahho County were forced to save their homes, and they had to cancel their school hours in five schools.
A member of the City Council of Tangipa had told the CBS’s subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has been over them both.
Robby Miller, head of the region, tells us that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets who had been imprisoned by the flood.
Evacuated shelters have been opened in cities of Amiten and Hammond.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to retreat," he says.
In the city of Hammond, nearly twenty streets were closed for floods, and the inhabitants were offered sand crayons to try to prevent water from entering their homes and premises.
"The last time we met a great flood in March", says Lacy Landrum, Member of the city government.
"This flood seems to be similar."
In Mississippi, the rains continued flat on the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, reports Rupert Lacy, the rescue manager of Harrison County.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday, a house under a heavy flood was reported, but on Friday there has been no information available so far.
Keith Townson, head of the opera Valád Foods Store, reports that he has lived in the Amiten region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time."
Several bullets from the 6-year-old Mahaha Brown, who received several bullets from his body, survives from the Philadelphia shooting incident in Philadelphia.
According to the police, there's a 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia who's already been shot in the city by another six-year-old who's been shot this week.
Parents told me about the son on the CBS Philadelphia channel that Maháj Brown was the son.
According to the grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in his throat, leg, arm and stomach, but he was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of bullets," said the boy's grandmother Delores Mellenez to the television company.
"I can't believe it."
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and he has several surgerys.
The family tells the TV company that they think the boy's gonna make it.
He was starting the first class at the local sub-class.
Brown was one of four people who was shot in the town of Germantown.
Two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man were also targeted at the shooting.
Another 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and two others were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found on the front seat of a car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating if one of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a cross between many armed men.
The site of the event was filled with a string gun type of seals, which are derived from various types of anti-circumvention weapons.
"It is absolutely clear that this was the ongoing battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
There have been several armed fighters, and they have been actively involved in the shooting", Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and I hear the police are going through surveillance videos.
The second victim of the shooting in the city this week was a girl whose hand was mistrusted by her playing on Tuesday from her home in the town of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Lauie?
In this name, I call women the Olympic Team of Telecommunications, and there are more than one reason why.
Firstly, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin-like women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female gymnast has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were at pigs 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a surprise winner for the races, and the whole of America was cheering up.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez, as well as the amazing and surprising and master-sellering programmes.
Simone became a fourth consecutive American on Thursday, who won gold in a women's individual contest.
Teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
The vision is like this at the top of the species, but it does not look like it's going to be around the globe at the same time.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five"), because in the next Olympic Team of Teline Power, there will be only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality is, however, that commercialisation is a very expensive sport and gymnastics practice mainly in private commercial gain schemes, which are maintained by their parents. Parents are paid by training expenses, facilities, trips, residences, competition fees, hotel fees (e.g. trainers, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most of the euro-areas are located in wealthy residential areas which are able to support activities.
The teaching of policy-makers takes place in these seminars, and this means expensive and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
Coach Timee Boorman and Coach Laurie Hernandez, Maggie Hayey, have both coached the species’s hobby since they started their training.
We need to organise more affordable and better accessible telepower education for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm for Simone, Gabby and Laurie have been raised.
I was founded 20 years ago by my own CSI Foundation.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for more than 15 000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin Americans) who have been exposed to national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities to my hometown in Detroit to offer a high-quality telepower service for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic species.
Telecommunications develops strength, lightness and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lasting benefits of life and supports good health and success in school and work life.
This team has inspired the enthusiasm of thousands of young girls who now want to start a television performance, and it is absolutely awesome.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison's true "girl power", which you demonstrated when you won the Olympic gold, and the fact that you motivated so many young girls from so many backgrounds to start their way into prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new laws and preparations for new laws.
Ministers wanted to decide on any changes to the remuneration and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association) of doctors, but 37 000 of those taking part in the vote were rejected by 58% of the 37 000 junior physicians, i.e. a specialist physician.
In July, Minister of Health Hunt announced plans to make an agreement for an early date and said that the British Public Health System (NSS) was "no country" and that all further delays were harmful to employees and patients.
The first drivers will move to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care in non-social times.
Ellen McCourt, president of BMA's Committee on Junioris, gave an opinion last night, saying: "The drivers are still very busy with the proposed agreement, which is a particular fear that it will stimulate the current labour market crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks since the first doctors are being transferred into the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because the time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has been reluctantly and sometimes without even responding in any way.
Even so, even though Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt has to act now, repeal the implementation of the Agreement and respond to the concerns of train doctors.
If this is not the case, the junior doctors will be ready for new work-related measures."
At the end of April, the last strike delayed nearly 13,000 routine measures and 10,000 reception periods when nurses and consultants were asked to help stop doctors to watch the strike.
Ministers hoped to complete the dispute on amendments by concluding a renewed agreement with the British trade union staff representing doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend's salary for 54 000 junior doctors who would be involved in the contract.
The Director-General of NHS, Daniel Mortimer, appealed to the junior doctors that they would not start a new strike.
Mortimer says: "There is very little or nothing to achieve through labour operations, but they create pressure on teams and services already operating at extreme limits, and they cause care, anxiety and disturbances to patients, health care professionals and their families.
Over the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Committee on Juveniles, and together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role of supervisor and the detection of shortcomings.
The workers were hopeful that continued positive commitment to other important issues such as development, flexibility in education, additional training for workers, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, educational leave and gender pay gap in the care sector were a sign of how seriously workers, the Health Education England responsible for health education and health services and the Ministry of Health want to stick to agreements concluded in November, February and May."
A medicine paying approximately 2,40 € per day may reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of heart attack patients are receiving a dose of approximately 2,40 € a day when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and to longer term use.
The anticoagulant ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or new heart attack.
The UK Public Health System (NHS) and the NICE (national Institute for Health and Clinical Experience) have instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE (national Institute for Health and Clinical Experience) now under the United Kingdom Public Health System (NHS) has instructed that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140 000 people are having a heart attack every year, one in four of which is going to reinvent a heart attack or have stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fat component that builds on the blood vessels' walls that produces patches.
If a patch breaks, it can produce a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot goes off, it can pass with a blood circulation and prevent blood flow into the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new seizure is greater in people who have had a heart attack at times.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, which is sold in the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the probability of interpreters.
In the latest NICE draft Recommendation, it is recommended that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg 12 months and then reduced to 60 milligrams and aspirin given twice a day for a further three years.
Professor Carole Longson says: "Although effective treatment methods are available to prevent disease progression and symptoms, up to a quarter of those who have a heart attack receive a new seizure or stroke – often fatal consequences.
Fear of transformation can have a very negative effect on the quality of life of man.
We have obtained evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Recommendations on temporary use of ticagrelor to increase treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period of time.
Due to a climate that elects a political correctness, the voting tone in Muslim areas flourished.
The former mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, former mayor of the former Mayor of the Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman, was fired last year due to corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The political correction climate led to the closure of the eyes from a wide range of elections in Muslim communities, to reveal today's published government report.
Former government Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, the election observers and the city councils that they have closed their eyes from the electoral culture "for the hypersensitivity of ethnicism and religion".
According to Pickles, former Minister of State for State Administration and the current force figure of corruption, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside the voting stations in order to protect the feared voters.
He suggests that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they have come to vote.
At the moment, the voter should only state his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to decoupling the fingers into an unsolicited mosaic after voting so that no one can vote twice.
There should be more protection for the publishers, says Sir Eric.
He called for better access of journalists to government documents and decisions of informal committees and working groups.
"The aim is not only to prevent wager farming, but also to combat corruption and fraud against economic interests and the fight against culture that favours them in wider local governments," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report following the election scandal in East London following the election of the Tower Hamlet.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that then mayor Lutfur Rahman would be separated from his duties due to corruption and numerous forms of illegal practices.
The Court found that Rahman’s “mortal mischievously” Muslim community’s religious feelings and undermined its critics by accusing them of racism and Islamistism.
Rahman was said to "as the basis for his campaign to be used, that it was the religious duty of every faithful Muslim to vote for him".
Even 300 were questionable or sincere given to a person who voted to act as some other person.
According to Sir Eric, the evidence of virtuos was obtained from all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about postal culture, where members of the high-ranking Muslim community were told that they had pushed people to vote for their choice of candidates.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including the requirement for an identity card at the polling station.
The report says: "There is evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minority groups, particularly women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of older members, in particular in Pakistan and Bangladesh-based communities."
"It was a concern that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such an activity because of the "politically correct" ethnicism and the hypersensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals for a clean system, including banning the processing of postal voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent the "coupling" of votes.
The report under consideration by Theresa May also calls for more stringent checks in the context of registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of the options in which voters would be required to present their identity certificate before the vote.
Pouring the fingers into an unsolicited pattern after the vote so that no one can vote twice.
Regular checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
The introduction of a three-year limit for requests from an automatic post-post vote.
Disable the processing of votes and letters of mail sent by registered mail from political activists.
Police have the right to establish security chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the law making it easier to raise fears under the Act of the People Act of 1983 on the extension of voting rights.
Prohibition of photography in polling stations.
Only allow English to be allowed at voting stations (except Wales).
Strengthening education in order to ensure that the staff monitors the rule that only one person can go to the voting box at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London Police and considers the London Police to be "mortal" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlet case.
"The Electoral Court fired Lutfur Rahman and his representative because of corruption and a number of illegal practices", he says.
"He was found guilty of no doubt and the evidence of criminal law exceeded many grounds."
He also criticised the inefficient 'sufficient checks' by the departments responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
"The decision of the sitting last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake-up," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is proud of its inheritance as a mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation threatens the worrying and covert elections and bans it by some people."
The Olympic biker's appearance of an Olympic biker with Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Du Catherine and other doubles are in the Rio Olympic Olympics at the Rio Olympic Olympics.
This week, the fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics were riding from Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a French cyclist, with an amazing likelihood of similarity to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But, according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic rep is not the only champion of the championship, who is fighting with a well-known person.
In the interests of Rio's competitions and of all the well-known faces of our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all Olympics whose similarity with Hollywood celebrities is obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellisoni (vas.) is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Duchess Catherine's double spirit, many people have listed in social media how one of the archbishops could be an actress's double brother Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a team of American men, caused a storm on Twitter after images of him published, in which he quickly resembles the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the social media noise and admitted that since he was a child, he was reminded of DiCaprio.
"I don't see the probability of being so great, maybe with the exception of the beard and the mustache," said Brady Huffington Post to Brady Huffington.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'll take this as a compliment."
In London’s 2012 competitions, British short-hyperist Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were brought up with an even more of these races.
Big-eyed Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina has been called Gloria Estefan, a Cuban-American singer.
On the other hand, a South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgheia has been compared with Matthew Morrison, known as Glee TV series, for years.
This user says Nathan Adrian is a "alketic version" of the Inception film actor.
Similarly, for a long time it has been listed as a tennis star, Rafael Nadalin and an actor Josh Hartnett, which is highlighted by both strong angles and lips.
Swim silver medalist, Russian Yulia Efimova reminds actress Annalynne McCordia, not only because of its beautifully tanned skin and light hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian is a fan of "athetic version of Joseph Gorgon Levit".
These two iron women, the football star Hope Solo (vas.) and Jennifer Carpenter, an actor in the Dexter series, remind each other of their face and face.
It's not the only one: this Twitter user was delighted when others also saw the odds.
This user wonders whether it's a good reason for a couple's probability.
A twiittaer recently expressed his joy when "other people on the Internet agree with the coherence between Hope Solon and Jennifer Carpenter".
The American football star and the Dexter series actor really resemble each other’s face and face.
Many have also noticed the appearance of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney smiled and gold won by the gymnastic Gabby Douglas and Anna in a broad smile of the Union.
CBC's Olympic commentator has been apologizing to the Chinese swimmer "deviled like a pig" after his apology.
Byron MacDonalds' analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth year old instead of women's 4 x 200-metre free travel message, CBC's direct Olympic report viewers were bored on Wednesday by CBC's direct Olympic report.
The Canadian public service company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "devild sharks" and "dead as a pig" during the race.
Analyzer Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to drop his own opinions at the end of the final of the women's 4 x 200 m free-at-air message.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC's explanatory notes, was heard as saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, he left on speed and died like a pig.
Thank you."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim message at 1:57.79, and remained 1.61 seconds from Canada Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canadians to swim in China.
The viewers around Canada react quickly after shocking the tone and language of the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane twiittanis: "Did CBC's reporter just say that 14-year-old Chinese bitch died like a pig?
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the mission."
Ai Yanhan, who was 4 x 200 metres in the final of a free message from women, was described as: "This small 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly completed with fierce byron MacDonald’s critical comments, and many insisted that he resigned.
The licensees didn't arrest their words when they heard how reckless Byron Macdonald was.
He wrote: "Wu #Byron MacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist group.
Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC delegation, quickly apologized to MacDonaldi's speeches: "We apologize for the comment on the idea of an ideal.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
CBC finally had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had twiited their reply to the comment.
The Commentary College, Scott Russel, had to apologize for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and glued its regret over 90 other twiitative comments on MacDonald's speeches.
A public apology was also offered quickly by the TV company.
"We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for the fact that they were sent to us.
Last night, we quickly asked our viewers for forgiveness, and we also offered an apology to our social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Byron's comments were related to the bathing performance, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was unfortunate, and Byron is very sorry for what he said."
Thursday night, MacDonald expressed his apologies for sending him along the road and tried to express his protests by saying that it was not meant for him personally.
"I would like to apologize for the comments I made last night after the women's communication", MacDonald said in his Olympic broadcast to CBC.
"I took the swimmer out, not the person.
It is clear that I didn't mean to say anything bad, and I'm very sorry."
In Primark, a woman in the middle of the trade turned shocks to her customers because she was shocked by the customers.
The customers didn't know where to look when she was taking off in the middle of Primark in order to match underwear.
He continued to worsen the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them off his feet and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually tried four underpants at a store in Folkeston, Bouverie Place, Uoverie Place.
Primark chain shop at Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping center, Primark chain, where a woman tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on shelf.
At the same time, Mother Jenny Davidson of two children at the same time reported that after experimenting with underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells us about what happened: "The people had no faith in their eyes.
She stood in the middle of the store, took her underpants off the shelf, took off her own triples and underwear and dressed them on top.
He didn't try to do it unobtrusively, but he did it with no shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took his underpants off his feet, and apparently didn't like them because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it three more times before he finally decided not to hold them off, dress them and walk out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes... or think about the person who would finally buy the underwear he'd been wearing."
The 33-year-old Davidson, who lives in Kenttown, continues: "How disgusting to think that someone will take the underwear that someone else has used and has not cleaned up."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the trade staff strived to remove these clothes from the sale after she had left – which is right.
It would be awful to take new underwear home and notice that someone else has come up with them without having them washed up after that," adds Davidson.
Primark's editor commented: "Primark is aware of the situation that happened on Tuesday, 9 August, at the Folkeston movement.
All those products have been removed from sales."
This is how you defend your defence against the armed attack with the help of Krav Mag with the help of Krav Mag.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the great mayor Rhon Mizrachi, New York, who lived in New York, and we asked for advice on how to cope with a gun in close proximity with an evasive robbery or assaulter.
The video shows how you can defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker approaches you or is behind you.
If the attacker approaches from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and get out of the firing line, says Mizrachi.
After this, grab the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder, and strike the attacker into the face with your loose elbow.
Then kick the attacker with a knee in his neck, and when he goes down the pain with a double coefficient, stick him in his face with a gun on his tip and repeat by holding a gun directed at him.
The technology is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches from the front. You have to move away from the shooting line, grab the weapon and turn it so that the attacker cannot be fired.
At the same time, place your weight on the weapon and strike the attacker with the fist in the chest. Turn the weapon away from the attacker's grip, retreat and keep the weapon focused on the attacker's attack.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video how Mizrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest thing you can do is get rid of the kidnapper by handing out your cash — unless you are the headmaster of the Krav Mag.
World traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirty places.
The British world traveler put his resistance and chaos reflexes on a tough test by licking Europe's smoother and more hostile places.
Ian Wright, 51, Suffolian runner and travel guide writer, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by licking the euro label, handcuffed by Piccadilly Circles, train's toilet sweeper and Russian public telephone.
Before licking Wright measured the objects on a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers where the tongue was being pushed.
The test was conducted with a documentary picture of Ian Wright – after the internal force, and its results were surprised.
The idea of licking the train's laundee button can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals on his way to determining good bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused nothing but a mouth of evil taste.
Ian Wright began to become known for his travel program, where he tested his intestine for endurance by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
The licking of the rail station handrails and the wash-off button in the bathroom undoubtedly challenged Wright's resistance to resistance.
Wright says in the document, "I've been rather anxious about my health since I was a kid and I've put my mouth in a variety of ways, like soil, worms and evil."
In the film he really showed himself to be a taxable reputation of his reputation.
The border was only met in a tragic public bathroom in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample from the sample.
For the sake of comparison, it should be noted that the number of arms that have been compared is usually less than 60.
The track came up in the Russian general bathroom where Wright refused to swallow when the luminometer measured the result of 4000 units – in the newly-refugeed hands the same figure is less than 60.
Wright, together with Valo, explores the documentary film Ian Wright – on the trail of internal force, where the number of bacteria is displayed in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the smell of the worst that I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
Nothing's dirtyer than that one.
It must be so disgusting that I really don't lick anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film after Ian Wright – in collaboration with Valio on the internal force.
From the menu Wright received lactic bacteria and vitamin C and D supplements Valio Gefilus, which helps to strengthen the intestinal good bacterial strain and resistance ability.
Niko Vuurenmaa, the category manager of the selection of snacks, juices and novelty products, says: "We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something fascinating about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and eventually we came to the conclusion that we had the idea of asking Ia to come."
Health in salt has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into a wider context instead of simply talking about products and to tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resilience.
Health has become a global trend, and with the help of the document we can provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
The film also tells our sense of humor!"
Tom Hakala added to this: "Let's say that I lost my respect for Ian if he had forgotten some of the items we've asked for, like a disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, swallowing some of the objects was easier for Ian, while some were pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape."
In a survey carried out by Valo in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents added lactic bacteria, especially to the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent reported that they used at least occasionally products with added lactic bacteria.
The wedding family destroyed the town's owner's rental building in Salth, Cornwall, in the city's Cornwall.
The family left 50 000 pounds of damage to the rental house of the city after they had been evicted because of the terrorisation of the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been released from their apartment in Cornwallin Saltah following complaints against numerous couples.
When the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, representatives of the rental company said that they were shocked to be in the repair service.
There were velvet openings on the wall, the floor boards had been torn off, the trash had been spread to the floor and the walls had been mutilated with graffiti.
The couple have now moved, and they are believed to live in a private dwelling.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency (Cornwall Housing), says he's afraid that it might not be possible to save the dwelling anymore.
He says: "This has been a great nightmare for people living here, no one should have to tolerate this kind of thing.
It is a great deal of weight, as the property is likely to become known not as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
Family is in bad shape, as is its name."
There were three boys who lived in the apartment at times. According to the police, the family's fears included street fights in baseball countries, intimidating nearby residents, drug abuse, drug use and transmission, and loud screaming, quarreling and cursing.
Skeldon, the 47-year-old who signed the lease, received an order concerning the indirect behaviour of the lessor in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms in the building under the sink.
The house had been used to selling drugs, and the floors had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency cleared the couple's coercive measures this week after giving them the first 11 weeks of extra time to move away voluntarily.
The simplified neighbors were grateful for the wedding — they said that life was hell on earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door for 20 years, and this whole time has been hard.
The police have been here an incredibly many times."
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet and we're not used to it.
It'll be wonderful now that they're finally evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, reports that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were invited to attend regularly.
Riskie and old toys had been thrown in a busy wall of the apartment building.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her own or his family's conduct, since the decision is always the last measure that Cornwall's housing agency is considering.
This case was very difficult because behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shockingly visible to the neighborhood.
I am grateful to my task force, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the Community who took part in the work and were willing to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of our neighbours and give you a message that non-social behaviour will not be accepted."
Fitzpatrick tells me that the three sons of the family had all lived in a house in different times, but were already twenty.
The house in one bedroom after the wedding, there was a dirty pillow found in the house.
Residential workers now have to clean out the waste waste containers around the house.
The police made a flat in 2014 a raid and found more than 70 grams of hemp and more than a hundred pounds of hemp and other articles as well as 1 700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received a fine when he was found guilty of possession of class B drugs with a view to selling it.
He claimed that the money was in 2013 for the gravestone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have heard that they moved to a private dwelling in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms had been shattered with graffiti.
The police say that they demand a change for the tenants who break the lease rules.
The police at Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall say that this wedding is a clear warning to the tenants who are constantly threatening the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can behave in what they want without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and social behaviour and continue to cooperate with their partners in order to protect our communities.
Land flying, the shorelined by military jet jets scared tourists in Portugal, in Portugal, tourists were alarming in Portugal.
Solar ministers experienced the shock of their lives in Portugal's Aveiro.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane crashed to a alarming low.
According to the Air Force, this was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were forced to flee when a low-flight jet crashed across the entire beach.
The dramatic images show how an army plane comes to a close contact with a sandy beach from tourists taking the sun in North Portugal's Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Farmers rose up with their concerns about the joy of the jet engine, which began to be famous before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the images of a dramatic past flight and the videos of holidayers in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It passed the beach twice at a very low level, and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to hit the ground."
And the Aryan adds, "I was surfing, and I was sure that the machine would fall on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro experienced a shock when the plane suddenly came out and flew under a alarmingly low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, which meant that the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly a little lower than normal, because smoke caused by nearby forest fires was damaging visibility, but according to the Air Forces, this did not threaten the safety of anyone.
Forest fires have caused damage to parts of mainland Portugal and have killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force today reported that, in view of the poor visibility of the sum and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low that the pilot had to fly so much low.
The machine was a training flight for which the pilot was requested to identify fishing vessels.

A certain number of criminals prior to - criminal investigation helps to resolve crimes and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police offices in Finland has been the RTA unit, i.e. criminal intelligence and analysis unit, since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outwardly invisible.
At the Hämee Police Department, the unit consists of four police officers in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by the solution placed by a sergeant.
He's a firing officer in Lieutenant Lade.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian costumes.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and need, considers Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides other police with various explanations.
In a wedding, it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
The reform of the latest working practices, the reform of the latest latest working practices, reform reform of the latest latest working practices, reform reform the most recent working practices
The establishment of units of analysis is the reform of the latest police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make the police go more and less often than when they get the alarm.
By means of information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities will be targeted at where the most necessary is the most.
A crime intelligence centre was established with the reform of the police, under three national units, and with each police department its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre in the connection with the Central Criminal Policy in Vantaa is a national leader of the operation.
The PTR units work according to their name from the police, Customs and Border Guard Department.
The RTA units, for their part, work in shared areas according to the police authorities and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Knowledge extends beyond the territory of a territory beyond the territory of a territory.
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the role of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police area.
Knowledge also extends beyond the boundaries of the own institution, as it does crime.
The RTA staff have better ICT skills for the basic police.
The unit will seek, by means of registers, an alert function database and findings, to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, product criminal offences or similar crimes.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important instruments in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the factor is made up of a certain kind of picture.
The order may be made either by way of action or by person depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes from their mistakes.
RTA employees do not travel through the city's necks, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals as their own are not reported, as it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent the police's anti-crime companies.
The police will publicly inform you if this is an indication of the threat they pose.
For example, this was the initial period of news, the means of marking empty dwellings used in housing accidents.
The authors put the apartment in the outer door with a stick, a pin or a tape panel, where they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
The ex-ante investigation material shall be made public to at least the interested parties.

In Syria, a father-related London-related schoolgirl girl killed her death in Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria, Syria,
News reports that one of the three British school students who joined Is last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasmina Akujee tells the girl's family that Sultana died in Syria in Raqqqa a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in the Russian airs of Rafqan, who is the Father's base in Syria, told me ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was just planning to escape from the war from rushing into the country and returning to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will act as a warning example and will, so that people can understand that this is a real risk when they go to the war zone, and who makes people give up their decision to leave," says Akunjee.
Sultana rose in February 2015 together with two other Eastern schoolgirls on a plane to Turkey and continued on a bus to the Syrian border by bus.
The family had heard that Sultana had married to Isis warrior in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's name Garland's highest court if he is elected.
Harry Reid, democratic leader of the Senate, says he is convinced that the President-in-Office of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate Republican representatives have not agreed to confirm the name Garland after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to President Mitch McConnell, the next President will choose a person to fill the place of the Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalal.
Reid said at the phone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton's choice of Garland with great certainty.
Reid's editor later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "stop the boat" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Supreme Court of the United States of America under the jurisdiction of Columbia County Court of Appeal.
Reid says that the Republicans that are prevented by the name of Garland are the presidential candidate Donald Trump's 'no' and 'presents'.
According to him, Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, lower calendars belong equally to women and men as well as to men.
Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemer and brings to the market the film of the 1970's style and Pirell's inspiration calendar for 2017.
Instead of publishing models, they want to find the highest models of their next generation of NU Muse calendar 2017 for their next generation.
Steve Shaw, CEO of Treats, told me earlier this year that his naked film is different from that of the old school's Playboys, for he said: "Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this for women."
Apparently, he thinks about the calendar the same way.
"We must bring back timeless and classic nakedness, where women, wherever men are, can not bother to enjoy these women's praiseful images and inspire them," says the press release on the Shaw calendar.
"Women certainly want to participate in this project, because it will be a beautiful work of art."
The model of the calendar is to be sent via the network or to participate in open selections organised in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl's charm: who's buying records?
Single, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on the name of the angry protest, not everyoneOne-oneSevere-oldMies, this argument is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov's research firm, there is no millennial-generation boom behind the new coming of much-speaking vinyl plates when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is a middle-age uprising.
The age of the person who recently bought the vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, the least likely buyers are the age group 18-24.
It is also not just the desire of athletes to hug discs, but the importance is emotional: older customers of vinyl plates are much more likely to hide their feelings (56% v. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% v. 66%).
But is YourGov's results true?
If this blog was a television broadcast, the camera would follow me when I walked along the live Soho Street, the gray jacket on my top of the jewelry, and I'd be careful to bend my hand into a cup and say something about tradition, like, "Let's find out."
So let's find out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rustiness, since hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises before private entrepreneurs own, there are still a lot of special-plate stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I apply very close to visiting men in these stores and try to assess their age and nature by observing their findings.
In Glasgow, Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (a client of two young women at the moment, three middle-aged men) to the Reckles Records (a client of eight middle-aged men at the moment, one probably two-six women) is on a meeting trip to London for the afternoon and spends extra time visiting the retail offering.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I think I'm," he says.
"I have about 3000-400 plates."
These plates fill his living room wall, as shown in the picture. (Stutart sent me an e-mail, I did not follow him home.)
The reason he has acquired such a large number of albums and singles is partly available in his income. He is now able to buy albums to which he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again things that he had to sell when he was young and without money.
"How many things happened in the late '60s and the early '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get 'em," he says.
He agrees that the buyers who buy vinyl plates are more likely to be introverters who enjoy their company and say, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's a devil."
Wez, who works at Sister Ray, 25, believes that many of their clients are suitable for YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human flow, which has been affected by mediahystering, and these people have heard about the coming of the vinyl plates again and feel they are now forced to buy their old plates back.
"On the basis of my discussions, people had usually abandoned their meetings in 1998 or 1999 at the same time.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back," he says.
This could explain a certain-age vinyl-rich boom.
What, then, about the alleged emotional significance of audio recordings?
In just a few seconds, in a movement such as Phonica, you can see that they provide comfort to similar types of the community.
According to Wez, some of the older clients have become upset, especially with the uninboxed payment system.
The digital world may be dazzling some of the vinyl fans, to which returning to familiar disk bags means permanence and reminds me of the happiness days of youth.
"I think that sometimes a hole or material property will be filled in for some kind of comfort," says Wez.
"I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe that so too many others.
It is an easy way to get ideas elsewhere."
"We're like a social worker!" "We're a top-level worker." "Wez's a co-worker behind the board."
The ICM opinion survey carried out in April revealed that nearly 50% of the purchases of the vinyl album in the previous month had not yet listened to their album.
The opinion poll also indicated that 41% is a disc player they never use, and 7% of the customers of the vinyl plate have no own record player at all.
At this point in the news broadcast, I would probably look like a serious face while wearing a stack of bossa nova sizes.
There is also a "pocalyptic phenomenon" that is found by Jonny, 42, the salesman of the Sounds of the Universe (the customers at that time three middle-aged men) who are currently engaged in the creation of the Vinyl Records.
"A few customers have recently entered the store and said he doesn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead disc so that he can put it in his shelf", Jonny says.
"The share of such customers is not large, but they do.
For them, material is more important than music.
Our customers tell us they don't have a disc player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teenagers who are just starting a hobby."
The client will be considerably more varied in the Fopp, to which I will be next. The movement has dedicated a whole layer to the vinyl plates.
There are seven-year-old couples, photos of tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The differences between customers are pleased, although the mood is not as relaxed as in previous movements: echoing the bending jazz instead of the Wild Beasts' latest sex with a taped synthesizer.
No clients look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fopp for a few minutes and watched different discount records.
He's more like watching than making shopping.
He says his income is small, so it is not possible for him to collect albums.
"They pay a lot of money.
The music is easy to listen to from the computer or otherwise, but the wine's fineness is ...", he lets a lovely snoop and goes on:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they'd be jumping to the tails, but instead, they're gathering around the Polaroid cameras for a moment, and I see my father and daughter, who are thinking about buying a Crossley disc player.
On the left, there is a stairway filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac plates: a mix of modern music and classics, key discs for any average collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they're just interior elements and part so high that they don't even reach them.
They're a clean "art vinyl" bond.
However, given that all means of getting attention to these records may mean more money for the sector and send a few customers to the search for Soho, there is little to complain about.
There is no surprise that a population that is most likely to have more time and money than most people have at the same time also the group that uses the most money for luxury purposes, such as vinyl plates.
Although my research suggests that the results of YouGov are true, at least in Soho’s record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which actually exist in both stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely attached to school or working life.
I'm sure they're not going to spend their Thursday mornings masquerading at Berwick Street's record stores, sipping records and avoiding the 30-year-old who's playing television, who's staring scaryly and staring at the men of the middle age who are not unwittingly-seen.
The Holker, i.e. the ice fish, is the largest live vertifest live vertif — video report.
According to researchers, the world's largest living vertebrates are icefish.
According to Detective Julius Nielsen, the oldest ice age was the age of 272 to 12 years in the study, with a length of five metres in length.
The French court rejected the application for decommitment of the trades of the jungle camp.
The French court has rejected the application from the Calais authorities in which they claimed that tens of temporary shops and restaurants would be landed by thousands of refugees on the jungle camp.
At the hearing held this week, the Calais authorities put forward arguments that the State should be allowed to break down 72 temporary trades for refugee camps.
According to Calais' preferred authorities, these shops and restaurants must be removed because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they are associated with fire and hygiene risk.
Humanitarian aid groups told the court that shops and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as the free meals provided by the state support organisation and other bodies are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
It is their opinion that temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and food to those who need them.
The Lillen Court ruled that there was no legal basis for deporting 72 temporary traders, but considered the concerns of Calais Prefect "to be fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla says that camp stores, cafes and restaurants have far greater meaning than providing food to people who "live extremely unstable conditions".
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the landing was the camp's Jungle Book Kids coffee, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, lessons from English and French and asylum for hundreds of minors without guardians, whose position is the most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed the address where children’s cafe is required to be stored.
According to the letter sent to Guardians, closing it would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.
On Friday, the two charity organisations, Help Refuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that after summer's arrivals increased, the population of the jungle camp has risen to over 9 000 lives.
In Finland, food prices fall clearly faster than in the EU on average.
In Finland, food is getting very cheap for consumers' joy and harm for producers.
In Finland, food prices have decreased by nearly 5 per cent in three years, whereas on average in EU countries its price decreased by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one-percent higher than food.
In the last three years, food prices have decreased most in Finland in the EU countries with the same wage levels as in Finland.
Compared to the UK alone, food prices have decreased faster than in Finland.
This information is reflected in the publication by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager, Ilkka Lehtinen, who was published in the Tie & Trendt blog.
The site compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices went near the price level in 1994.
The situation had to be alarmed.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came from EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper year by year.
The current price is the price of Russian food import bans, which have rejected food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have decreased.
"The policy has helped the Finnish consumer at a short time", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
Large trade chains S-group and Kesko have both calculated their prices.
The consumer price competition has been shown to be the most visible promotional campaign.
However, Finland is still not the standard of affordable food, even though the price of food has decreased greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a level of pay similar to that of Finland.
According to the paper, VAT is significantly affected by the price of food to be sold in Finland.
He found that if the comparable countries had the same percentage of VAT, Finland would sell food at the same level as third countries.
The paper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only Germans and Dutchs would sell cheaper food than Finns would.
"If we want to get to the prices of food in the old EU countries, VAT must be halved by the EU's average level and continue the price competition", Lehtinen writes.
It notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School is no longer the old age of school.
If you return to school, you may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been developed, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic period in all primary schools.
It is a guide that all schools in Finland operate.
Schools will decide on the details themselves, but the plan will indicate the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, a book of beauty is given up, and schools start to practice encoding.
Sweden's education will begin by the end of the sixth grade, and social education will start reading by four.
However, the major change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
In this way, school visits are being tried to make it more interesting.
The most long-life verteb who had the most long-old vert for the rest of the world was found, the ice icefs can live up to 400 years.
It is known as Greenlandese (Somniosus microcephalus) to reach sexual maturity at the age of 150.
It may then live another 250 years, report a new survey.
The figures make the species the most long-lived vertebrae in the world.
In the county, it is passed over only by the Icelandic wolf whose oldest known individual has been scheduled for 507 years.
Greenlandn sharks are swimming down the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females are longer than dogs, they can grow up to over five meters.
As the growth rate is slow, according to the associations only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
How long for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice-creams from the 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radio-civering of eye lenses.
The average age of the case was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502-cent amazones, were exposed to the age of 335 and 392 years.
Since it has been found in previous studies that agnostics reach more than a square metre of fertility, researchers calculated that at that stage they were about 150 years old.
Thesis was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people from Stockmann - no less than 300 sellers were taken off. No less than 300 sellers are being deducted.
Almost 300 employees are expelled from Stockmaa.
The joint ventures in a firm in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of these matches, about 300 jobs are reduced, the majority of which are executed as dismissals", Stockmann says in his communication.
According to that, the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
There were about 3 000 employees involved in the first discussions on Stockmann.
At the time of their start, the reduction need was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction in the reduction is intended to cover about EUR 20 million per year of cost savings that will be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an effectiveness programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is that Stockmann's difficulties are to make the goods trade profitable.
Although the adjusted operating result of the group improved by EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, the trade in goods continues to lose.
According to Stockmann v CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in the stores have not been subject to the company’s objectives.
"Also, unfortunately, it is necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail delivers positive operating results in 2018", Veijalainen states in the communication.
The result of the second quarter performance improvement was particularly due to the good success of Lindex in the supply chain.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4,1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from the previous year.
The corrected operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.

The Kenyan public sports team is shaking a strange explanation for the attack of the Dopingskdaal coach coach.
Kenyan Public Sports Coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it became apparent that Anzrah was performing as a country team athlete in Doping test.
The news office AP told me that the athlete, when Anzrah tried to perform, is the 800-meter star of Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, head of the Kenyan national team leader, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to the attention of the authorities in Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he " committed a crime against Kenya's national team".
He appeared as a athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use", Kip Keino, President of the Kenya Olympic Committee, ran the news agency for Reuters.
The Olympics' public sports starts on Friday, and Roth is supposed to run right at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was established last year in the World Cup on the fourth quarter, and is an advance of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan public sports team claimed that Anzrah went through a athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in a racehouse.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sports fleet is empty in its void.
Where is everybody?
At least at the Olympic Stadium of Rio, they're not watching sports in general.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for public sport medals, but the world's top people were able to present their skills to an empty viewer.
Rio's organisers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first day's breakfast tickets and 65 per cent of the afternoon's tickets have been sold.
There were four years ago in London, where the stadium was admiring people.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
Even before public sport, the Olympic Olympics have taken note of the fact that they are looking at the Olympic Olympics in Rio.
For example, thousands of empty pensions have been seen in the parks of rugby, melon and horse riding.
While Brazil's medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach flight ball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the show was full of them.
After the Brazilian twinkish, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12 000 people's ratings were filled with about 30 per cent.
At least, bad business is explained by the fact that Brazil, which struggles in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitors, and many Olympics are strange to the Brazilians who used to play football.
In fact, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not be reached in full in the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, informing me this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets were sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left for sale," Andrada said after Reuters.
8,5 million tickets were sold from the Olympic Olympics in London, which cost nearly half of them more than in Rio.
The prices for tickets in Rio ranged from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 for openings.
Over half of the flags pay less than EUR 16 per ticket.
In the Olympics in London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not allowed yet, because organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
However, in Rio, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in less well-known species in the country, such as golf and rugby.
Rio's stadium had enough empty places this morning.
Even the beach-flying ball on the way to Copaca has not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Central Salo was racing in London in 2012.
That's enough for a lot of magazines.
New way to protect nature - get the right to a rural rural area - Get the right to a territory
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through the newest means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural habitats.
After that, private, business and entities can redeem their right to land by means of money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The country is virtually divided into blocks that are available to those willing to obtain right against payment of payment by the holder.
The administrator receives a right of veto of 187 square blocks, which means that in practice, each holder does not need to be approved if the destination of the land is to be changed.
Access rights can also be acquired for more than one lock.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be submitted as a inheritance or a gift.
There is no need to leave to carry a Bandero or chain itself somewhere to protect nature", Juha Levekkan, who has acquired control over his company, is founded by Juha Levekärkan, who has acquired control over his own company.
The acquirer receives accurate location information in his cell, which enables him/her to visit in a section, for example.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the holders of the right-of-occupied rights are listed on the same map as the country's parcel data.
The final fabric sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest for the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would act somehow vaguely or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural habitats in such a way as to be inviolable and at peace.
The Foundation will acquire land either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of the rights of the holder, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It is also intended outside Finland's borders and is planning to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Wheel thieves torture large cities, worst of all, Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality of residence.
Cyclops torture Turkey from the great cities of Finland.
This year, more circles have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, the number of bicycles and their parts per thousand inhabitants have been stolen in January to August of this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four out of five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Couvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts occur in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others", described Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why Turku has stolen more wheels than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The generality of the events can be affected by how much the city moves on the wheel and how much the wheel is at all", explains Sergeant Teemu's Man.
The police government Tommi Reen is quite expecting that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise at the top of the line.
The number of bike thefts is largely based on the number of cities of study and cycling.
There is a close center in Turku, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city, where urban centres are away from each other, and bicycles are not necessarily a priority vehicle", Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police data in January to August have become slightly less of a bike theft than in the corresponding period of the previous year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the fall in recent years, the police will be informed about a limited number of more than 20 000 bike thefts per year.
It means 50-60 files every day and only in Helsinki for about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more of a spin because only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime as regards a bike theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police have been detected.
Typically cleared bike theft is the one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also cases of other investigations where, for example, a stolen circuit can be found in a drug-related apartment", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves will be caught weekly by the exercise itself or by police investigation, tell the senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheel is stolen, for example, from bicycles, indoor courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs, or practically everywhere where they are normally stored.
Individual wheel models are the most stolen like Jopos over the past few years.
The U-lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves, for example for their short-term own use, are riding a wheel, but most of the stolen wheels end up being sold online, for example, for example.
They'll stay on the market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police that stolen wheels would go far beyond the country", Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheels are common Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike, they don't know.
Some may have doubts about it.
The used bike buyer must be aware of the fact that he can commit a hidden crime or a violation of the law.
"The alarm bells should be called if a good-time bike is sold to its bottom," Reen says.
The filter editor, Mr. Severi Hirvi, always has a colourful Nops in Helsinki for his working day.
He's had five bikes, but none has been stolen, and the monster says, "It's never been taken, it's been a good monk."
"Maybe this does not attract thieves, this does not necessarily have a hipster value either," the Helsinkious monster wonders.
Libi Valve, who was quick to deal with the Kiosk in Helsinki Kallio, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike has been rocked against the wall of the box, but in general, Valve is locking his bike on something solid, like a bicycle line.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I've ever owned", the Helsinki student says about his white bike, whose body alone paid about EUR 5 hundred.
"All the time you hear from your friends that the wheel has been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, such dirty boys."
On guard, a bike was stolen from the interior yard of a building company a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve could wait for it to be evacuated.
Under 15-year-olds in charge of their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-light crews known from the United States of America who are familiar with the United States of America.
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-review team is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal circle.
At first, the experiment is applied to persons under 15 years of age who are now subject to non-criminal liability.
The peer-responsor is the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer-review team will discuss what has happened with the offender and impose the penalty.
A week later, the offender himself may join the peer-review team in order to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
The Youth Executive Director, Tommi Laitio, tells us that the model is not tight.
We also have other compromise models that are used in parallel.
"All the young people are directed in a more responsible direction so that they will not ruin the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model for the vertex crew has been taken from the United States where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, not after his first crime, has to face the adult panel, but to reflect on what happened with the same age.
Models have been tested once.
A follow-up of the Services Industry Office in Palmu's service designer, Iikka Lovio, tells us that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before at all.
"It's been a message that you go on the way you choose", Lovio says.
The peer-review team is part of the Helsinki project for immigrants, based on the City of Helsinki and Me- Foundation.
It points out that new practices are offered to all those who need it, not just to the immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican actors want the party to end the Trump campaign to fund the Trump campaign.
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
The letter was published by the US newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it to see it as a draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, President of the Republican National Committee.
Signatures want the money of the party to be directed to Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his recklessness, inability and infidelity, threaten to bring to the vote by these elections," says Politico, according to the letter.
Only direct direction of all possible resources to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning the Trump-created anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, since Trump's chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent over the next week.
Among those who have signed are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is apparently the Republican Andrew Weinstein, a Republican against the Trumps.
According to the politician, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several works by Donald Trump that are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, it is said that he has demonstrated dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 civil servants working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president of the Donald Trump.
Clinton's promise to make it a promising relief for families with children in the United States of America.
In the United States, the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm going to be president so that the US economy would do well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
The Clinton Plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve U.S. infrastructure roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by a large amount of tax increases, in part by means of private money.
The building program is a handbook for American duvets who suffer from the transition of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme for the greatest investment in good paid jobs after World War II.
We are a construction nation, we must go back to building.
Clinton said.
Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the role of families with children who work.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders, pointing out that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be a tax liability, it must pay the tax on income tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he before supported.
"[ as President] I am opposed to all trade agreements which operate against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the financial programme published by the Republican Donald Trump on Monday by the Republican Donald Trump that it would "only favour millions of such ones".
The toughest proposal for a reduction in corporate taxes has ever been by Clinton to call the "Drumpin loophole".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump had not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself made in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton was hovering.
These are Rio viewer numbers: The races have not glued Finnish sides of the squares, but the mobile application is interesting.
Usually sports games can be seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Olympic Olympics in Rio have not reached the peak of ratings.
At least 12 per cent of the population have been glued at the top of the squares: on Tuesday nights, Yle followed 615 000 viewers from the Olympic TV2 at the same time as Yle’s Olympic TV2.
For the sake of comparison: one month ago, the EM races received TV2 at a time of almost 800 000 viewers, and football EM races fairly another million at a time.
Most of the Olympics have so far been interested in Sunday-night biking and the five-day tournament, both reaching almost half a million viewers at the Olympic Games at once.
The head of the Yle sport, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the number of viewers and recalls that viewers are divided for the first time by several different instruments at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are going to choose the Olympics.
The TV2 and Yle Fem channels share the TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports games Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20 000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The figures are lower than in the 2012 London Competitions or in the 2008 Beijing Competitions, but the difference is explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for a lazy interest - if it is now considered to be a lazy person - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some kind of a surprise fight, the interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, sport is only beginning, as are other Finns interested species: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When sport starts, viewers explode.
Yle launched a competition for the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose on the first days of the races in Apple' App Store, Finland for the most downloadable free app.
By Monday, the app was charged 150 000 times.
I'd imagine that we're already on the way to 200 000 downloads.
"We'll get the numbers from the family's viewers only later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not been able to function as expected by all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been using delay and other small technical problems early in life.
Applications have been made with updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio will be visible on Yle channel and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be monitored from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Sound transmits races daily.
The Olympics are not only possible workers for Yle, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018 Olympic sports will be seen on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is your Sun, whose depth is 95.3 meters on Crossside.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, Technical Reconstructor, found a weight of about 20 square feet [20 sq m] on the crossside, based on the deep depth of the dive computer, seemed 104 meters.
In the summer 2014 the Finnish Environment Centre was trying to confirm the observation in vain by means of an advocating.
The method may not be able to find a small depth of 100 meters, and development engineer Jari Hakala says.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
The other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres from Saimaa, Toisve and Lake Main.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sun King's.
In particular, the base of Lake Inari has not been carefully investigated.
"There could well be unknown depths", Kannella wonders.
If deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As a result, your Chief will not be able to reach the ten deepest groups, and Suvasvea will be further away from the lead.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Revised last copy, where the deepest lakes were wrong at average depths.
About the age of tax: The tax on the tax of pensioners is still more severe than the tax on the tax on the tax on pensions.
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that there was a lack of respect under the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised equal treatment over employees.
This is not part of the Government's presentation.
We think that it should definitely be.
The promises given should be shared after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received labour income reductions which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated by the opposition representatives who had advocated the election promises of the Minister for Finance, Alexander Stubbia (Kok.) from the bridges.
Power is safeguarded, it does not grow.
According to Ihalainen, tax reductions are mainly due to security of purchasing power and not to increased purchasing power, as next year no wages will be increased.
He says that tax reduction will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) and Orpo's messages with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with trouble.
He says that respecting the treaty is important for credibility..
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government period.
It's done with the power of the social partners, so you don't have to question it by questioning it.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much for domestic demand and people's own future beliefs.
Long-term unemployment is affected by prolonged unemployment.
The person claims to the government that it would be in the budgetary line to catch the long-term unemployment rate, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17 000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of increasing the employment rate to 72% will be run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social fall in the permit.
Ambassador: In Thai attacks, the Finnish victims are not reportedly known to be victims of Finnish victims.
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be monitored and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary for Thai intended Finnish servants to withdraw their journey due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
Very little Finnish Finns in Thailand in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thai-Taiman travel period is scheduled for the change in the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
In particular, the Embassy has tried to help Finns in Hua Hin to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author.
According to the Westphalen, there are still no data on the unsub of the attacks.
The Ambassador considers that events may be related to the political disparity of the Thai society and to the recent referendum on the constitution of the military train from last week's referendum.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict involving the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, previous attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphhalen.
According to him, the town celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The impact of the attack on the day's course is that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thai Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also excluded, says Thai Police News Office AP.
There are at least four people who have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded throughout the country, such as tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the most popular tourist destination, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current information, they did not require death victims.
Exploded by two explosions from the city's city, the day after the explosion, the day after the explosion, the day after the explosions were launched, and by the day after the explosion, the
In addition, two bombs exploded in Chang Ngas, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, according to the local authorities, four bombs were bombed yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in South Thailand, at the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in each of them.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, for it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao on holiday islands.
The author of the hit did not know what was known.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling military train is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't let people panic anymore, he told the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Prime Minister for Security at least the attacks between Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be monitored and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary for the Finns to withdraw their journey because of the explosions in Thailand, but it is worth following with caution, Westphalen says.
In vulnerable Europeans, vulnerable Europeans.
For the time being very little about attacks and victims during the night.
About last night's attack in Hua Hin, we've had some time to get some more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded, there are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second strike.
Two bombs exploded as an invisible near the known bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated Hua Hin's territory from which it believes it has found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was placed in a flower bench according to the governor of the province.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
CNN's interviewing police chief tells us that two bombs were used to attack Surat Thani as well, which exploded about half an hour every other day.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs blew up in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the women's four-game.
In the United States of America, Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and Russia's Alija Mustafina the third score of 58,665 points with performance.
Biles, 18, reaching out to Rio's competitions for further teaspoons with perman, jump and boom.
Biles has been managing women's gymnastics to an extent in recent years.
He's had eight personal universes for the last three years.
Four matches and permanon champions he has won three times in a row as well as a boom in the last and the second year.
In a U.S. team, the Biles has achieved two team competitions in the world of the world.
It's a bit of a lot of wet, and it's a bit bit of fun at the party.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no influence on tourism".
Esa Huovila, a filmmaker in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think it's going to be any more amazing, then the Finnish entrepreneur in Asia estimates Huovila, who worked in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedy that has tested Thailand in close proximity.
There's always something here.
At first there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these pastes haven't deported tourists, I doubt this one either.
The department of the Huovla Company is located a few hundred metres from the scene of the explosion.
The party heard about the blow from its own employees.
The employee called about nine local hours and said that you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local workers arrived at the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to the Friday celebration in Thailand.
The tunnel was calm and the movement of the main street was permitted to open at approximately 10:00 local time.
Many on the beach had never even heard of attacks.
By half at 3:30, Thailand's time in Patong had been normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the site of the impact, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovola.
Later, this car was seen in Krunuka on Jouxholmine.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for recognition markings hiding in a close to six.
The other guy got caught right away.
The other one went away, but later he was found in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and serious damage to the vehicle.
The police thank you for giving me clues.
Research Director of Russia's leadership changes: Clear move aside.
In Russia, on Friday, a high-ranking political change took place in the years when President Vladimir Putin resigned his administration with Commander Sergei Ivanov.
The successor of Ivanov is Anton Vato, 44 years old, Estonian.
He's an ex-diplomate and acted as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from begging for the presidential independent authority for themselves.
According to Kangaspur, it is also possible that Ivanov has been involved in or screwed up with other executives.
Depreciation for Ivanoville
Ivanov, a part of Putin's interior, moves to specific tasks in the environment and transport sectors.
By means of a tape presented by the State Media, Putin said that the change was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another assignment and proposed that he would return, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov this is a clear fall in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia's priorities.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian regime.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor of Putin in 2008, but he became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Researcher Katri Pynjnyniemi of the Institute for Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's location, the fact that Putin is becoming younger in his immediate vicinity.
The Isis warriors used civilians as human shields when they pulled out in Syria, Syria, Syria and Syria.
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Shefan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij military council of Manbij.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters received approximately 90 per cent of the important Manbij city of Daddy's country last week.
However, it is estimated that ten jihadids remained in the city at that time.
Revised the previous news at 7:30: In the past we reported wrongly that civilians were fleeing from the city, actually Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when they fled from the city.
Professor: Professor: The Legal Legal Act of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Interior is unlawfully unlawful.
The Ministry of Interior's guidance on the publication of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The author tells STT that the disclosure of documents cannot be based on the authority's own guidelines, but is based on law.
The Ministry of Interior has previously refused to give up the list of participants in the meetings of the Minister for Interior to the Ilt-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the General Secretariat of the Government's Office and the fact that the information was recorded on the Minister's calendar and not on the accounting records.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic Olympic show starts in Rio.
In the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under valuables.
He'd hurt the beginning of the year and left me with Jamaika's Olympic scars.
This hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been doing well, and that's the key to it, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed pillars dancers and fans of journalists who turned into fans.
On the other hand, there is a sign that the Jamaican star has risen during the period during which universal sport has fought with the doping scandals and the gloating interest.
The last loss of Bolt at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he sprung up in 200-meter primers at 21,05 p.m.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down injuries and loose exercise positions.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began by hundreds of meters, in which he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors during the 9,69 period, despite the end of the world stage.
This is harder than it makes it harder harder.
A year later, in the Berlin World Championships, Bolt achieved his career at the end of his career at the time of his watch.
World record in Berlin is still valid at 9,58 meters and 19,19 ts.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200-meter world record and a 19-second subspace, but no one else believes that it is created but Bolt himself.
On the balance of the Bolt's most challenging challenge is Athens 2004 100th Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing MM final, Bolt hit an American in just one hundred-six seconds.
The Bolt has not lost its worth in the finals in Beijing, for once, if only it has reached its way.
In Daegu 2011 the 100-MM final was left from Bolt to run without running for a wild start.
The store fills up a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the species of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
For the last time, Bolt has set the World Cup in London next year's World Cup.
These are the Olympics that tell me the difference between me and my memory.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the Netherlands, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sport Illustrated interview.
Unreports about Rio: two athletes are suspected of being suspected of doping crimes.
According to Xinhuan, Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Xinyi, 18 has produced a positive doping sample at the Olympics in Rio.
There were traces of prohibited substances found in the Doping screen of the Chinese lady named Chen Xiny.
Also, the Bulgarian drinks Silvia Danekova are suspected of doping crimes.
In addition, the Chinese Public Sports Coach was transported to my home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epi-hormone.
He was located in Rio, fourth in a 100-meter suit for women.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Esdao, the Chinese Ombudsman has taken his case of doping before CAS of the International Court of Appeal for Sport.
Xinhua reports that there were signs of hydrochlorothiazide diuretics in the sample given by Xiny on Sunday.
Other doping concerns have also emerged in Rio.
BBC announced that the Bulgarian women's drinks Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epo-hormon.
On the other hand, Kenya has passed Rio to the home of a public sports coach because of the doping exercise.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee KOK reported that the Chinese coach had developed in the test situation as a athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is a Chinese express coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been in a situation with a 800-meter race pass from the Ferguson Rothh race passport.
Phelps will stop nothing... historic gold came into the display style to the display style.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps swims out of 200 metres in the middle of the 200-metre period, the 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic Games.
At the same time, Phelps reached the first swimming pool of the same species in fourth consecutive races.
The Phelps winning time was 1.54.66.
In Japan, Kosuke Hagino was located in a mixed land, second before China's Wang Shu.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, but Helen Skkelton's Olympics commentator, Helen Skkelton, is laughing at the evening press's quick interview.
The case made on Monday from Helen Skelton is one of the most listed on this week's website in the Official Journal.
Next commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skkelton is not much stressed if soms or British dances have a small cone of his revealing and special costumes.
After all, the television is visual media, and he's stressing it.
Skkelton is dressed in high-ranked shoes and short in a dress that will certainly have at least enough openness to the eyes of at least many conservative Britishists.
However, no back steps are permitted.
It's important to look good, and small trials are just a fun thing.
Skkelton certainly wants to impress you, and maybe he's upset, but he's insisting that he doesn't want to be the lead player.
This isn't about me, he says.
I'm here to watch sports, and the focus should be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I dress up.
Can you imagine that the court's been all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how much these swimmers are doing and how big the sacrifices they're making, is for me, Skkelton cheers me up.
You know what?
It's all about nothing if it comes from wearing (the driver) clothes.
I'm just a little excited if something like this has hit someone's radar.
The Rio's police committed two arrests for terrorist assaults.
The Rio police reported on Thursday that it arrested two people for terrorist attacks.
Police made arrests in connection with the security oversight of the races.
In the same context, the police made five other arrests and interviewed two persons before they were released.
All suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 website, the persons arrested for terrorism are members of the same group that the police had already arrested in July.
The arrested are believed to have connections with the Isis Special Committee.
The arrests were reported to have caused violence in social media.
Messages of violence were distributed, among other things, in the popular WhatsApp service.
The safety of Rio's races is responsible for 85,000 police officers.
The police in Rio blew up a suspicious package in a suspicious package.
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their initial match for Rio's basketball tournament in an empty hall on Thursday.
The police found a suspicious package on the basketball arena and closed the scene to the audience.
The police let the public in after the controlled explosion of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics when the police have performed a controlled explosion mission.
The police shut down the arena because of a suspicious package that was found there.
The audience got in after the police controlledly blew up the package.
The audience did not record the audience by the start of the match, as the police closed the arena for a suspicious package that was found from the lobby.
The police blew up the package and released the audience until after that.
The drink woke up the competitions with a dream of starting the Spanish team.
By two loss races started by Spain won Nigerian points from 96-87.
In the two previous races, Spain reached silver.
The police carried out the controlled explosion mission for the third time during Rio's summer seasons.

Spain and Nigeria started their initial round of Rio's basketball tournament in front of empty viewers.
The Argentina lady fell down on Peitta-Siren - Finnish lady wondered about the protest.
The wind at the Peitta-Siren had a colorful day to race in Rio.
The wind of Peitta-Sire's cake was hard on Thursday.
The Argentina lady fell into Tuuli Peitta-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted the breach.
He got stuck because of the car accident, and the others ran away, Joakim Wilenius, head coach of Finland, told me.
A sportsman was considering a long time of protest.
It was not worth doing so because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should've dropped the water so I could've got a refund, Petja-Siren said.
Finnish hanged on to the last minute because they didn't want to go into Rio's dirty water.
With the accident, a Finnish person stayed left instead of leaving 27.
In the overall situation, London’s 2012 Olympic Championship is eight.
The cholera of suffering did not have much effect on the cholera of suffering.
Friday is an important day when you're going to race from 10 to 12 to 12 Friday.
By way of derogation from the first knowledge, Peitta-Siren did not make any protest.
7 special things, which, according to science, extend their age.
Science has researched everything possible between earth and heaven.
These issues have been proven to bring extra years to the life of a person.
There are some ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
At times, things that a person himself cannot influence may be brought to him for additional years.
These include, among other things, the tendency to medium- body meat or social status.
Regular shopping may take longer than age.
There's always no need to break up - just get enough milk cans.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out many different studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven strange results of the survey.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Beverage of beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against certain cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
The University of Harvard's study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the "lower risk of death", especially in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, on behalf of the alcohol, the studies show that a reasonable use of one of the three daily doses may lead to longer life.
For example, one found that wine drinks lived older than people who didn't drink at all.
Regular use of a toothpaste may extend the life of a person for up to six years, one study explains.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other parts of the body.
The Norwegian survey found out how laughing affected human life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 55,000 people.
Those who laughed more were the most scary people 35 per cent more likely to survive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when gender-based protection is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
In addition, it can also extend age.
Unfortunately, it is not enough just to have sex on its own.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he should also receive orgasm.
Mobility will, of course, bring additional years, it will not be contested.
However, the achievement of a long age does not require absolute socialism.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a big butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with a lower mortality rate.
Whether it was a athlete who got to the Olympics or an actor who won Oscar, he is more likely to live longer than ordinary bulls.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to more years.
Some researchers, once again, suspect that a long age is due to the social status of a person - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to pursue such recognitions as the Nobel Prize.
A survey on the purchasing behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, i.e. probably less than a parent who makes purchases, found that they are more likely to be a parent who makes purchases.
This is because circulation in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has once again been declared to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause death to occur.
So the credit card with your hand on the internet is not the same as that on your computer.
The dark-human railway station in the driveway swept a truck in the direction of a truck.
On Friday night, the Koske, Varsinais-Suomi, had a heavy truck and passenger car ring.
The accident took place at Koskel, Koskeden and Sorvastonet on Friday at 2 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car arrived had run along the same lane, hitting the truck in the right corner of the truck.
The truck was turned upside down after the crash, but it turned on fire.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car was swept away and then passed over its roof.
In 1972, a woman who was born with a passenger car stayed in her car and was crushed.
The rescue facility was removed from the car of the injured driver and transported to Turku University Centre Hospital.
The result of the women's blow test was 2.0 percentages.
He's suspected of a brutal rat-judder.
Mail mail sent a note of scraps to the wrong city to send the wrong city to the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket had deficiencies in the bulk of candy, because the mail had delivered part of the load by accident to the Seinäjoki River.
Teija Haltia, who lives in the family, was on Thursday shopping for scraps from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign got caught in the eyes.
Unfortunately, they have product deficiencies because Posti delivered our loads to the Wall River.
We'll get more when the mail gets the load delivered.
So if you don't run around in a lawn cut, you read the sign.
The sign that we've been shopping for the merchant is that the Posti extended its services last spring to include grass cutting.
The food harvest is served by Post until the end of August.
He said that the village was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The favor of the update hit me off the alarm.
The media representatives have been calling all the time, and the point raised by this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia was over 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got their favorites caught in a bag of broken candy, even though a few sheets were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the management of the transport services of Post Enterprises, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that from the five stage, three were deceiving into the wrong place yesterday (Salo) and we were no longer going to make a partial delivery (Salo) on three, but we were only taking five sets today, Kadesoja told Ilt-Sanom about the evening.
It's the first thing to know about the evening-Sanomas.
Teija Haltia was not upset about the sign because he found all of his favorite kits in the selection.

At that time, he told the newspaper that he wanted to finally get to normal weight, which was 10 kg to go to.
During the three-month period, the number of pounds fell eventually by five.
The hope of a murdered woman’s family in the permit of a murdering woman’s hope: Remembering the victim for police dogs: Remembering the victims for the good of the police dogs.
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovija hopes that the victim should be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute for work at Sipoon Veterinary Station and had also performed his nurse training there.
The vet station remembers her with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work unaffordable.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations may be transferred to.
The update mentions that donations go to police dogs as a whole, primarily to obtain safety tapes.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovinian woman was murdered in her own backyard in the Lovika Kosküla.
The female neighbors have said to the evening paper that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
The 27-year-old man of the murder didn't know a woman and they didn't have any contact with each other.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog, Börje, who was seriously injured in the arrest situation.
But the bike survived, and it's getting better.
The King Court gave Post a judgment on infringement of equality law in respect of an infringement of the equality law.
The mail did not have the right to arrest the salary of a person who refused to apply for a temporary worker, and it was in the judgment in Kanta-Häme.
The right of benefit was imposed on Post to pay the employee most of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the employer's salary corresponding to the entire day's work.
According to the right of treatment, the employee had been placed in a more unfavorable position on the basis of his trade union activity.
The staff member had complied with the PAU’s decision of organisation in the postal and logistics sectors.
During the last November postal strike, PAU issued a decision not to invite Post workers to discuss the infringement of temporary workers.
The matter was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey is to return to a road that respects human human human human rights, to return to Turkey on the road to return to a road that respects human human human rights
Turkey is to return to the path of democratic and human rights- respecting development, written by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his letter earlier, the Journalist Union asked Sipilä and Sonia to express their concerns for Turkey's freedom of expression and the press.
Sipilä and Soini repeatedly inform Turkey of the importance of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.
Putout separated his administration from the head of the head in the state-of-the- hand position of the state-of-the-art Pato Päoto.
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin has been resigned by Sergei Ivanov, President of the President-General, who has been told by the Kml.
The place will be President of the Communist Director-General of the Soviet-Viron Karl Vato's grandson Anton Vato.
Pato is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Board of Presidents since 2012.
The persecution is also due to be a member of the Russian Security Council, and the Interfax News Office tells us about it.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
Ivanov, a member of the close interior of Putin, will, according to Kremlin's information, move to specific tasks in the environment and transport sectors.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed that he would return, as told by Russia Today.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB spying on KGB.
Many considered Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but as President, Dmitri Medvedev rose.
Ivanov was appointed as President in 2011 before Putin’s re-election as President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's jackpot for a game ban will not be seen in the opening of Valioliiga's opening.
The world record man of football transfers does not see the field when the UK Valialiga is kicked into the weekend.
Paul Popban's non- playing ban followed English.
The giant acquisition by Manchester United is because of a game ban on the page ManU opening his league against Bournemth on Sunday, said BBC Friday.
ManU paid Pogbasa to the Italian Society Juventia EUR 105 million, according to the British Media.
However, the FF FF of England keeps him out of the game, because Pogba was left under the responsibility of the Juvenile to ban the game.
He received two warnings from last season at the Italian cup, and it becomes one match of a game ban.
That game ban has been moved to England, FA told BBC about it.
Pogban's next seam to play is the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow's the size of the madness is the virtue of virtue.
The precise criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established the status of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event that is aimed at world top maps.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
The painters have typically expressed themselves in their own personal dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is this year a punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival will be staged with artificial grass and art installation, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a headset and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival held this weekend in the Summer Hall of Helsinki has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to success is a simple question: What kind of event would authors themselves want to go?
It's quite different from what you're saying.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the rules of authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would also be here this year to sell to the end.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors in the last year with 5 000 people.
There are also a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visits is a good thing because things have to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd that will be controlled in the huge highways.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been increased over 13 years in such a way that there are 130 performers, art instincts and numerous restaurants and drinks in a partially artificial grass-frozen area.
In addition to the major and smaller levels of occurrence, this year there are 15 000 people in the area.
Kallio admits that the event could take place more simply than that.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, too, great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki about 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can bring about 'cress stories', like the construction of that 73-meter wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own personal dress.
In addition to the music event, you can talk about the trendy group of young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled into a particular fashion.
Above all, we want to break up with content.
Even so, fashion phenomena match Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists of the main stage is a legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own generation, but he doesn't have the most typical performances of his own.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busy because this is probably the last time this is happening in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's playing on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good and he's been doing some damn good jobs over the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower bags... the tourists fled in fear of their terror.
Hua in Hini blew up a local time on Thursday night two bombs.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower bag and blew up using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose clients are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, said the police representative, Samoer Yoosumran CNN, as the CNN, according to the police representative.
From 1989, the protectionist Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, wrote about your attacks a big picture of the blows.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it from here.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists who were injured in Hua Hin.
The people came running and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar blocks, and she told Emelie Olsson Aftonblad.
The next morning, local time blew up two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket as well as the Finns prefer the island of Phuket.
No one's obviously dead.
At the same time, a second double-bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin that hadn't been able to blow up yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities' estimates, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been involved in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KKML: This part of the new stand-by troops will be launched in a war situation first to fight.
In an acute war situation, backups are ordered to combat only several months after the military light swears, reports Central Finn.
According to Prime Minister Jukka Sonninen, the Head of Defence Forces, who has been interviewed by the Lehden, for example, for 5.5 months of staff serving in military situations, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the training manager, the service is first set up by reserve members of the emergency teams.
No backup or reserve personnel shall be ordered to perform a post without required training, says Sonninen.
In the summer before, it appeared that Defence Forces were about to train the guards to immediately prepare themselves for immediate preparedness services from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used in military operations during emergency staff training, if necessary.
Pamela Tola received a giant earrings from the home house from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a rough fight from the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of two-stored houses had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused health-threatening microbiological growth.
The municipality was forced to sell a dwelling in the form of a landing capacity in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma increased to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the case and asked the seller to pay the price.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the tip and the bet.
The court of court issued the judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It held a judgment in the Court of First Instance which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the trial and settlement of the couple for a total of EUR 47 344.
The court decided a little on the price reduction because some of the need for the repair of the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when they made the sale of housing.
However, according to the court law, the manifestation errors were essentially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola is looking for a nice home.
Tola told me in a long time that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building had been renovated and was in good condition and that there were no harm in the matters mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of sufficient water management for flooding and melting.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear to have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwaters from the rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
In October 2009, trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious than they thought.
The audit carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbiological growth, according to the Witnesses, due to both the rainwater and the capillaryly raised land soils.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, have been estimated to have reached indoor space via the bus as well.
A homeroom, a basement stairs, a living room window counter and a basement washroom was found in the petals of the homeroom, a living room with a living room.
The premises were built without permission.
The court also held a dispute as to whether or not the dwelling was in violation of the extended building permit.
The court held that the Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make changes to the residence authorisation.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no suitable permits yet.
However, the problem with the home was a fundamental matter in court.
According to the court law, the purchasers could expect from the seller, on the basis of the information received prior to the sale, to assume that the building was suitable for living itself and that in the nearest time there was no need for measurable repairs.
In the opinion of the Court of First Instance, Tola and Waroma did not have to carry out a more extensive examination of the usual situation.
The buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the court court shall rule in its judgment.
Rough archive: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to raise children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register.
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article on how microfilm documents have been stored in the National Archives in Maryland, United States, covering a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi mosaics.
The documents and licenses are derived from a breed agency operating in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency served as SS leader under Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been studied by a SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to even more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate the matter.
The breed agency cleared the backgrounds of women by examining church books, among other things.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
The women were also supposed to be willing to give up Swedish citizenship and give the Racial Office a well-defined life cycle and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Office wanted guarantees that women were "children", "saper", and "good nationalists", who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us how 14 Finnish women who found the archives in the documents were found in the file.
The SS Directors set up a state-funded programme known as Lebensbor in 1936.
The programme provided for, among other things, that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, on the pages of the U.S. holocaust Museum.
Instead, the national demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged the marriage by providing loans and support for the provision of children.
A German mother's honorary was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and the non-Aryans were prohibited by law, the museum's pages indicate.
On the 6th of Sire's shadow, Narkko rose and fell.
Tapio Narko was located on the third day of the sailing from the first day of the Finnjollian Day to the Rio Olympics, but remained a total of the crowds for a larvae at the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose in the overall situation after the eighth five leavings, but the failure of the second departures dropped him instead of 14th.

In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in position 19.
Jari Sillapää sattulinna was recorded on a couple of hours' nights, "I was so in a bag".
Jari Sillapää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From a cruise ship's pub to a 1995 tangokin, Finland's best-solded solo artist, and Silapää, who became the star of the dancers and the festival, is still in a huge increase at the moment.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Marippinen, on the life of a favorite singer, was published on Thursday morning.
In the book Silkhead tells about his life and career as good as he does in evil.
The career on the top of the head rose into a total uprising during his victory at the Wall River Tango market in 1995.
In the contest Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopopamaski had written to Sillapää, at the request of a man, a tango piece, which Kasu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
As a result, the piece of satunna rose into one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Silanapap sang it on the tape in a horrific hangover and only after a few hours of night sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in the bag.
The head of the head remembers in the book.
To the contrary, you wouldn't immediately think it was singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically best, the trail was still good.
I learned that all the time, you don't have to insist on yourself being perfect and top right now.
One of the most popular events of a man’s story, about which the book describes, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013 Silanpää resigned from his partner, and the case ended up in the end You also earned a gold piece of text that was published as single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sarah Törmäsäs were not the kind of song that The Head would have liked.
On the other hand, he had imagined that he was making a record telling the truth about his own life, but the words of the song telling the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 day magazine.
In the news, the difference between Jar and the ex-lover was reported as the reason for Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but according to Jar's, it was full of pussy and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari called an angry record company and refused to sing a song, but eventually ended up singing it and so on.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of voters were favoured by the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, although the opinion of the week of the vote would have expected the opposite result.
Britain's economies and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
While a few individual researchers may have disagreed with the current power of their profession, no respected research institute or university has issued a distinction.
The theme 'It's the economy, the stumps', of the former US president Bill Clinton's election campaign, was a scrapped by the British Brexit vote.
Economis were shocked when they didn't hear their voice.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
It's an economic curfew.
The Centre for Macroconomics is responsible for the Brexit disaster in its latest six-month period.
The most typical answer is that no economists were heard and heard, because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the econisms' loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed persons, almost constant then.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many people also have the idea that a decrease in the value of currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the EESC, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the agreement of the economis did not sufficiently come up with the agreement.
In particular, they were driven by the balance of BBC, which gave just as much space to only a few percent of economic scientists from the economimist community who were in favour of the EU gap as an overwhelming majority.
There was no interest in the EU-wide press in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE had to say about the consequences of the distinction between the difference between the EU's power books and the other economic power books.
Those far-off combinations of letters were a face-to-face talk of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the Econists were both listened and understood, they were ignored because the Economis represent an elite with which voters do not have common interests in their own view.
The academics of big cities such as Economis would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also a economy.
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will cause your hospital to incinerate you, the immigrant will use you to save you.
These arguments worked out.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have on the record if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctors if they weren't there?
There are also children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would the real British children get to a school if they got rid of them?
In each municipality, foreigners live in foreign countries.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the econists failed to respond and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
The econisms failed to explain that immigrants make immigrants more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are British government net contributors and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen Property Fund of Aberdeen was prepared for Brexit with cash cash in Brexit.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were responsible for Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen had early reservations at Brexit on the development of plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of a camp in favour of the EU difference, started to be more detailed a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was overdue.
It was a concern that investors would start pulling their funds off the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they might be necessary.
We were going to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily open-air real estate fund that was the news about.
According to the elderly, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the Fund was 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately 20 billion.
It was the highest number of nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained 10% or even below it.
So the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds will close off trading.
When the camp in support of the EU gap won, Europe went a long way.
However, less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney's speech by the Governor of the Central Bank, where he considered that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition to real estate funds, the first, Standard Life, has frozen its trading.
Together, these guys got off the hook and raised the matter to the main sections of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors after one another.
The Aberdeen situation was good because of the collected cash, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually close the deal, but they changed prices down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that, if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it because it would cost you losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of the notifications cancelled.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner European Fund has had no similar droughts.
However, there was a lot of polls.
I unduly undue undue undue attention to real real estate funds's real estate funds's attention to real real estate funds's attention to real estate funds's
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds’ trading became extremely much of the attention of the elderly.
The open funds covered by the closures are managed by approximately four per cent of British real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties of 80 properties of its property in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might hold its funds to the end of 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be "more important" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty that the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen notes.
In addition, a discount rate of 15 % on the market is limited to 30 years, with a discount of 15 % compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
Now, the dollar leader can buy the same property at a lower cost of up to 30 per cent.
There's a lot of fancy buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines to London's real estate market in London.
The situation didn't seem so much like it last night.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, a British real estate fund, responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
Well, that's where you got the power word.
I realized that this was going to go to Plan B's, and Vanhan says in his second home in Helsinki.
She went straight to work.
London City was already completely alive after breakfast.
The normally silent TV lines at the office supported the news, and usually the loud people were silenced to listen completely when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screenheads flashed red and red.
It was the morning that would never have believed he was alive, Old says.
It is not because, despite the mines, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in the United Kingdom, finished two real estate trades on the day following Brexit's vote, i.e. as a train.
The feeling was confused.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was sort of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started at the start of a correction
The storm followed the vote.
It all went down, the British leader went into exchange.
The market was expected to have massive invoices for the real estate market in Britain, in particular in London.
Up to 20% of mines were expected at London's office premises in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the mermaid is down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear to have the last summer holidays this week in Helsinki on Old Town's face.
He thinks it's too early to say a lot about what's going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts, for example, to the situation.
The development of the London real estate market has already gained first information from the development of the London real estate market.
The information provided by CBRE on price developments is about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the deficit increased by 6.1 per cent, and the old man reads.
The figures aren't that terrible, but they're months away.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Oldman.
All the same rises occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall in Lehman and the global economic crisis on the U.S. real estate market.
In the opinion of an old man, the comparison is not quite a good one, as it is now a UK-based crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales such as that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The money is also available normally.
In any case, the repair movement could have been ahead in any case.
In fact, the price correction is not a miracle of him - it could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimates, real estate prices in London and other world cities have been too high for many years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices have been overrated, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started very high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, as have London's population.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last property class that globalizes, Vanhanen says.
New players have come into the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for property investments abroad.
London is a well-known city with an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been increased by low interest rates, for example, pension companies have had to look for returns on new sites.
This loan has been readily available - although Vanhas says that the debt gap is now clearly less used than in the period prior to the 2008 crisis.
Split, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread
In London, the rise in prices went up last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also started to reduce its ownership in London, and it was last year a net salesman.
There was some sort of a turn, and now it came.
What forward forward from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
She's not afraid to judge the future, but she's saying there's hardly any upheaval on her own.
The feeling suggests that there is a calculated or even going ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimism who believes that the dome will be survived by work.
If you are well prepared to take risks, you will be better placed.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one of the markets, there's too much of its victims.
If you've split up, the risks are also decentralised, old man says.
The S-group will begin to register more more information about shopping information.
The S-group knows what you're eating, as the trading company told me today that it is starting to gather more accurate information about the purchases of its clients.
As far as the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will begin to hug it on the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-group is here following Kesko, because the goods purchased on the plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitasta, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used as an authorisation for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economicsnom.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to the change in registration of the S Group.
According to only the purchases of food, Kosko already classifys its client as 10 groups.
The rating shall be updated monthly.
The applicants are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend on them.
The data are used for the targeted marketing of the client.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer support programme and does not have any plans for this purpose.
Finland has its own Yhösbonus customer support programme, which can be associated with the selected houses, SiWok and Euromarkets.
At present, we do not collect product or product group-level data, we maintain a receipt at the level of the total amount.
So we know where the purchase was made and the day before and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as the K-group or the S-group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the programme is intended to be reformed in the future, but it will be discussed later on by the Czech Republic.
However, the Ora does not permit registration of the product information.
In the beginning, experimenting is an initial experiment.
The SOK customer and customer register has so far been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also included occupation, training, housing form, birth years of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role is registered.
The purchase of S-Euth cards has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, place, total purchase and method of payment.
In addition, S-bonus partners’ information is obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will start to be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been looking forward to a more detailed focus on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer and Partner Activities of SOK, Sok.
The S-group says that they are informing their customers about the change they make to their customers.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, data are stored in cats in any case, whether or not they want it or not.
You may want to check the stored data on the S-Group website.
For example, cashiers do not access the information, stress Saikoski.
Video: Heila-kiss is Customs's latest dog confirmation - the plating will become the first explosive dog dog.
The black Labrador driver's puppy strongly grazes five similar boxes set in lines of the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't take long to sit firmly next to the middle drawer.
Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila Dog by playing it with his favorite toy.
The box, next to which Heila sat, revealed a jar of shells occult on the square gas.
The rocket gas is the first smell Heila has been trained with, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila Dog.
Security situation and access to online shopping
Heila is the first dog that specialises in the search for weapons and explosives and is placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila, as the international security situation has changed because of serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
In Customs, the attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures and surveillance, says Mikko Grönberg, the customs inspector.
Another access to the training of weapons and explosives for Customs duties is postal transmissions transiting through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail consignments are transferred annually via the airport, including foreign ordered weapons and explosives.
Over the last few years, customs has made some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives available at Helsinki Airport for purchase of online shopping goods, baggage and air freight from passenger machinery and air freight, as well as for their source materials.
Heila will work all over Helsinki Airport.
It will examine recorded travel goods and mail.
In the future, it will be of great benefit if it can go through large containers and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of their performance, Customs estimates whether more weapons and explosives drivers will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School at the Kingdom Hall
The education of the Heila-pen is coordinated by the Customs Dog School of Customs, which is located in the church district.
The mission will also attend training with Heila to the police and defence personnel.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
They will always be trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
On the Helsinki Airport, colleagues are six drug dogs in Customs, as well as cash and drug dogs Massi.
The Labradorian Heila has been chosen for the ten puppies of a puppy.
The selection criteria for a dog that is selected for the airport include a hole in and a hunting principle, as well as peace because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntion, is a close friend to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go up to Heila from a single sheet.
The security guard in the evening-Samom camera loses a quick camera for a dog's mike shield, but Heila restores the protective shield from a soft toy immediately from the "irti" command.
Work hard competition.
The initial course of the pool will be completed next year.
There are still levels of tests ahead, next in October, when it is estimated that training is sufficient for the required tasks.
They will be able to see their work in Helsinki Airport in the next half of next year, if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come here to iron a dog wearing a working vest, recalls Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year for customs duties.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
The working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active contributions will last only from ten minutes to a few hours.
The owners of the workers are very competitive in Customs.
Heila's owner was looking for approximately 20-30 employees of Customs.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The country's first Olympic medals - the nation's people will have a holiday day.
In rugby, the Olympic Games of under a million people in Fiji, the country is so high that the government has appointed the 22 August national holiday day.
According to the nation's public broadcaster, the Fiji Government confirmed the matter after the end of the championship.
The day after the team returns home the next day.
There are also solemnities for the hero team in their own country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian tells us that the country was followed by the finals in the capital of Suva, where a screen was set for the stadium.
Normally only the Natives of Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game was associated with our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them encouraging, said Maiikele Seru Guardian, editor of Fiji Times.
Dramaa in Rio, Damaa in Rio - the Finnish player fainted after a wild execution.
The presser, Miko Tokola, succeeded in the last attempt to reach 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the cracks, he has been stunned several times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola scored 175 kilos and 145 kilos of force.
His income was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her into the last 175 kilos of her salary, as well as the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of a wild screaming.
The body was suffocated under weight until the judge accepted the lifting.
The delight of the Finnish publisher was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired an Estonian benefiter with Prosan - Veikkausiliiga - Ilta-Sanomat - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing at the football league of men, has concluded a lasting agreement with Albert Prosa, the official beneficiary of the season.
We're looking for a top player in our team that has power and whose threshold to enter Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
Over ten players and I went through a lot of 50 players around the world.
The small-scale group began to be a good alternative to Prosa, coach of RoPS, Juha Malinen, reported on the bulletin.
Prosa, 25, arriving in RoPS from a stable in Flora where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
The Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis meet the ruling master SJK of Finland.
RoPS came to need a new attacker when last year's secular queen Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family Star will once again turn around again: teen-star short shorts reveal almost everything.
With the help of the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphyna became familiar with Ariel Winter will go off again by presenting his proud body again.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minishors, who don't leave much imagination behind.
The shorts revealed not only the actress's legs but also the back of this.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing its style and behaviour significantly more courageous.
The star has scored several tattoos in images published in social media in very small clothes and has taken a large number of tattoos.
Young woman has also seen her dress up in very little costumes.
Winter, who is at the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several photos of himself celebrating himself.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public picture so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from the child star to adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life and he's grown up during the Cardashian era.
He has learned that the more to show the exposed surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and more that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has been stunned by part of his long-term fans with his image shift.
It is not hard to guess where she is in ten years, when the minor is already so hard, says a woman on Winter Instagram.
On the other hand, part of a woman's fans defends an actor and urges to ignore criticism.
You look great.
I don't care what the others say.
You are inspired by many women, by a young woman.
The Japanese want the Nordic countries to prefer to go to Finland - tourists are attracted with a resort: In the autumn it is possible to see a random millor aurora.
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their rest trips, Visit Finland tells us about the information.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese recreational tourism.
Revon lights are the capital cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly linked to the heart stone and snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, there is a very high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of trips to autumn.
It is rare to know that the season starts early in autumn and goes on to spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see so-called millror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the renovation of the vision of two stories of the random, tells in the information document Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Rehabilitation campaign is the rich 25-35-year-old, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by Aalto University and universities of Turku and Tokyo researchers, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the Japanese population compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights from Finland, and according to Lindi, this revival has enormous potential.
The number of nights spent by tourists in Japan has increased considerably more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed more than doubled in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than €80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
Great Britain had to be satisfied with the silver rugby-7 contest when the Fiji Championship won gold.
The great success of the United Great Britain’s seven players in the rugby race broke loose when Fiji won it on Thursday at the Rio's Deodoro stadium, in 43-7 of the finals played at the Rio's Deodoro stadium, in the same number 43-7.
Fiji gave master's teaching in the treatment of the ball, transfers, side-dressings, support game, joggings and raa'a, and won this gold — if it was the first Olympic medal in history for the whole country.
Cutio meant silver, which was slightly thiner for Britain, for it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They may be proud of their success as the Olympics for the first time in the rugby-7 tournament where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong victory of the South African Boss in seven to five semifinals earlier on the same day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, Fidz's team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-year-old team had been in full power.
The fact that at least one British will get a gold medal for tomorrow's neck: Fiji's chief coach, Ben Ryan, former English coach from Wimbledon to rugby-7 team coach.
Experience has been considerable for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, they lost Ryan in training all the games in the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they only lost one game.
The loss is painful, but progress is shocking.
Fiji began finely and introduced its anti-dumping skills to the United Kingdom as if for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his team had run into a group of mobile buses, and the world champions went up 5 to 0 when Osea Kolinisau made a run in the corner.
When it was four minutes ago, Jerry Tawai made another goal on the right side of the goal shot.
The situation was 12-0, and the United Kingdom had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's beautiful jacket prevented the rational Leone Nakarawa from making the third paint, but it didn't slow down Fidz's progress for long.
When the game was played seven minutes, Jasa Veremulu scored the right angle, then the United Kingdom had 17-0 defeats.
Nakarawa made another goal for a further start, when the first half of the game time was still over a minute left.
Vatemo Ravouuou then threw himself through the British team's more powerful plates and ran over the goal line.
After the landing, the opening period ended at the point 29-0.
It seemed that the Fijins were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British still play the role of the learner.
Which is quite true.
The United Kingdom made major changes in half-time and managed to hold down the fidisilian totals for four minutes, which compared with the first half-time was a good performance until Joshua Tuisova scored the Fijin excellent team leader.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the position of 36-7 by making the UK a left-hand corner of paint for the United Kingdom, but the game had long since been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose fans were singing, howling the flags and dancing.
It was difficult not to admire the pure joy of Fiji.
Mata Vilime made a final salad for the Fijiese cake by making the paint in the last few moments.
The bell, the Fijins embrace each other, and the British fell into the field, completely crushed.
In the past day, Fiji had won Japan's semi-final by Chapter 20-5, and the United Kingdom had been bent over South Africa's tight semi-final, where the balance was solved by the British goalline.
Kyle took the South African Biss to lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goalline with his dazzling legwork and hit the bottom of the goal poles in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson, the 15-player rugby team player of England, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
The battle of the coach's cancer against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to fight gold.
A little more emotional than this could have been for these races.
From the first bet to the last Helen Glover and Heather Stanning had 220 winning bets in history and found additional purpose for the golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
Although they were two in the yard, as if the third coach, Robin Williams, who encouraged them to have their second consecutive Olympics in the twins of women, which makes them the first women in the history of British sports, who are at the same achievement.
Their power was undisputed, their victory was already 39th and once more record for them.
What we see is that the two brilliant athletes joining the surface of the water as well as the springs also do not fully reflect the nature of success.
There are a large number of helpful hands behind each row, each of which has contributed to the two-way achievements. However, the most important thing for the contributors is that 30 months ago a cancer was diagnosed and who then did not know whether he would see this day.
According to Williams, the situation was tight at that time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could be cut off.
Without the surgery without the surgery, it would have spread everywhere everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, it would have spread, everywhere,
and the situation would have been pretty bad.
It's a bit of a change of mind."
Williams received a diagnosis in December 2013.
The third was fortunate that Williams was able to begin his treatment outside the season of the species at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if it is now possible to say in such circumstances.
"I needed money, so I had to heal fast.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
That's it.
It's a long way to go, but it's made it a little bigger."
Immediately after the victory, the twin thought was in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning and talked a little more than normal in trying to overcome his own lack of satisfaction.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Armoured Group, who had been behind the Afghan tour, says: "I've been at the sound level this week in ruins, which may be a bit extreme, but that means so much."
"It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we work together with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin's cash have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have hoped for a better person to work with or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition for the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw the charges.
Even at the last 500 metres, when New Zealand and Denmark's twins began approaching, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
"We were very close in a moment.
Helen "Stay with me, stay with me."
It is very important not to drive away."
"We were going well, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We didn't reach the sky today, we just wanted to do a good row and win the race we did."
Two is thinking a year before deciding what to do with their future.
Gover will celebrate next month next month with Steve Backshall, who is familiar with the TV nature programmes.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say that this was my last competition.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"It took about six months after London to find out that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed out.
This time it took about four minutes to figure it out.
This feels so much better," he says.
Iceland will change the current government of Panama leaks.
In October, Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which the protestors of Panama's data leaks are calling for in spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that many Irish politicians have taxed around taxes and tax havens with the help of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protestors.
At that time, his successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analyses, it is difficult to predict how much public rage will have an impact on the fall's election results.
During the June presidential elections, the criticism of the rulings was clearly visible, and the president was elected the Gudni Johannesson, who stood outside the policy.
Trump said that he was sar sarstical when he claimed to be the founder founder of Obama Isis Isis, Obama.
Donald Trump, president of the Republican President-in-Office of the United States of America, cancelled his latest convenings.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and democratic candidate for Isisi, Hillary Clinton, who was part of the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was upset by the speeches and asked for an apology from the Trump.
The Commander of the Army should never let anyone who can fall about that down, your Clinton quote.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a musli-pocalypse to cover the interests of the Muslims in the bathing areas, including the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that coastal and bathing are prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and respect for seasonal swimwear.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder of order in France, which has been the cause of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove France to a party on the anniversary of the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extreme organizations, linked to Isa, attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu Region passed through the sile - sealing acceleration at Pyykösjär lake.
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the region of Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the lake of Pyykös Lake has a blue-flying seam.
During the Tuesday and mid-week period, environmental measures in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other common bathing areas.
Except for the sea coast, the levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococ bacteria in all bathing waters were below the operating limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
Sea bathing water concentrations of E. coli and enterococ were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the limits of the action.
The blue-stamped sea basin does not yet make the water ineligible, but under favourable conditions the situation may quickly change into a blue-stamp flower, making the surface of a blue-stamped resting plant.
The environmental measures will follow the situation through enhanced inspections.
In the event of a change in the level of sealing, the information shall be provided separately on the bathing area notification form.

The MKK's Yõhärinen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside the outside of forest owners outside the outside of forest owners are more than 80% 80% 80% more than 80% of forest owners.
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The income tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the basis of the generation of forest space.
At the Ministry of Finance's presentation, forest fund reduction has four objectives: promoting the generation of forest farms, the age structure of forest owners, increasing forest size and increasing the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The hunter would reduce the net income of the forestry economy.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is good, commenting on the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK) Forestry Director Juha Hakkainen.
However, it is likely that you will find a critical part of the tax reform proposal.
The reduction in the forest gift is presented as a function of the clean income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
In the opinion of the MKK and Jõhäinen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the result of the sale of wood.
The VM's proposal is to start by making a reduction in the net income of the forestry economy by preventing the loss of the income of the forestry economy, which should be deducted from other taxes.
A person would get a tax benefit, even if he doesn't have to do it.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owners are unable to visualize it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model concerns only a small part of the forest owners.
The limit for the reduction in the value of forest returns is set at EUR 40 000.
It's drawn to the Yõhrainen's opinion that it's too high.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are removed from the circle of the deduction.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest management division, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the holding.
Forest policy forest gifts have been reduced by many decades according to Hajärinen.
There is a background for the ageing of the forest management and the ageing population.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful box of steel surprised drivers with Himmanga, two cars seded into a row and ran into each other and met each other.
There was a special attack on Himanga in Kalajoen on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutive driving cars were swept down in a row, followed by a run ahead of us.
According to President Harri Pyyhär of the Sun-friend's firemaster, the disengagement is suspected of being led by a powerful brutality.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital for medical treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that ran above did not get hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway from 8 Himanga to a few kilometers to the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
Recent research results from the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings from the research group of Academic Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the incidence of cancer.
Many tissues, such as the chest, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in a normal way in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, growth in cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells in addition to cancer cells between cells and surrounding tissue.
The results have been published on 4 August in the Nature Communications magazine, which has been evaluated in the field of cell biology.
The suit of family family home death is still in court, the prosecutor's prosecutor is also asking for a murder sentence for another author.
The dress of the female’s death rate continues to be courted for both of the condemned.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for the death of a family home with a Musketeer.
The second received 8 years 4 months from, among other things, the murder of a young person and the brutal robbery.
The second sentence is a 12-year imprisonment for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The death was also sentenced to a serious threat to road safety as a young person and to the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, lawyers and a man who was more strongly convicted of the judgment of the Court of Appeal appealed to the Court of Justice.
The D.A. requires a less punished man to be convicted of murder as a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
At the time of their act they were in full understanding.
Under the sovereignty of the 17-year-old youngsters killed as director of the child care unit of the school home, working last July of last year.
The 17-year-old, who was murdered, attacked the director who was sitting on the living room couch on the grounds of the judgment.
The director had been able to get out of his grip and put a young man into his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a urinal tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental investigation, both condemned were fully understood at the time when they were committed.
The right is that young people had planned to escape family homes at least from the day before.
The ice ice fish is the world's most long-life backbone is the most long- age vertiti age, and it is only growing at 15.6 age age age age and at age age age.
The world’s largest live vertebrate is a confirmed icefish, reports the research published in Science magazine.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, like ice-cream floating around Greenland, the vault can live up to 400 years old.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
More than a lifetime is the fact that it only grows a centimeters a year.
Only one species is known to be longer than one live ice cream.
The investigators found out age with radio communication.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residue.
Based on that, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
An older person was estimated to have 392 years of age - although throwing in the direction or in the other direction may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump Economics - News of the People's News
Donald Trump America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the total tax revenues of the State would not be taxed if the change in the tax on corporate tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, through the most profitable tax cuts.
Trump described it as a revolutionary in his tax programme during his presentation on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting, there would be a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year.
The excess income tax rate is now 39,6, after a reduction in the Trump rate of 33.
They'd give up all of their basic taxes.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The resulting environmental standards must be reintroduced and energy regulations removed.
The health reform of Barack Obama has to be re-readed.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the "harmed" trade policy is one of the major causes of US problems.
The Free Trade Agreements would be deleted.
Imports from China would be subject to 45 % and Mexico would be subject to a 35 % penalty rate.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globalisation, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America does not have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will join cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new clouds all over the country.
By contrast, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economimists, including those close to Republicans, are seeing the Trump program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday, Finnish time.
An attack on the past - News of the People's News
The sea's fatally landing, but the real attack wave is hitting in the middle of Madrid's roof - the accounting can begin with the past.
That's where Pedro Almodóvar's story was all about it.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travelers (2013) was a small-scale and train-looking satirical comedy, the pre-skin skin where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish careers.
In principle, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a suitable, seasonal love, relationship and family drama, with a mother-daughter relationship with a daughter at the heart of it.
It's a simple story and we'll see a lot of things as a long setback.
Life seems to be like a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall apart.
A new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) in the last games of random encounters can be a miracle ever since the end of the movie.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once made her life for her adult daughter.
He begins with the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
On the other hand, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, a TV-accurated from the series Ommelten time (2013).
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered a cough, but I would say myself that it's rather strange and literal by unscatheding.
Almodóvar movies often have a fair distance to such a characteristic whirlwind, always with a sense of humor.
It's a flat-screened, controlled, place where there's good music, and it's a rather sad film, where it's made up of ingredients for the gesture.
On the other hand, the visual color sensitivity typical of the Spanish director is preserved and so that it begins to inject a little bit of silence into the eye in a more pure shape than a functional dramaal moderation.
Diseases, deaths, or otherwise sudden loss of life, but the surface remains one of the Koreans.
This applies in particular to the claim: in the case of a person named, the residences change from one scene to another, and the same applies to the exact earrings to be displayed.
Almodóvar is specific in these matters, but the main issue, i.e., the viruses of the current scene, is not more specific than this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly lifeless.
Almodóvar has written the script on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Canadian Alice Munro, awarded in Nobel in 2013.
Novell has been published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has been involved in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced written literature filming.
The topics would have been an emotionally more eccentric drama, much of a great deal - especially a terrible guilt - film about the subject.
Instructions and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Major: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the movie is on August 1st, 8th.
The government is trying to try the election show - People's News News
No new cuts are being made, the cooling ministers, so that the basic Finns don't completely collapse.
In the spring, however, the surgery will be performed by a kidnapping shop.
No new surgery.
The savings of four billion have already been made sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium.) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (kok.) under the budgetary line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring frame rule.
Child welfare, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment benefit as a result will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
Gloves, mittens and mitts
Why do ministers so much stress that there is no further cuts on these issues?
The following year shall be the calendar year.
The gymnasts are held in April, and they are the most important heat meter of the parliamentary term, not the galulators.
In the past, it has been seen that the result of the local election in various directions of the Governments has been ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallupits report that the Government Party's basic Finns expect a hive loss, although the result of its previous election was modest by 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the primary Finns received 752 new mandates, of which the cost of influence in the rule of law is realised to a large majority in the next spring.
The course of life of the government of about three equally large parties is in case the position of the Basic Finns endures.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the voters voted for the need for government policy during the first year.
The first characters of the parliamentary group's visits have also reached the surface.
First of all, the fact that next year, they will be carried out violently and, secondly, they will try to calm down the attack on basic Finns.
Major surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set the goal of reliance on debt during this parliamentary term, but next year, the proposal for the budget of Petter Orpo will take EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the settlements, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is neither able nor even slowed down.
The other one's got to stick to the program.
It will mean more severe operations on the previous one in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be a close balance during 2018 and then the spring will be adopted in Parliamentary elections as to what will happen.
With these measures, debt debt is not expected to be credited.
It is quite clear that current measures on debt do not make sense, even though Juha Sipilä how to try to relieve the positive mood.
The curves presented by the Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen at the information conference of the budget testify against it:
The growth forecasts of the global economy have repeatedly proved to be over-optimal, i.e. help from the international economy is not going to happen.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over this decade and has prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment is now costing EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
General government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-term of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief proposed by the Left Party was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year the maintenance of unemployment will cost approximately EUR 6 billion, which will be fully covered by a new debt.
This is the understanding of the responsibility of the Centre, the Meeting and the Basic Finns.
Question: The municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks to do.
Three out of four considers that the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise of children is the responsibility of the municipality, shows the research of the KAKS-kunlllisalas Development Foundation.
A large majority of the people also assume responsibility for individual municipalities from libraries, culture, citizenship, building supervision, higher education and waste management.
The responsibility for the county is more clearly sought by the county, special medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institution care for developing disabled people.
None of the tasks of local governments under the responsibility of order is to be transferred to the State.
A long, long-lasted railway driver ran behind and ended a chase to get the police out of the way.

The police department was trying to stop without a bright driving bike, but a young man left to drive the police along with fair speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonjajan coast from which the Sorronahon road and the lower forest road where the motorcycle ran out of the way.
After this, a young man ran away, but a faster-footed cop ran off to the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 percentages.
He also did not have a driving licence that would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.

The blast flow caused massive damage to the environment, which has been poured out by the tents of the Parafest Festivals.
Arthur Pippuri, president of the Joensuu Parapolar Association, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its financial legs, and the event can be organised next year as well.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with presentations held at the theatre's premises from 13 a.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15 a.m.
The programme is planned to be planned.
The burst flow is generated in a cloud of thunder when rainwater and its weight are triggered by a falling air flow.
Changes in the weather conditions of a cloud cloud are bound by heat and therefore the decline in air mass is cooling and its speed toward the earth is accelerated.
The Air Science Institute reports that current currents occur in Finland several times during summertime.
It's hard to predict the route of efficiencies.
The flash flow struck the location of Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m. on the back of the Joensuu Art Museum.
Three tents fell off, a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, there were only four people who were slightly injured by the accident.
There was one child in this group who was transported slightly injured to further treatment.
Air pollutions are ageing in the lononians.
According to the study, the skin of the lonhos grows faster than normal.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study reports Eventing Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people aged two and a half years older than that of elderly people living in rural areas is two and a half years old.
The skin of the ageing small particles is a very good dust rate, which is derived from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which according to the Event Standard, are nearly 9 500 people per year die from respiratory diseases.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cacin's investigation found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who travel on their way to the vicinity of congested streets.
London’s residents may try to protect themselves from atmospheric pollution, for example in various masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended for a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes failed a man standing in front of your a man standing before your head.

Beach Volley Artist Ess Hasun's circle closes to Kouvola - SM is missing from the prize cup.
Essi Hasu is about to stop playing the Beach Volley game, at least temporarily after the current period.
The Finnish Championships will be settled during the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played in the series of both adults and young people.
The six best pairs of each series of ratings are eligible for the SM final tournament organised by the Kouvola Aeroballers and the Finnish Aeroball Association.
The local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's breeder Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish Beach Volley caps for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
If possible, as many as possible can be reached at the reception hall this weekend.
I'm sure that Pesisstadion will have a great way to go.
I haven't played very often in the adult series in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home angles, the stinking mood.
Kouvola's neighborhood lit Hasu's spark of a sport and gave good lunch for a fine hobby.
There are good memories of a child.
I started the balloon when I was nine in Elimäe NMKY's E-girls.
The main point is in the sense too big a game shirt, knee protectors in the ankles, as well as great contusions and choreographers after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small local location, the sports club was a community where everyone knew each other.
The group's spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
The families of all the families were very active - the father of the teammate trained us and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
The Essi Hasule beach volley was already a natural species choice to counterweight the internal flight ball during the train season.
In the 1990s, there's been a game of music on the swimming pool of our village since the 1990s.
The operation has always been active.
I also went to watch the SM event of the Juniors, thinking that one day I'd be playing there myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu is playing in the weekend together with Aniina Parkkinen in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtkkonen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked twin goal of the tournament is clear.
A realistic goal is for us to have a medal.
SM-cult is still missing from the prize hat, it's a mystery to throw away.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be Hasulle in front of the last known audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work are expected.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallion tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the toes will be placed on the nail, Hasu will plan it.

Sal Solomon’s Koli of Solomon’s Koli went bravely to become a farmer of agricultural farmers.
Agriculture as an enterprise means risk mitigation, sweat and strength.
Young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25 became a farmer because he believes a positive future also in rural areas.
The move began shortly two years ago with his little brother, Valtter Kol, to continue working with their household.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with his experience.
Starting as a rural enterprise was a debt and an increase in volume so that bread could get hand for agriculture.
It's been since I was a little boy, it's been my thing.
I've always been happy with the farm, and now that I started working as an entrepreneur, I've put everything into the game.
If something starts up, I think it'll have to be serious and real.
In 2013, we went to build a driveway, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I was very bravely involved in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, the Koli of Solomon tells me and adds that it would not have been done if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good for him.
Salomon Kol's goal is to invest in even bigger nails.
The work has produced results, for Solomon Koli has been chosen as the 10 best groups in the competition of young food producers in the Rural Future magazine.
At the moment, he's competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.

Snachatin anime- effect is criticiseded as Asian caricytype.
Snapchat says that this filter inspired anime, but some observers think it's racist.
With the Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity ways that bring them closer to absurdity.
You can turn yourself into ananax, dog or character in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
The lenses are unfurnished, features of distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfie per day.
All illusions quickly enter into public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been given a review of where it has been charged with favouring blackface or bleached skin symptoms as a beauty acquisition.
So when it offered to some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes to pieces, distorted their teeth and made the top of their cheeks bubbles, part of the critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yelllowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts were referring to a major problem that the company has with diversity.
News and rage spread widely on Wednesday and wrote about it, among other things, the genders The Verge and Motherboard Day after Snapchat reported that he had removed the filter.
The company explained: the lens was meant for honor to anime characters, not the caricature of Asian people.
But observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some were quick to argue with an anime comparison.
In her e-mail, Korean American art student Grace Spapani, whose Twitite images were widely shared, said that the lens was "at least offensive and awkward".
He adds: "It is difficult to deny the parallel of a very delicious Asian caricature to filter performances.
It shows that the filter isn't just a "yellowface" but is something that has been taken to a despised extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it seems that there is an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion always from corporate governments to Hollywood and equipment that we carry with us.
The public of Snachat is composed of young people who are more ethnically diverse than their parents' responses. This may mean that they are likely to expect even more discretion.
"When one of Snachat's lenses creates a picture that offends the user, these types of things are no longer very easily missed, as previously said," said a 25-year-old Katie Zhu interview on Thursday.
Zhu, working as the product manager and designer of the Medium release platform, decided on Thursday to remove its Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his media article and phone interview, he said he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation of diversity in Snapchat's recruitment practices.
Zhu criticises the business's mostly white leadership, which consists only of men, and decided to write on the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either their unilateral staff that does not have colorful people when they can make such decisions, or they also have color for workers, but their status is not such that they dare to express their views directly and easily" says the Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snachat has largely failed to reply to the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, considering its position as a private company.
Thursday Snachat refused to discuss the ethnic backgrounds of his staff, but according to its editor, the company has recently hired a recruiter to focus on vulnerable groups of people and the promotion of inclusion within the company.
For its part, Zhu says that he is keeping his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
According to Congress's Expert Group, military officers, according to Congress's expert team, the intelligence information about Isaac was distorted by the military officers.
The Congress Expert Group published a report on Thursday that US armed forces, Central Command, changed intelligence reports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isisi in Iraq and Syria than what happened in the field.
The Republican presidents of the Committee on Representatives of the United States of America (House Armed Services Committee) for intelligence and defence appropriations set up a working group to report on the "general dissatisfaction" of armed intelligence missions.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the US military forces located in the State of Florida, Tampa, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence records accepted by the senior management of Centcom gave a more positive picture of the US counter-terrorism actions in general than the facts indicated in the field, and were exceptionally more positive than in the analysis of other intelligence units", let us refer to the press release on the report.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable – our soldiers are suffering when false analyses are presented to high-level political leaders," says California Republicman Ken Calvert.
"The errors in Centcom's management reach the highest level of the organization."
A 10-page report details in detail the continuing problems encountered in 2014 and 2015, which are described in the Central Command's descriptions and analyses of American activities for the training of Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by Obama's administrative authorities were faked, it gives an analytical picture of the fact that Centcom's leaders would have pushed them to present a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command press releases, statements and statements of the Congress were considerably more positive than the events actually were," says the report.
"For example, the Centcom official issued a public statement stating that a large military campaign for the return of Mosul could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under Isisi's control.
"After months of research, this is very clear", says Mike Pompeo, Republican Representative of Kansas.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, high-ranking intelligence leaders of the US military's highest-ranking forces were manipulating the received intelligence to reduce the risk of Isis's threats in Iraq."
The Republicans set up a working group once they learned of the doubts put forward by the analysts about the manipulation of intelligence on the Daddys.
The report published on Thursday will follow more detailed results, as the studies will continue.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence intelligence.
On Thursday, democratic members of the Committee responsible for Question in the House published their results, which were partly in agreement with the conclusions of the Republican Bureau.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom has created an over-limited process for assessing the intelligence of Isisi and Iraqi security forces", says Adam B. Schiff, Committee High Representative.
According to Schiff, this process "suspected the publication of intelligence results, "damaged the morals of analysts", and "sponsible dissorbed views".
However, according to the Schif and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to press the Centcom analysts to adjust its conclusions to "an established or political official line".
The news site Daily Beat reported on Tuesday the preliminary findings of the Congress's study.
In August, New York Times told me about the Pentagon reviewer's investigation, which started as a result of the complaints made by Centcom's analysts.
The Pentagon editor, Lieutenant-Capporteur Patrick Evans, in his notice, says that the Ministry of Defence does not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation of the Superintendent is ongoing.
However, he says: "The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has further consequences, apart from the fact that it seeks to determine whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by more than one defence authority).
However, the arguments put forward last year raised the question of how much President Obama can rely on Central Command and give an honest assessment of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism of social intelligence is in line with the differences that occurred more than a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that stated that the government of President George W. Bush, despite the objections of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and took little time to consider what would be the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on Personal Intelligence information.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker task force concluded that, despite opposing public statements, air strikes on refineries by Isis had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group since it had built temporary refineries and was able to sell oil in the black market.
However, the outcome of the investigation was not covered by the Central Command, reports The Times in September.
Centcom's commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was therefore critical of the last year after many legislators had assessed the Senate's statements of testimony as too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
The United States will win the fourth duel in women's country of the country, and the United States will consolidate its position to settle their position with the United Kingdom.
After putting three goals in a win-win game, paint 6-1 solved game against Japan Katie Bam made the first two goals for the U.S. women's country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure whether he had previously succeeded in the same way.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who keep a number of paintings they do."
However, he knows: Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and have lost zero games and are sharing their group first with the UK, which continued its winning cycle on Thursday, January 2 to 0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will play the opposite of Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams survived the final match, which will determine which of them will be the first and the second of the six teams.
First, to avoid a longer period of encounter with a tough Dutch team that won a second chapter.
Despite what happens on Saturday, the Americans have already raised their surprise success in these races four years after it has been the last of 12 teams in the Olympic Games in London.
Bam was in a team in London, too.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took his country country country for the first time when he was only three years old (his older twins played the species in Drexel).
The Olympic Games in 2008 missed him when he failed to make it to the final table of players.
After this, 2012 competitions came, where he and his team did not have much success.
The following year the English coach was appointed Craig Parnham, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our work in London was not like it is now.
We have made a complete translation."
On Thursday night Bam opened the goal during the first half of the day by hitting the ball from close to the ball in with a banging-in.
India had entered the game without any tournament victory, but it proved to be a surprising hard opponent and kept the 1-0 situation up to the third period, when Bam stepped on the field.
Bam carried the ball along the left side of the field for a long time, rolled to the middle, hit the ball in the finish line, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first game in which the United States goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had sunk in each one hit.
Briggs is now living for his success period,
same as Bam.
"Our facility is good now", says Parnham, but how good is it, it depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
In the middle of the Olympic Hull, trampoline brings the music to the music.
Regardless of the time and time, the Olympics will have to run into each other without delay.
The events, competitions and struggles of Rio de Janeiro seem to be the next intense message constantly and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympics itself were a flaming communion that goes from a bow to a swimmer, a swimmer to a gymnast and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in a coffee shop without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Closes.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The first time in the Olympics, Dooley's charm with a smile and might well be the name on everyone's lips that would appear and belong to the best of watching and listening times, would be the favorite of sponsors and would be a good mind in TV commercials, if he were just a swimmer, gymnastics or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28 from California Lake Forest, competes at the Olympic Cute Trampoliin.
The Olympic wind does not reflect all competitions equally.
Far from the center, partly in the shadow are less well-known sports species, such as aerial amber, aerial amber, a sealball and taekwondo.
We'll always have a bra, and let the championship stay here for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own special favor, I would like to draw attention to the admirable appeal of trampoliin.
Although trampoline has been the Olympics since the 2000 Sydney Competitions, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many people I've been interviewing didn't even know it was the Olympics.
Inaccuracies can be territorially per se.
Of course, the United States has been involved in athletes at the Olympictrampoline, but the country has never reached medals and has never gone to the finals before in 2012.
In men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and women's side of the medals are both Canadians.
China Dong and Canada Rosie MacLennan are defending gold medals this year which they won in London.
However, Trampoliin has the charm of the defendant, partly because an uncivilized replacement sounds more appropriate to the circus school than to the Olympics.
(I feel in this context that I am no expert, only an ordinary fan.)
The species has its potential, which has been used in drawing screens for endless populace attacks on characters. But it also has the same dignity as in gymnastics and swimming pools, i.e. species that are inherently combined in trampolitins.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, meaning "pulp board".
Fascinating champions jump with huge trampolitins, which burns them to a height of nearly 10 meters. Before landing, the jumpers must make a series of acrobatic movements such as circles, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, the jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, severity and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes who come from 17 different countries compete for the championship of trampoline power, with 16 men and 16 women.
The trend of the most common Olympics is direct forwards.
In the pursuit of gold, the scales need to get further, faster, up and above, sometimes over the finish line, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the paint line or source wall, they also have another objective to which they are pursuing on television reporters, namely the World or Olympic show.
This determined pursuit is noble, appealing, even fanatic — and even enough to get the viewer to tears.
But this, too, I find it a little exhausting just to watch the races.
This trampoline offers a breath.
There's a way up in the Trampolis.
The aim is not to move forward.
The gymnast turns up weightlessly like an astronaut, falls down and shuts down to get back up.
Of course, there is also a competitive aspect, and it is not easy, but it does not involve an intense rush to paint or jump far, only a dreamy and smooth combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to a Zen as only an Olympic contest can get.
Women's scratch matches and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and will begin at 13.00 local time and men's similar races on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will send finals as part of the afternoon’s broadcast, starting at 14.00 local time on either day.
In the midst of the Olympics, there is a calm and wonderful moment that may be missed in the midst of a common hulking.
And if the awareness can only be increased by providing attractive male athletes and by objectizing them – as the American male fighters Wall Street Journal recently suggested – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fan group to be appalled.
A whole generation protested at Ethiopia, a long-term American ally.
Vi violent demonstrations in Ethiopia violent protests in Ethiopia violent protests in Ethiopia.
Government forces have broken up protests that require political change throughout Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protestors have been shot to death in liaison with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African countries and a reliable Western ally whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, over recent months, countries have shaken anti-governmental demonstrations that are becoming increasingly widespread in the wider regions.
It was only last week that thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding profound political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was pathetic.
According to the witnesses, the police shot and killed several non-armed protesters.
Some demonstrations are expected to be in the videos described at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year to show how security forces are hitting young people who have been forced to stand up against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep the country united, and it is even more difficult to move forward", says Rashid Abdi, research director of the international crisis group of the African Sarvi project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, whose stability has been promoted by the Western countries.
The United States Army and Intelligence Service are closely supporting the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorism throughout the region, in particular in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, will receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital of Addis Ababa has even a new orienteered train in Addis Ababa.
The streets of the cities are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model of democracy: human rights organisations have consistently reported government repression policies, opposition country is very limited, and the dissidents are rapidly being silenced.
Many people have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far away to the wilderness.
But the situation may change.
"If the people are suppressed, and it has no other option but to show their minds, it will be disengaged", says Seyom Teshome, the university's barter at Central Ethiopia, says.
"The whole body of the body is pointing to its mind.
A whole generation protested."
There are many grounds for dissatisfaction, always using the land from the power of the governing council.
In the past year, the ruling party, and its allies, have received a place that previously belonged to the opposition, resulting in which they now govern the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions grow on the Eritrean border, where the situation in which the exhilarated situation required hundreds of deaths in the fight in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less fallen separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden People's Liberation Front, may try to exploit confusion and re-arrange themselves.
For those reasons, the bitter mind that has been cut off for years now has many reasons.
The first is obvious innocent: smartphones.
Only over the last few years, Ethiopians have been able to send messages in social media when the most affordable smartphone became common and Internet access improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many people can access the Internet via mediation servers that hide their place of residence.
Many Ethiopian youths said that this was how they called people for demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations of Ethiopia, oroms and Amphas.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
The Amhars, mainly from Christendom, have long been governing the country's politics and business and extremism, a large proportion of which are Muslims and live in sub-regions.
But this too is changing.
"Cooperation is getting deeper and we're getting under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director Mulatu Gemechu.
The main demonstrations have just been in the Oromo and Amhara areas.
Many Amharas and Oroms feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by the tigran tribe, which represents only about six percent of the population and, however, controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause behind the problems is Meles Zenawin's death.
Former Vice-President Meles was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a disease not mentioned during 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind a corner.
According to the analysts, he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of discontent and using ambassadors who made arrangements for the interests of the counterparties.
"The present government lacks this essential instinct," says conflict investigator Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hallemariam Desalegn entered Meles' boots from almost unknownness.
Unlike Meles, who was from the region of Tigre, North Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to the analysts, he has no confidence in the security forces administered by the tiger tribe.
Many people fear this to mean more bleeding.
The last time in Ethiopia, similar riots were held in 2005, when thousands of people came to their minds against the elections that the government, according to the analysts, first suffocated and then stole.
Although many protesters were killed in post-election problems, the number of deaths was less than in the previous months, and the number of deaths was relatively rapid.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders on long-term infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train, and significant progress towards combating poverty.
But the inner grudge against the Ethiopian Government has obviously not prevented the power from being strengthened.
And the well is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
In the last month, the protestors at Gondar attacked the companies owned by the tigers, and the hate speech against the tigers is becoming more widespread in social media.
Analysts suggest that protests put the United States and other Western allies in a state of distress.
The US Government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring Somalia-to-air aircraft, but according to the United States, the base is recently closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its ally in an unstable region to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was a sar sar sar sarsticist when he claims to be the founder founder of Obama's father's father's father.
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to pull back his words in his latest campaign in a row, claiming that he was not serious about his argument several times this week by President Obama and Mr Hillary Clinton's terrorist group Isis as "founders".
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican about the ability of the presidential candidate to send a clear signal to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidates in these stormy moments and explain the comments he may not have meant.
Trump submitted the argument at the election meeting on Wednesday night and repeated various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that President and Hillary Clinton created Daddy.
However, early on Friday morning Trump did twiit and said that his claim was sarcasm.
The Trump totally fainted at the Twiit from the last day when he said in several interviews that he had been indicted for quite seriously.
When the radio drinker and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump to ease their claim by saying that Obama was trying to destroy Isisi, the President of the Republic, who refused to withdraw his claim.
The latest review storm came when Trump tried to concentrate his campaign back on the economy when the figures were down.
Trump and Clinton kept their economic policy lines in Michigan this week.
Friday Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes and found Clinton's speech boring.
Trump's been defending himself in the sarcasm before.
At the end of July he received extensive criticism when he seemed to call on the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email. Later he explained his comments by saying: "Of course I was sarcastic."
This way Trump will stretch the boundaries of political speech and draw words back if necessary.
"I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that give rise to a response to his supporters. He considers how supporters react to messages and "clears" in a way or a different way depending on the reactions", says communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has observed the language used by both presidents.
"But I also believe that he understands his claim and knows that they are circumcise enough to pass through different sides."
Instead of making Trump's statements softer for the election audience, in recent days, he has changed his style even further than ever since his support figures have continued to decline.
The new opinion by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist published on Friday revealed that Trump's support is considerably lower than Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is very smooth.
While Trump usually tries not to apologize for his provocative speeches, he often blames his critics for misinterrupting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming more precise in mind, the presidential campaign over the last few months, Trump's jokes have put his loyal supporters into an awkward position in which they will publicly defend Trump's comments as much as they are provocative as possible.
One of the most important supporters of the Trump, the former mayor of New York Rudolph W. Giuliaani strongly defended the presidential candidate during the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I consider his words to be justified, as a political speech," Giuliani replied when he was asked whether Trump was truthful in claiming that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Isisi.
"That is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization which Obama called "a team of the lower series", and that's why it happened because he pulled the troops away from Iraq."
The most powerful Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was a foreign minister, allowed Isisi to continue its efforts when it did not take decisive action in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, where he accused them of defamation and discriminatory attitude towards him.
He mocked the "inadequate and pathetic" television commentators who try to find out about him, but he said that he could not succeed in it.
Some Democrats mocked the Trump's explanation and said it was simply a more clear indication that he was not fit for presidentship.
Due to the rise in excessive rent, the closed coffee shop opened in Greenpoint at Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a slightly explosive cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash went to the payment instrument and there was no Wi-Fi, but who offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the cafe was charged out of its street shelters on Bedford Avenue when the rent rose to an unreasonable price.
Verb Cafen replaced the summer 2014 became Soap Cherie, who sells pasta cake-shaped soaps.
Locals consider this to be under mid-classification to avoid the loss of a lost coffee shop to be miserable.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is changing, I know, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club is gone, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But even though New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one.
In November last, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, just about a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee has Wi-Fi and can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same, and the atmosphere is still not sophisticated.
The coffee's still good.
The owner and head of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there all the way to the end.
When one customer offered to finance the opening of a new coffee shop, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Web space the bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressophone model as before.
In addition, it reintroduced even the old Verbi lamps.
Rodriguez says that, however, he wanted to try something new and try something new, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
added to the list of new products.
There are pecon eggs and cheese-sandwichets and, in order to fill the capers and browned onion rings.
The list also includes tummar people.
No more beer from coffee, but instead of juices made from fresh fruit.
After having kept the coffee for nine months, Rodriguez says that he discovered that the old standard customers began to enter Verb for a steady flow.
"A lot of our old clients were charged out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who went to a cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
After changing to Greenpoint, he made walking trips to the Verbi, which was still in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai treat instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also a listing novel.
A second long-term client, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithful to Verb since 2003 and has been in London since 2003.
He used to go to a coffee shop before work, and he ordered the same thing without exception.
"I walked into a coffee shop every day over seven like a machine, and there they already prepared my babobages with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez wanted to try something new and bring new products to his menu.
Today Rosenthal still holds his standard product, but sometimes he varies from bagels to bacon, egg and cheese fills.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge about the soap shop taking the old place.
Soap Cherie's owners were even offered to make a special sandwich, which is used for the manufacture of Webbi's own cold-frozen coffee.
"We can still take the offer," says Rodriguez.
Polish people who traditionally lived in Greenpoint have also received coffee with joy.
One of the new clients turned the menu into a half, and Rodriguez is now telling us that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought with it other interests.
The local juice company wants to bottle and sell coffee in the coffee shop cold-frozen.
The coffee may also expand into the next building.
For many customers, however, it is enough for them to get their old favorites from the new Network.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the coffee shop was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered coffee there, it felt like I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I got the smell of coffee."
The poor food for the great recession in the new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in his office room in the White House for lunch.
As a culturalist, President Roosevelt was pleased with the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the Hanh Meadow Manor and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day, his menu was more modest: devil's eggs (deviled eggs) in tomato sauce, potatoes, and dessert from the bonefly.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people suffering," says Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, adds: "It was also a message for the Americans how they should eat."
Each couple in Brooklyn Heights works as a food historian.
Coen's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells of the Chinese kitchen in America, while Ziegelman's latest book, called 97 Orchard, tells a story about the story of the story of the floor in the town of Lower East Side.
Their new joint work is published by Harper and will be published on Tuesday by A Square Meal, which describes the history of American food as the great recession of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity when they met with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiro Clouder, and was opened the same year that the major stock market collapse took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe, in turn, turkey, potatoes and mixed mushrooms.
When the supplier ordered meatloaf, the couple said it was appropriate for a very large debate on the eating of depression.
"The pieces were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"The people ate peanuts, liver fractures, and beans.
They were made of substances that were cheap and discrete.
Imagine your eating so much peanuts that they'll be enough for the whole meal."
Andrew Coe giggling.
"It must have hit the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great recession years, the American table, in particular in the countryside, was operating on the buffet principle, " eat as much as you want".
Women made food for agricultural workers, and for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they served the newly-baked pies.
The Americans had just sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a krona of the ways in which the people survived when suddenly they were forced to give up their abundance.
"This was a time when food became a central and disturbing subject for the Americans" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Another attractive diet: According to Ziegelman, valuable foods such as food and food products became the main food, and the pasta food was said to be "a powerful way to make use of the food stars" because cocaine could not be so attractive to cover up preparations with cream sauce.
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which for each year had been the main part of the American meal, became a sustainable luxury.
strange blends were used where the most important was the fulfilment of calorie and nutritional values, and not even the taste or even the healthy kitchen culinary.
When conducting a study for a book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared pasta-time snacks filled with peanut butter filled with peanut butter.
"It didn't get any popularity at the dinner table," says Coe, where to where it won't go.
Ziegelman adds: "It was unreal.
The peanut butter and the oven are not compatible at all.
This was characterized by many household prescriptions."
Household experts, like Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office for Home Affairs in 1923-1943, directed the citizens' eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
In newspapers and magazines, they published recipes and articles and encouraged women to be very budgeted and to meet the challenge of making taboo-kermaspage like carrot-kermaspaget delicious food species.
The A Square Meal book is a historic festival of sausages.
Specially delicious are reports of the reactions of government leadership to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "I'm going to eat cake" position.
While publicly respecting his childhood's simple food on the Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become him.
"He liked a manner European kitchen, like fish and cucumber sauce," says Coe.
"He ate almost in the golden floored dining room, with a tuxedo on his head.
He was totally attracted to reality."
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to show his stomach for example.
As the book says, Mrs. Roosevelt hired an economic minister who was not interested in taste at all, the food offered in the White House was not only Washington's most boring, but also the worst-made."
Many of the sheep's meal was abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and nutrients and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the student says that he has become better aware of the eating habits of the mother of Ziegelman, for example, why he could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid that food would have to throw away," say Coe.
"The people even began to feel bad about his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For the first time, windcrackers."
When the main food plates had been wiped out at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out the bone-print food they prepared at home, the same as President Roosevelt at his lunch.
"It's called a broom cream," says Ziegelman and adds that giving a very clear name to modest receptors was a common trick.
There was no cream wax, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We dug up our spoons in contrast with a thick brown piece of wood.
I'm surprised it didn't taste bad.
Coe danced for the second time and the third time.
"The Germans would do better", Coe says to his wife, sound like a positive budget manager.
Gilead is fully reimbursed for Gilead for the legal fees for hepatitis C vaccine patents with Merck.
The court of the United States has decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive a full compensation for the fees incurred by Merck & Co Inc for the legal dispute concerning the patent of hepatitis C medicinal products with the physician Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was released from the damages of 200 million dollars of damage imposed on it by the violation of two Merck-owned patents in the context of Gilead's Sovaldi and Harvoni-names.
In a complaint registered on Thursday, US Regional Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was entitled to be released from the legal fees it suffered from the defence of the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, who manages the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat over 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other and demanded that sofosbuvir be given the right of private ownership under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
The troops supported by the United States have taken over from the Isis of the City of Manbij from the city of Manbij, Isis, from the city of Manbij.
U.S. supported troops have been captured by forces in northern Syria, near Turkey's border in Manjib, when the last ultra-ordinary Isis fighters left the city, reports the team's informant.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group is now invading the city to find the last Isis warriors hiding in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council of SDF, Sharfan Darwish told Reuters that 2,000 hostages captured by the Isis fighters have been released.
"We're in full possession now, but we're still carrying out search operations," said Darwish.
The Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax return, which shows that the income of him and his husband at that time amounted to $ 10.55 million and the actual federal tax rate paid by them was 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton earned nearly 5.3 million dollars as speech fees, and the Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, who had previously served as Foreign Minister, announced that he earned $3 million from his letter of Simon & Schuster, which dealt with his term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The ten-year tax returns were published by Clinton Vice-President, Governor of Virginia’s Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton.
The real federal tax rate paid by them in 2015 was 20,3 per cent.
" Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to look like a model for financial transparency," says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier in his communication.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind excuses and withdraws his promises to publish his tax information.
According to the custom, the U.S. presidents have always published their tax data, even though the law does not require it from them.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have been appealing to the tax administration's review and they say it's the reason Trump hasn't published his income data.
"Shire is yours", referring to the tax information provided by Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, a democratic candidate for tax purposes.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, the special legal assistant for Trump, told CNN that he would not let Trump publish his tax data until the checks were completed.
The Trump critics, including the presidential candidate for the 2012 Republican Republican Mitt Romeney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to publish information raises questions about Trump's equity, his grants to charity, his business relations and many other ties that include relations with Russia as well.
Clinton has taken this question and published a video on Friday, online, where he will bring out prominent Republicans who are implicating Trump's tax data to publish their tax data.
Thursday, Clinton raised the matter in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Dump refuses to do what every candidate for the presidency has been doing for decades, and does not publish his tax returns," said Clinton to the people of the population.
According to the Politico newspaper, Trump did not pay taxes at all or paid just a little for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business collunst quoted on Friday a number of taxpayers and auditors that the situation may still be similar.
The federal tax rates have risen to a key issue for the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a billion-dollar investor named Warren Buffett for a regulation that would make sure that more than a million dollars a year earn at least 30% of the tax.
Mr Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week at the Clinton election in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, which is located in the same location as the Berkshire Hathaway multi-sector company in Berkshire, challenged Trump's meeting where both of them would reveal their tax data.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to a tax audit by the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of tax authorities but of voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007 until the end of the year.
The Clintons currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid a real federal tax on average 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014 and their actual combined tax rate was around 40.5 per cent.
It is clear from the Clinton 2015 tax return that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid for earnings.
Their main investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and the Clintons reported the sum of dividends and interest incomes at USD 109 000.

Chil powder- ground- ground- ground- ground- ground-conconconconconconconconconconms in Tanzania, Tanzania, Tanzania, Thailand, and in Tanzania, in the case of Chi powder powder powder powder powder powder powder powdered, with a bone bone bone boned in shells, with the support for the protection of the elephants, with the protection of the elephants, in Tanzania,
Naturalists in Tanzania have found an unusual way to keep the elephants away from the human home – elephants are being abused by throwing the condoms filled with chili powder toward them.
The Keino has proved to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which developed the idea a few years ago, has started a campaign with the United States of America's Nature Conservancy organization to teach volunteers from northern Denmark to how the residents can protect their homes and farmed elephants without harming their homes and elephants.
Just a while ago, there were spears used to make up the elephants.
Friday is the day of the world, which is dedicated to the protection of animals.
"As we have examined the method, we have seen changes in these villages, because now the villagers can rely on them to keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," says Jamian Bell, Executive Director of the Honeyguide Foundation, in his announcement.
First, the intruding elephant is alarmed by showing a flashlight and playing a horn.
If this doesn't work, throw the so-called chili cloud.
The multi-combusted chili powder is placed in a condom together with a condenser, and then the condom's head is turned in such a way that only the ignition yarn is excluded.
When the ignition thread is lit, the condom blows open and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually one spice cloud is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way is a throw-in that shoots a Roman candle into the air of a well-known joystick and generates a loud and clear explosion.
Jewish film director criticises the Berlin hotel on the removal of the Israeli direction number from the Arab "hot" – RT News.
A French, roots Jewish film director gave birth to a media track after he discovered that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel does not mention the Israel's reference number in its country number list. The hotel's employee called upon the Arab customers to ask for "hots".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on holocasmation, deported his frustration to the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
With a recent visit, Lanzmann was trying to find the hotel's destination list for Israel.
However, this was not the case among the countries in which you can call directly from the room.
"How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist?"
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kampinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through a separate call centre.
The film director asked an explanation about the hotel reception.
Lanzmann writes the reception officer's response to shocking him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was "The decision carefully considered by the management of the Kmpinski Hotel".
The reason behind the measure further shocked the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said, "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand that Israel's direction number be removed."
Suddeutsche Zeitung's interview with Israel's German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman said the case was "great shame".
"The match is killing and shocking all of us.
It's a big shame.
And the more shameful it is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is exactly what this hotel chain is about.
No further explanation is necessary.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," says the ambassador.
The case was caused by quite a reaction online, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused the Kempinski Hotel simply of giving up the alleged requirements of customers in Arabic.
"Get away" was said in a publication which highlighted the location of the hotel near the Kurfurstendamm street of the synagogue.
Der Spiegel writes in the hotel's controversial accusations, quickly, calling it a mistake, and asking for forgiveness from Lanzmann.
"The direct order to leave Israel was never given out of the heading list," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kumpinski Hotel Representative.
It adds that the heading number has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets for the demonstration of Brazilian students.
The students contacted the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered together to show their views on the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protestors.
Melakation began when law enforcement officers tried to break down a group of students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
There were hundreds of students who wanted to show their appreciation for the government's plans.
Professor Geraldo Alckmin of the State of Sao Paulo has proposed a saving measure in which nearly 100 public schools will be closed and 300 000 students will be invested in new schools.
Some of the protestors made graffitis for walls which temporarily opposed Michel Temer, who was responsible for the president's office.
Students' demonstrations took place only a few days after the disappearance of the streets of President Dilma Roussef, who were in favour of Dilma Roussef, when the Senate voted on this charge.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 % – RT Business RT Business
The annual trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent following the exit of the sanctions, reports Russia's Iranian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in the business of Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were repealed.
"Vehicle companies continue to have existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further development of trade is one of the priorities for cooperation between countries", says Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 per cent, to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
Trade accelerated the sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," says Ambassador.
Dzhagayan also expects a record of Iranians to travel to Russia this year.
"In the last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
Furthermore, Iran was for the first time among the 20 first countries whose citizens were travelling to Russia for the first time.
It is not too dare to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia is breaking this year," he says.
In turn, the number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which ambassador hopes to change.
"I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Skotti Callum Skinner climbed the goal of winning Brits when he won the bike gold.
Scotlandn Callum Skinner had a reputation for the men's team star in Rio's debt last night when the UK's triangle defended London's 2012 earned championship.
Skinner, a 23-year-old in Glasgow, was the anchor he inherited from a Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, who made a legend proud when he thanked the goal and caught the victory from a team in New Zealand.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won his fifth six Olympic Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after they had settled in the World Cup in London on 6 March, London, despite the fact that Hoy had since left his race career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff specialising in the role of the first leader.
The price came up at just the right time.
Hoy's decision to end the race also left a hole that Kian Momdi and Matt Crampton tried to complete.
Scottish Skinner was the man to which the British coach believed and where they saw the potential which he has now redeemed.
Hines, Hoy and the champion, who won Kenny and Skinner four years ago, made an Olympic record in time, but in the first round, New Zealand was faster.
And the British triangle won the gold in a duel.
The price was very much behind after the round, but Kenny pushed the team's lead, which Skinner retained.
The majority of the change was to change the strategy by slowing down the speed at a larger speed, which allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy followed up as a commenter at BBC and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' eye when they entered the award interest rate.
Skinner, a 23-year-old in Glasgow, says, "I'm flattered about peer-relation.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did the Olympic performance at the final and won the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win it."
After winning in London in 2012 Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he fell on the track for the purpose of bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his words, and the British competitors did not have any means of appeal.
This time sovereign victory had no such problems.
Hinds says: "The feeling was like in London, all the British flags went down in the lobby.
Our team became united over the last three months.
We've lost so many world truths that victory in the Olympics seems great."
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten wheelchairs in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, the five days ahead are successful with the debt.
As Kenny has shown in his ability, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympics in action at the Olympics.
This would mean an account of six gold medals and one silver medals for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and is also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday).
In other words, the reduction would be the same as in Hoy.
Kenny's next race in a sprint that starts today and will be settled in three days' time.
Kenny, a 28-year-old in Bolton, says, "Now I can only be happy about this.
The team race is always the best.
You'll enjoy your victory with a friend.
You know, winning yourself is a little lonely."
He says, "If he wins two more gold medals, he must have the value of the knight."
This was the only medal event of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four men's team time.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and that won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (cf. 22.42) will be competed today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of the attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competition operators before the time took place when he was invited by the operators to measure his length.
In the same competition for women, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milgaavia reached the world record time of 4:13.260.
The British team can now be confident that its awesome bike team will take responsibility for the middle of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After truly exceptional demonstrations of complete leadership in Beijing and London, expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas in the background, of which few of them do not have the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexual and bullying claims, and the end of the competitions of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night with the debt securities show that the already legendary reputation of the United Kingdom is once again realized at the top at the perfect moment.
The future future future future future future future future of the Portland's melting of Portland, in the light of the end of the electricity agreement, is due to the end of the end of the electricity agreement.
The future of the aluminium alloy sink operating in Portland, Victoria, and therefore the thousands of workers' jobs are at stake when the power company that powers electricity to the fuses said that one of the owners of the factory is about to decommission the supply contract and is expected to terminate all supply contracts.
This is the result of the decision taken by the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the aid to be maintained by the factory.
The aid granted for 20 years shall cease in November.
There is a risk that even 2,000 jobs are lost from the Alcoan Portland factory.
As a result, even 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be put at risk because of exclusions.
The snowball effect may continue to increase as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's melting plant, resulting in the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting plant is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures correspond to the speculators that have been going on for years since the future of the factory, which were initially caused by Australia's strong dollar and recent plant production prices.
AGL, which delivers electricity to a large aluminium alloy plant from its Loy Yang A power plant located in Latrobe Valley, says it is expected that the other three owners will also terminate their contract.
Alcoan and Alumina are the majority owner of a joint venture. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says that it expects the Portland production plant to operate permanently, which means that physical electricity demand from the melting plant continues.
The AGL states that the agreements were to enter into force in November 2016.
The notice of termination of contracts is 12 months, so it will expire in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects contracts to generate income in 2017", says the power plant.
The potential effects of return on AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by a strong future market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million "prevention of contracts".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate agreements "will not affect the capacity of Alcoan ... to keep the fuser operational or to secure the supply of electricity to the fuser".
The American company informed me that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force since November of this year, although it still has to explain why it has now withdrawn the agreement.
In view of the weak economic situation of the sector, analysts have been cautious in assessing both the melting plant operating in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago factory near Newcastle.
AGL's operational director, Stephen Mikkelsen, told the analysts earlier this week about 600 megawattt electricity and Tomago about 900 megawattts per year.
"If these factories leave the market, that means a significant decline in demand (electric) market.
As a producer, it wouldn't be good news for us," says Mikkelsen.
Cardashiiant-to-t television star Kendall as the cover girl of the Vogue on September Voguee in September.
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner clan and the fourth daughter of his mother and manager Kris, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the United States Vogue's famous September issue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's advertising plant and performed on Milan, Paris and New York fashions, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"The watching of the show in a room full of my loved ones, " got me in tears," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the cover picture was followed by a strange (or perhaps only following the style of the Kardashiant series?), a scripted video in which all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family were present (the baroques Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite uncle, the Kardashiant programme producer Ryan Seacrest) who forgot about his sister's cover picture. The video ends with a classic version: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost all the birthday periods of the programme (Seacrest says the words: "Did you think that we had forgotten you?" as sincerely as the child's morning-TV character), but Krisin had to have other daughters in some way to this publicity?
For the appearance of the Vogue in September means without doubt a new period of the Cardashian era.
Kendal's great sister Kim was able to reach Vogue's complaint before (i.e. appeared in Vogue's deck together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is its own class.
The number of September is Vogue's most sold publication per year.
The number of advertisers that resembled a larger image book than the fashion page attracts a large number of advertisers (the fashion site in Fashion fell to the fact that in the 832 page lesson of last year there were 615 pages of advertisements).
The publication of the September issue is expected to be so intense that in the two previous years, the pictures of the magazine have leaked to the public even before the official announcement.
Previous September's cover patterns include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has been more famous than models that are famous for the work of the model.
The Oscar winner and Dior commercial tumor Jennifer Lawrence was in cover for 2013, and later the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes the Jenner as a success model for his generation, and even if he is more of a group of celebrities who work for the model, he is still quite good in the company.
These celebrities are not family to well-known people, true-TV stars or children today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of them).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry over others.
The Beyonce last year's cover show has one of the strongest years of his career when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of its true-TV background, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be a pain.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and his colleague, Gigi Hadidia, by calling them "shits".
These feelings have reappeared when the news of Jenner's presence on the deck of Vogue became famous.
However, the constant palpitations of dissatisfaction seem immaterial.
Kendall Jenner is a cover model for the Voguen September issue.
He's a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's walking to Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
She's the advertising plant for the Estee Lauder goals.
He and all his sisters sell pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, the one she shot in the LOUVE magazine.
And at his leisure time, he's on real-time TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and her children.
The Legal aid centres shall be turned aside 1600,000 000 000 people per year each year, 1600,000 000 per year, 160 000 per year, 160 000 per year, of a year, 1600,000 per year, 160 000
Each year, more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries are turned away from legal aid centres, and the sector is preparing for the impact that further cuts in appropriations will already have on centres operating at extreme limits.
In the Land of Queensland, three of the people who are seeking legal assistance and legal services are being turned away from five people – most of them are older people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified sanctions and similar injustice without resources.
Public legal aid services, which are already under pressure, are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing 30% more of federal funding.
James Farrell, head of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, reports that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Legal Aid Office, thousands of people are being turned away annually from the centres.
If the federal government does not decide, Farrell says that the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are constantly under-funded, which means that thousands of people are being turned away when they are applying for the necessary services", says Farrell.
"The people who leave national relations, the people who are out of control and are impoverishing the burden of debt, the families in divorce, the workers who are unduly dismissed – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The federal government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to deal with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Queensland's senator George Brand to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid to the national average level.
It is now time to take account of the needs of the public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Palasczu Government must invest in this important work."
The action against Donald Trump's campaign was brought against the attack on the threat of an employee by a weapon.
New York: There was an action against Donald Trump's campaign when no action was expected to be taken after it had been announced to the management that the director of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun when they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event will be described in the action brought by Vincent Bordini, former state software teacher of the state campaign at the Court of Justice of the State on Wednesday in Charlotte.
Bordin says that he expected months to discuss the situation within the campaign before he understood that this would not happen, according to his own words.
Bordini says when he claims that Earl Phillip, the campaign manager, "he put out a gun, put his right finger on the trigger, and pushed the tip to Vincent's knee arm".
After the complaint was lodged with the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini was informed that at least four other persons had experienced the same situation with Phillip.
"Although the gun wouldn't fire, it'll cause damage," says Bordin in his action.
The action will only come two days after the presidential candidate of the Republican gave the general anger when he said to the people in North Carolina that "the second-round supporters" – where gun owners and gunmen will be held – may take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and gets elected judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media blew off his word in context, and Trump did not say he encouraged violence.
The Bordini will claim compensation for the campaign as a result of inconsistency and compensation for Phillip for assault, assault, and mental suffering caused by them.
The Trump's editor, Hope Hicks, did not respond directly to the message he asked him to comment.
No attempt was made to reach Phillip despite the companies.
Charlotte's local press agency WCCB told me that Phillip just left a campaign.
No immediate response was received to the call requested by Phillip in consultation with the Innovative Consulting Services.
Donald Trump, President of the Republic, has been a controversial campaign.

Britain has to use the Olympic Olympics to extend Heathrow to expand Heathrow.
Heathrow also stimulates the economy and creates prosperity — not only in local communities and London, but in the whole country.
For myself, this was the most interested in Heathrow. As in the Olympics in London 2012 we made a huge contribution to the benefits of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics have brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new places of training and 40 000 new jobs, which removes unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
Like the Olympics in London in 2012, there are always people who feel that the expansion of Heathrow is too much of a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I was told that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow as well as about Heathrow.
There are always possible obstacles, but Heathrow will answer every question that has been asked.
Like the Olympics, including Heathrow, it is an infrastructure project that benefits many, not many, but many.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing know-how and employment to both the airport's environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great task force on Heathrow, which has carried out in time and remained in the budget an investment program of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure, which included the T5 terminal – which has been voted for the best terminal of the year for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two world's steep runways.
They are now ready to produce third runways, supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for Heathrow enlargement so that we can guarantee our trade in the future and create knowledge and employment from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook adsteneston for cat mouse game
The efforts of companies that earn money from online advertising to mislead advertising technology software have changed into cat mouse games, says one company that generates blocking programs.
Thursday, just two days after Facebook had announced on his own side to prevent advertising engine programs, Adblock Plus published a blog library, where it told us that users can update their esto software filters and thus again prevent community service advertising.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the subscription codes for advertisements on their desktop website, making it harder to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock tells me that he's figured out the new codes.
In his blog paper, Adblock's editor Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of balling between the advertising community of the open source source and the delusional community has been ongoing since the conclusion of the advertising team", and that it is possible that Facebook will make its own corrections again soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the great concern that advertisingists have become a sector.
Overall, it is estimated that 200 million people are using advertising engineering programs, reports a study carried out by Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has been nearly fourfold since 2013.
Facebook is daily using 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile advertising already accounts for 84% of Facebook advertising revenue.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertising programmes in its desktop application, as the media noted that mobile advertising prevention programs do not work on Facebook mobile applications and Instagram.
The income from Desktop advertising is still high enough, so Facebook considered the contribution profitable.
On Tuesday Facebook also told us that they will update the advertising tool for user settings so that users can more control how advertisements are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters, as they also prevent the appearance of some common Facebook burnings.
"This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem" said Facebook's informant in his e-mail.
"The advertising programmes are clumsy and inefficient, and that is why we have invested in developing user configurations such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of advertising themselves.
A woman committed suicide by leaving a car behind a car on a Swiss motorway on a Swiss motorway.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police asked for the help of witnesses on the freeway on Thursday, Thursday, the first incident that occurred during the first few hours of the day, where a woman deliberately fell under more than one car.
The accident occurred on the A1 engine road in Vadi canton near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did her desperate act by laying down a dark road, and she was hit by more cars, telling me when she was informing the Vood police.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and his attempt was obviously to commit suicide.
A woman's death at the scene of the event.
According to the police, many car drivers involved have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter explains in the Le Tribune de Geneva newspaper that a criminal investigation has been launched, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges against drivers involved in the accident are being raised.
" Was it impossible to avoid collision?
It's going to keep the state's attorney informed," says Hofstetter.
There have been two similar cases in the last five years, according to which drivers are not considered to be responsible.
According to the newspaper, in either case a person walked on a dark freeway and the right to decide that motorists cannot expect to meet their pedestrian on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police officer was released from a charge which had been brought against him from a death penalty after he met a man who lay on the A1 engine road near Paynerne one August night in 2014.
The court found that the 22-year-old victim had had had had had plenty of alcohol and had fallen off the road.
The Court found that the way a police officer, who was responding to an emergency, was justified and that a man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unexpected situation".
Of all the accidents that took place in Morges near Thursday, some scientists are asked to call the police in 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable for life.
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model that enables Venus’s past to be studied using the same tools and algorithms as climate researchers are using.
The model was designed to determine whether the conditions on the boat may have been similar to those on earth, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its gas atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide-free.
According to researchers' previous presentations, Venus's slow speed is explained by its thick gas body.
However, on the basis of the latest simulation, it can be assumed that Brother has had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and yet it has slowed down.
The model was also used to determine early Venus’s surface formation.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variations to maintain life and prevent rapid defrosting.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent lower than the sun.
"In GISS model, Venus is running slowly and its half per sun is almost two months per day", says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the press release.
This warms up the surface and generates rain that creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer works like a umbrella and protects the surface from a large part of the sun heat.
As a result, average global temperatures are even slightly lower than current Earth temperatures.
The model was used to create Venus's story, which is responsible for the earlier assumptions of planet researchers about its development costs.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and UV light for several billion years.
His oceans disappeared, and the UV light burned the steamed water.
As the hydrogen ran out into space, only a thick carbon-rich gas-rich and deadly greenhouse effect — i.e. Venus as it is today.
Researchers reported the results of the new Venus Air Model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy will resign as coach of Avalanchen.
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice-president of the association hockey operations, calling for a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
The Vice-Chairman of Colorado/Sakic, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the Society will immediately start applying for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have conducted my mission as head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and as vice-president of the association hockey operations with a strong, passionate and determined nature", says Roy, a 50-year-old in his statement.
"I've been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the necessary depth and raise it to a higher level during the summer.
In order to achieve this, the vice-president of the coach and the vice-president of the hockey activities of the association must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have authority over decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me his decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him every good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the past year for his first period as Head Coach of Avalanche 2013–2014.
Under his leadership, the Society reached 112 points and won the mid-division, but Colorado lost its way to Minnesota in a fall game and has not reached the end of the last two years.
Avalanche reached 39-39-4 points in the period 2015-2016 and reached five points in the middle of the second Wild Card game in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame painter Roy won in his career four Stanley Cups – two in the Montreal Canadiens line and two in the Avalanchen row.
The oil workers in the North Sea start negotiations and stop the strike.
The main advisors report the wage gap between oil workers in the North Sea and when all the parties to the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oilfield services, has used drilling cars in the North Sea, controlled by Royal Dutch Shell, which are located in the North Sea.
According to the Joint Declaration of the Parties, "Wood Group and Trade Unions Unit and RMT confirm that they have agreed to relaunch the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding several day-long meetings over the next few weeks to deal with recent issues.
The trade unions justified their recent activities, which they claimed was the first to be more than 25 years, as a protest to potential pay cuts of up to 30%.
Due to the negative market pressures, Wood Group is cutting around 9 per cent of its contractors operating in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in the company's tariffs follows the calculation of the prices of contractors working in countries by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it a space of movement that is necessary for it to be able to figure out the rate of fall on the market.
In turn, Shell has cut off thousands of workers from its pay list and has announced its plans to leave oil and gas drilling activities in up to 10 countries, thus making it more efficient to work with the British Energy Company BG Group after its megafusion.
The lower oil prices and the economic situation, as a result of the decision of the United Kingdom in June to leave the European Union, create pressure on energy companies.
The Scottish Member, Dave Anderson, met with the working leaders earlier this week in order to discuss one of the largest conflicts of work that the North Sea has experienced in a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital for the region's economy.
"In the North Sea and the whole country, we need a economy that has advantages for many and not just a few," says Anderson.
New North Sea projects are expected to be worth less than USD 1.4 billion in 2016, when they have been spent around EUR 7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler will measure the rate of rotation of the stars in the Plejades star range.
The latest task of Kepler's mission has been to measure the speed of the stars, which has helped the astronauts to gather so far the most comprehensive list of the speeds of the stars that are part of the Plejades Star crowd.
On the basis of the new data, astronomy can determine why stars belonging to the same group of stars spin at different speeds and how circular periods relate to the planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing the results with other stars we learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even about the history of its solar system", says Luisa Rebull, researcher at the University of Caltech, in the press release at Pasadena.
The star mass of the Plejads is located 445 light-years from the Earth.
A number of stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means they are just about reaching their adult life.
At the moment, they're running faster than ever.
With the speed on the top of the adult stars, large amounts of starwind are decompressed.
These winds have a brake effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate is slowing down.
Kepler shall measure the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of identifying star spots (corresponding to solar clouds).
The latest listed speed data suggest that larger stars run faster than smaller stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers – the larger ones are slowing down more slowly than the smaller one.
"We see the "Dance" of the Plejades, that slow spins are typically larger, whereas the fastest wheels are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Since the number of Plejades is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory to compare the star properties to the speeds of rotation.
"The group of stars offers a support pillar for theoretical models dealing with the rotation of both the younger and the older stars," says Rebull.
We still want much more information on how, when and why stars slow down their rotational speed and end their "dance".
Rebull and his colleagues present their latest analysis of the speeds of Plejades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
