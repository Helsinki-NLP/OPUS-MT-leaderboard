The Prague Stock Exchange was reduced at the end of the trade, at the end of the trade, at the end of the sale.
The Prague Stock Exchange has repaired its losses after the fall in the morning.
Transactions in shares of the Czech Energy Industry (ČEZ) amounted to nearly half of the usual daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to crash on Monday from the start of the trading in Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street's shares is behind the fall.
We also have the market reaction to the outcome of the vote of the American Parliament, which rejected the support for the stabilisation plan for the financial sector in question.
This is the fall of shares in Asia, Asia.
On the Asian stock exchanges, the dramatic drop in shares took place on Tuesday, although the indicators over the day were finally removed part of the losses were lost.
The Hang Seng Exchange Index of Hong Kong recorded almost four percent during the trading period, but later it deleted part of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index was 3.8 per cent closed in Shanghai.
Stocks of the Sydney Stock Exchange have lost more than 5%, but the losses have finally decreased to 4.3 per cent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index there, decreased by 3.6 per cent.
"The timing of the American rescue is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, Head of the Hong Kong Financial Advisory Council.
Hong Kong, although China is part of, its financial policy is determined independently, i.e. by the central bank of China.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are on the same level as the United States of America.
According to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should immediately start negotiations again and accept the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, other countries are threatening to feel the consequences of this.
The blood bath of American shares is the blood bath of American shares.
On Monday, the U.S. Parliament rejected the draft financial support for the financial system, which should have been translated into USD 700 billion (up to 12 billion krona).
The legislators thus ignored President Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush says that the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, American stock had been through a blood bath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest crash over 20 years.
Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, a similar fall last year in 1987.
The index came before the vote, but as soon as it turns out that the proposal was not accepted in the House of Representatives, the index started to be free.
Congress went back to Congress: The US Government can therefore pump $ 700 billion into banks like that.
The main leaders of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed to provide financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in a broader form of the agreement and to the American financial system.
This is the vote at the beginning of the next week.
The US legislators have committed a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the emergency plan in the form of a financial assistance of USD 700 billion (approx. 12 billion crowns) to the US financial system.
But there is no victory yet.
For the convention must complete some of the details of the agreement before it can be published in the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system support will be discussed at the Assembly on Monday.
On Sunday, he informed the Reuters News Agency Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Organisation Committee.
According to Senate sources, they are likely to vote on the draft on Wednesdays as soon as possible.
According to the economy, it should be reported that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, "recognition" will be done.
Paulson: The plan must be effective.
"We've taken a long step.
We have resolved different views on what should be the form of a market stabilisation package," said Bloomberg Agency for Democracy Nancy Pelosi.
He says that the final vote will take place on Sunday.
Lawyers met with Henry Paulson on Saturday night, the US Minister of Finance, to give the government a final form of government funds.
This should take into account the unsustainable mortgages on financial corporations that cause serious losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are in favour of the final agreement on a draft which will work and which will have to be effective on the market at the same time.
The repair plan needs to continue, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Marking the Asian trade in trade in Asia.
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling rapidly.
According to Senator Harryid Nevadai, lawmakers are therefore seeking to reach an agreement on Sundays in Congress for the rest of the Sunday.
This is why they want to reassure investors before they start trading in Asian money markets, where the decision of Congress could first influence the trading of Mondays due to the time zone.
It is not clear yet, however, when two chambers of American Congress are voting on the law, as is not the case, whether at the last moment the trial is not possible because of some problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
As requested by President Bush, the first USD 350 billion should be made available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the remaining amount, which has been set at a further USD 100 billion and later in USD 350 billion, if it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function.
Bush assessed progress in negotiations on negotiations.
Although the President may reject this decision, Congress may overrule the hostage.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was the acquisition of material assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, was maintained, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to delete the mortgage loans of thousands of Americans.
"We've worked everything out out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg Republican.
With the progress made in the negotiations, American President Bush is pleased with the progress that has been made.
Tony Fratto, the speaker of Bush, stated that the president was satisfied with and appreciates "to stabilise our financial markets and to protect our economy from double efforts".
Restriction of bus end-of-bus payments
Christopher Dodd, President of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, on the protection of taxpayers from losses, on the closure of the discounts and on the timing of the draft financing plan.
The new law also limits the final implementation of the so-called bus managers and establishes a committee to monitor the Fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked hard on this, and we made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to houseowners who have problems with eradicating them.
In the case of the government's purchased mortgage accounts, the government should issue new cancellations with a view to reducing the monthly deductions of the debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Mark: Spiritual Assistance
The proposed draft is a good idea, according to David Marek, head of Patria Finance, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"It is because it is not possible to know what mechanism the problem actives are going to be purchased at what cost they will be selling.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share losses among themselves," said Marek this week on the iHNed.cz website.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"The more important thing is that the Congress has decided this week to support the plan and, as soon as possible, give their blessing.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," said Marek.
A few battles on the edge: MP3 players versus mobiles.
We help you choose how to choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It seems clear to me that it is better just to buy a phone.
Still, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which it is used and on the needs of the future owner.
Probably hard to get a top-quality high-end record player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on bakery records, but, on the other hand, there is no objective reason for this in terms of quality.
However, if polcai is full of art rock, jazz or blues bagel records, it is likely to dream of such a record player.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. compacted - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it can be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan probably has a hard time accepting a 20-year-old market earring.
Two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of the elements is also a matter of life.
Some of the top-quality music players are much more capable than simply playing music, but also the ones for which the majority of mobiles are not by chance.
None of the current devices are as universal as the phone.
In addition to the main features, phone calls and text messages, you can play music and video, both of them, you have a better-less camera, even navigation.
And if you take into account Smartphones and communicaters, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a miracle, because no fridge can have grilled and no television can photograph it.
Multi-functional mobile phones have disadvantages, however.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more times you send the display to the charger.
And music playing is one of the biggest energy grids in the world.
Smallly mobile devices capable of playing music for more than ten to twelve hours, mostly less than that.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more effective than music players.
For this reason, account for the fact that you will not be played for more than a few hours.
Even if you make a phone call here and there, get a charger at work, just in case - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will have no such problem, even worse ones will face at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one upload.
The next problem arises when you upload music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only limited parts of the devices have a universal USB container, and besides, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers deal with miniature memory cards used in mobiles without a adapter.
Players need no special software with some exceptions (iPod).
Enough equipment from the computer to download music via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating their own musical library, the album, the name of the genre, or, for example, the musical library set up on the basis of the user's evaluation.
Some devices represent only a wooden structure similar to Windows Explorer, and they know some of them (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones operating system).
Players can be easier to manage, mobiles can learn more about mobiles.
For the selection of a specific device, you should focus on battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and, of course, the comfort of treatment.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and listens only for a short time a day on the electricity, any MP3 player's mobile will match you with any MP3 player.
And by then, you can really do any cell phone you want.
You don't have to pay particular attention to what musical formats the mobile or player knows.
With MP3, all will be successful and most of the music you receive will be in this format.
The MP3 is among the most common, and the vast majority of the devices in addition to the WMA-shaped music.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPod) is less likely to occur.
Better mobiles also allow on-line music shopping, for example.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the provider (or other service provider) and purchase the song or album via mobile internet.
This service itself can be a strong argument for obtaining a music cell phone.
Unfortunately, service providers offer poor supply and are generally limited to single-hull radio signals.
The prices are not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that music will control the music in the future (although through GSM, Internet or wireless internet).
Most people keep keeping their mobile devices on their own all the time.
He's going to listen to something whenever he wants, his cell phone is going to hang out in his pocket, while the forgotten MP3 player at home is lying around.
However, it also depends on whether or not he's still carrying earphones or at least extremities with him.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which are almost all cell phones, but only few MP3 players have enough MP3 players.
For many, the most likely advantage of music phones will be price.
The lowest is usually less than 3 000 crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent walkman.
But most of all, you are limited by the lack of output from a traditional earpiece.
The best and most technically equipped telephones may be placed at least 15 thousand crowns with conventional earphones with a diameter of 3.5 mm.
The benefit of players, however, is also a simple treatment.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily, with the treatment of the cheapest players (see our selection) everyone really can handle it.
A minimum function, the treatment comparable to the previous standard cassette tape or Gramophone is obvious.
There will be no collapse in the form of accidentally connected mobile internet, nor will there be a huge bill following the transfer of data.
Which device should we choose?
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually available on replaceable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
By buying the right card, you can use up to a maximum of two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones know what to do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and even want to buy cheap MP3 players, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
On the basis of the capacity (max. 2 GB) it does not need to spend more than a 100 years of age.
If you belong to more than one student, choose a special mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have separate MP3 control buttons, so that the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson received the most advanced one, which has the same user interface for walkman's serial mobiles as MP3 players sold separately.
The above brands have the same service as MP3 players in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with higher memory capacity (although 16 GB) and battery life span (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider is still entering the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
In the Czech mobile market, relatively advanced and service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, something is missing for us - a virtual service provider for significant price reductions for classic service providers.
Maybe it won't be long now.
The Mobil.cz website has often been written that Czech service providers in Europe are among the most expensive.
This has also been confirmed by ČTÚ, which has pointed out that the price of text in Czech Republic is more expensive than in other countries of the Union.
After the last step in the European Commission's regulation of roaming charges, there may be a conflicting situation - some of the Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than the domestics for some customers from abroad.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, missing the competition that really wants to go into battle.
This may sound contradictory, because we have three mobile networks, and our penetration is high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators would like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In many cases, Pavel Dvo delayák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, who has stated several times that there is no place for a new service provider in the Czech Republic.
It is true that the classic service provider has probably not been able to get too many chances with its own network (which is likely to be difficult to find).
But there is yet another option - the virtual service provider.
Virtual service providers have just moved into the mobile market to make a significant drop in prices, and then they should have reacted to the classics.
Meanwhile, even before entering the market for large fish such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile Great Britain, we have heard voices similar to ours.
However, it has proved that such service providers have their place and can indeed succeed.
For example, we don't even have to go too far.
This February, we informed you about the launch of Mobilking's virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers over a period of not more than six months and to become the fifth largest provider there.
Meanwhile, the Penta Financial Group is behind Mobilking, which is the owner of the U:fon in Czech Republic other than the one in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much smaller target group.
For efficient operation, the traditional service provider needs much less customers than usual.
Because it does not involve relatively high costs of construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world are thus generally low-cost - offering low-cost calls and texts, which are often offset by less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Britain offers at least 50 percent lower rates than its competitors.
However, as demonstrated by the example of Mobilking in Poland, a very good move can also be accepted for a target group.
This service provider is particularly focused on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking provider - who likes who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of this Mobil Entertainment Company, who operates this virtual service provider.
It is difficult to determine whether a similar idea can be found in us in Poland.
Michael Čepický, the speaker of Vodafone, doubted: "The Czech market is relatively small to the segmental approach, on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
Moreover, it is relatively satisfactory for the provision of services."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance, and mobile providers are calling mobile providers to make mobile providers.
However, it seems almost certain that if some virtual service provider is in Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in Czech Republic negotiations do not seem to be too much hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of Penta's financial group during his interview with a person named Mobil.cz.
In general, it has been demonstrated that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic do not too agree with this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything in their power to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera group has for some time not kept its interest in initiating the virtual service provider, so that it intends to take another step in order to make Phone O2 a real competitor at the corporate customer's fairs.
"We are interested in providing not only our customers with fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
This option has been discussed repeatedly with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the spokesperson of the group.
Maybe it's time for better.
From informal information, it seems that the first virtual service provider can already be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by an impenetrable wall of silence for the time being.
"At this moment, we do not think that a fully-fledged virtual provider would have a place on the Czech market.
In contrast to the other markets, the Czech market is very special.
We have not so far been called upon by a single subject offering a complex and serious project in this area," said Mobil.cz from the press department Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02.
The Czech market is also referred to the specific situation of the other service providers.
Kemrova, T-Mobile's spokesperson with O2, added exceptionally to O2, "We have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects, which could be further based."
He added: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider would appear.
At this moment, there should be a concrete agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone would rather turn its attention towards meeting its own 3G licence requirements.
Michael Čepický adds: "We are here to negotiate with potential virtual service providers, in particular in the area of the sharing of costs and infrastructure.
From the point of view of clients, that is exactly what we consider to be the most affordable.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to establish partnerships for networks shared with fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - a string with service providers.
The mobile service provider’s procedure would easily be understandable, leading to an increase in competition, a drop in prices and a reduction in their profits.
So why should we facilitate the entry of such competition?
When service providers are able to cooperate, they are also witnessing the Huzavona around U:fon's birth.
The greatest pressure on ČTÚ is likely to be around the birth of the T-Mobile company U-phone.
This is what they testify about publicly available information on the ČTÚ website.
But right now, the U should be well-informed to ensure that the entry of the virtual service provider is not allowed.
Martina Kemrova added: "The environment for competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by access to the fourth mobile market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another player into the market and its services would result in high requirements."
However, given that attitude of mobile operators, the full lack of interest of Czech regulators is quite amazing.
In the meantime, it is not only about ČTÚ's attitude, which, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no right to intervene in economic competition.
For this purpose, only the Office shall be authorised.
However, the Office has a specific relationship with the problem as a whole.
"The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the contract between the mobile operator and the virtual service provider is concluded on the lease of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," said Kristián Churpua, the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Office, in response to our question.
A statement from service providers such as this would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office whose interests should be represented by consumers and, in addition to others, to ensure that no one can recover from its market situation, it is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristián Chaulubi adds: "From abroad, where virtual service providers generally operate, we can observe that their steps on the market have contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, the interests of the NEWS are likely to be outside the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and on price reductions.
In that case, the reaction of the three mobile operators is likely to have a very high degree of consistency between the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question is whether it really is just a coincidence, it's almost self-evident.
Just like at charging stations, totally identical petrol prices are probably just the works of random and hard competition.
"The Office did not find any evidence of an anti-competitive procedure in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the suppliers have a dominant position, i.e. no more than that of their market operations.
The means necessary to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chaloo said.
One of the many points in the debate is the presentation of the market leader position.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ on the basis of which telecommunications is the sole market from the perspective of economic competition.
After such a market, of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - it is always necessary to approve the network operator for the creation of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile operator - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
So a certain segment is necessarily dominant.
Even if we did not accept this argument, the NEWS should have a minimum interest in dealing with three mobile operators with an obvious similarity to that of three mobile operators.
The complaints made by interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they face very similar obstacles during the negotiations with all service providers.
The liability for ČTÚ is a relatively usual trick in telecommunications, which UHES takes his hands off the whole case.
We've met this before in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Communication Act, the expansion of ČTÚ's rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications could not be achieved, although many experts were hoping to improve the situation.
This should be well known by the representatives of the NEWS, but it is likely that their interests are different.
It works when nobody listens when nobody listens when nobody listens.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of false-virus service providers, of which Czech mobile networks already have many functions, remains unseen.
These are companies issuing own mobile telephone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
Because it's a multilevel marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Prices of these companies are usually only available for the selected ones.
The magic is that the company acts against the provider as a classic corporate customer, which offers a large amount of SIM cards.
You will then receive special discounts (and other discounts).
The problem is that the trading conditions for all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar withdrawals.
"If there were cases that he was talking about, the terms of the contract would be an infringement that we would be dealing with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrova answered our question about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that the news on this kind of activity would not have reached the responsibility of mobile operators' responsible personnel.
This could be the case for the three companies mentioned above, particularly for thousands of customers.
Meanwhile, none of the service providers will be able to defend themselves against such a procedure.
Because they do not have negligible profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike genuine virtual service providers, they do not, in particular, threaten their own official marketing.
Michael Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculations, however, only uses a negligible percentage of the customers' services.
They also have to accept that the SIM card on their phone does not appear on their name, so it cannot be fully provided as general clients of mobile service providers."
But that's exactly what ČU should look like.
In addition, another issue arises for the NEWS.
If mobile operators fail to follow a similar procedure, why do they interfere with the birth of a virtual provider?
It should be added that, in order to expose this kind of activity, UOMS has relatively strong rights and, if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of service providers that they did not know anything like this and that their trading conditions prohibit it from doing so.
When we don't get to be the most expensive.
As has been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers to the mobile market has led to a noticeable drop in prices of services.
In virtually all countries where virtual service providers have been established, classic service providers have tried to prevent them from being created more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied, too satisfied, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developed countries, at this very moment, regulators, which, in no way, protected the interests of mobile providers, but their customers, have taken action.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, it was said that the first virtual service provider that was followed by others was established.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators give the whole case to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that non-explicable competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider will indeed be available soon, the Czech mobile market might move again.
If one of the service providers would allow the establishment of a virtual mobile service provider, it will only be difficult to remain indifferent to the rejection of further interested parties (discrimination).
And compared to the rest of Europe, we may not be going to make more expensive calls.
The new Czech Himnus has four new versions.
Choose the best way to do the best.
Listen to four revisions of the new version of the Czech State Himmnus.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topoláek presented the state-of-the-art admissions to the state-of-the-art ceremony on the day of the Czech Republic.
The hymnust was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the leadership of Jiørí Bělóhlávs.
There are four versions available - with male or female solos, choirs or instruments.
Kateșina Knžžingova and Adam Plachetka sing.
Author of the revision of the hymnus Odokar Jeremiš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions of the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national song is considered one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already told him that he has deliberately chosen young speakers with representative voice to sing the variations that are expressive and popular.
"Even from the beginning, I tried both of them, and later, at the band, to take care of pure distribution, good understanding of the text and consistency," he said.
It celebrates the 175th anniversary of the Czech State's Himminus next year.
Where is my country? for the first time, in 1834, the song was silenced at the Rendi Theatre in addition to Frantishek Škroup's music in the first play by Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovovačka in 1834.
It was popular and people considered it spontaneously their own.
And the first verse of the song has become a natural part of the state hymnous after the formation of the 1818s of Czechoslovakia.
After the creation of the Czech Republic, seven public symbols remained one of the seven.
What a "new" hymnus is.
On the Wednesday of the Prague transport company, the first day of the year is to carry a chip card with a chip card.
Wednesday 1 October 2008 enter into the history of the Prague Transport Company when the first passenger will enter the subway, trams and busses, whose electronic coupon will be in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available for about a hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day, and an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time can save their chip cards in the centers and offices of the Transport Company at the airports of Muzeum, Mjstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačrov and Luka.
The coupons have been sold via the Internet since yesterday via the Transport Company www.dpp.cz website.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers until afternoon hours.
Those who start using the online trade may finally forget the billboards of metro stations, where they have had to go through long lines on a regular basis for the tickets.
The coupon can also be purchased via the Internet and the Opencard card will be saved on one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a bar with trained service providers who help interested parties to purchase the Internet and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrný, the speaker of the project.
In addition to libraries, electronic coupons can be saved on Opencard in some self-service machines installed in front halls.
What do these automats look like?
Reds, reminders, and passengers may have already noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovice, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavska metro stations.
"There are five of them in the city right now, but by the end of the year it should be eight," added Opatrný.
The coupon is automatically checked by the driver instead of the driver.
The handling of machines that start their operations tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon previously paid will be gone by itself.
Electronic coupons are valid not only in the capital, but also in the area from tomorrow.
So on trains and buses around the city from 300 to 499, with residents travelling mainly to the capital of the city of Central Asia.
"In Prague's integrated trains, the tours were provided with card readers to determine the zone validity of the coupons," explained the verification of the lines by Dr. Philip Dralal of Ropid, an organisation that assembled the Prague Public Transport Agenda.
In buses around the city, card readers are integrated with the driver in the wallet.
At the time of take-off, the driver should not only show the chip card, but also the Opencard must be placed in the location specified on the side of the wallet.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"If, for example, the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way to ask the driver to do this is to add Dra to Dra's.
Passengers who travel by non-city busses and do not remember when their coupon is due will be able to return to self-service machines that save coupons on cards.
Information on the validity of their documents appears here on the display of the device.
The Soviets wanted a referendum on the US.
The Sudat Germans were asked to add the year 1945 to the United States of Šumava.
This is reflected in the letter that is in the collection of the scientific library in South Czech Republic.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under U.S. cartridges.
Some German groups of Sunett Germans claimed to be president of the United States in 1945.
This also turns out to be a private archived letter, which is currently kept in the collection of the South Czech Scientific Library.
The Germans in Česky Krumlov, in the letter, ask the President of the United States not to allow the re-entry to the Czech Republic of the 'Sumava County', which Hitler has already taken on the basis of the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly, and we really want to be sure in those words that American troops do not come to the German territories as either a tyrant or an enemy, but as a liberator," is in the letter, "Embers who bear the fate of Shemava", signed on their hearts.
Since attaching to Czechoslovakia is supposed to be for the Soviet Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national character - only to brutality, cruelty, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the author of the letter calls on the President of the United States to take over Šumava the patent "now and forever" over Šumava.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this area would be considered to be a foreign country for us, which will suppress and upset the minority, and it would almost not contribute to the victory of the allies," stands in the letter.
The reason the authors could not sign it is claimed to be fear of the revenge of the "silevers of abuse".
Therefore, if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Shaumava, it would be sufficient to consider a reference in the region of Shumava as to whether its inhabitants would want to become part of the United States and to live during the U.S. cartridges.
Although the text of the letter, in addition to current knowledge of postwar history, may seem somewhat naive, some historians correctly describe the expectations of the Sudeta Germans at the time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to have expected that they would be deported from the country, only a few of them had recognised this possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would agree on some kind of autonomy.
Others were confident that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
That is also confirmed by Gustav Chaulova, a Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalova served in the Baltic Sea as a German during the war in the form of Budějovici in Germany.
At the end of the war, when the British were captured and put into prison camp in Holštynskó, several dozen other Czech Germans came to teach them in Czech.
"They trusted that when they came back, they would be happy to have the Czech language," Chaluda said.
According to German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one believed that they would be deported on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You're not thinking - you're paying.
The emotional campaign attacks leaders.
In Czech history, the most expensive action is the safety of roads.
The emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday, could also be described.
From this campaign, Minister Aleš  - Abíček's office hopes that he will upset the leaders of the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be published on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
The drivers should be alarmed from speed and alcohol.
And you should remind them that their seatbelts are being locked in before they leave.
First of all, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians and not least would like to speak to the conscience of professional drivers.
And what appears in the commercials?
Emotional, mainly human stories.
This is also evidence of the "blood" logo of the whole campaign:
You're not thinking - you're paying.
The word "no think" is written on the license plate in large letters.
And there's the word "pay you" in the blood canopy.
This must mean that you can also pay for a moment's attention in life.
The viewers will be in the commercials until 2010 "freaked."
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the countries of England, where dramatic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
It is hoped that this will reduce the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech roads.
Ads were made by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, put it away for drivers.
"For drivers," pull it off, the system is valid.
"Let's give it to 'em, for example, when they go through red, they save time.
"Hold" is a danger of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Koñán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, which is considered a psychologist.
He thinks the driver's attention to the danger is less effective.
"If the risk warning board is fitted, it is likely that soon the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," warned Koña.
It would return almost all the occupied occupied areas in exchange for peace in exchange for peace and peace in exchange for peace.
Ehed Olmer, president of the provisional Israeli government, spoke about the restoration of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, namely from the west coast of Jordan, from East Jerusalem and from the Golan Uplands, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview, published on Monday by Jediot Achron on a daily basis.
"We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if we don't have to give back all (invased) areas," said Olmer on the agenda.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians have to pass a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem as well.
"Who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through the foot, as one of my best friends has done, has to give up part of Jerusalem," noted Olmer for the attack on two July cities in which some people were killed and some were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a unique solution to "the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places" in Old Town.
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
It won't work," he stressed.
The exit from the Golan Basin Conventions is an exit from the Golan Mountains.
He also commented on the withdrawal of Israelis from the Golan-fennsík, which, according to him, is an essential condition for the agreement with Syria to be concluded with Syria.
However, this would require a certain effort for Damascus, too.
"I do not recommend a peace settlement with Syria solely on the basis of an exit from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they have to cancel so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relations with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Síita movement); they must provide the regular support provided by Hamas (Síita movement), Al-Qaida and Dzishád (Sent War) to terrorism in Iraq," explained the Prime Minister.
Questions after an accident: Are passengers passengers in buses illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you don't have to walk in a long distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company, the question was whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus while travelling to Italy was raised.
"If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activities of the traveling agent are incompatible with the law on transport," says Karel Hanzelka, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, by the death of a twenty-two-year passenger guide, it is likely that the driver of the bus crosses the road of the bus was the driver of the truck.
The girl's misfortune was sitting next to the driver at the moment, the bus was in the least safe place, even though she had two more seats reserved for her.
The bus can crash or suddenly stop at the moment when the passenger guide is offering you coffee or a newspaper.
You have a certificate to use to determine whether the bus is based on a licence.
If the bus is not homologised, passengers should be seated.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no seats; they are also confirmed by the director of the company Aktualně.cz Radim Jančura.
"We have tried to find a solution to this ministry, and at first, passengers have not been allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have decided that passengers can go to a room during the journey, if they have their own meeting," said their position.
The law does not know the passenger guide.
"There is no clear legal rule on the role of a passenger guide - no legislation regulates this position.
However, no legislation prohibits the provision of services by the carrier.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a driver; its rights and obligations are not defined," added Hanselka the speaker less clearly".
On the contrary, Mr Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicle Management Division of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law properly addresses the problem.
"It depends on whether there is a seat on the bus's license.
And it's over," he says.
Buses may, according to their discrimination, be located in cities with maximum speeds and limited speeds and maximum permissible speeds between urban places and higher speeds, as well as long distances without seating positions and maximum permissible speed, with seat with seat belts.
As on the plane, the expert says the expert.
Jaroslav Hoørín, the BESIP Transport Safety Expert, does not see a major problem on board the bus when passenger escorts move.
"In the course of continuous progress, there are no risks, we can compare the situation to the service provided on the plane.
I'm not sure here when there's a tour and an air travel guide who can beat his head in."
"But if the bus suddenly brakees, of course its physical laws are valid.
The same as in city buses or trass.
The safety of passenger passengers must be solved by the carrier by internal rules," says and also believes that the problem for the law has not been resolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel services.
Student Agency offers passenger accompanying services as a single bus and coach carrier.
Two hundred passengers are employed.
The director does not treat his profession as a risk after the accident.
"But as I have the impression that the profession of passenger professionals is risky, I will stop it.
The coffee and the newspapers can be obtained by passengers when boarding.
That would be cost savings," he says.
It was justified by safety interests in its vehicles that the lack of passenger escorts was justified by Alexej Litvin, Director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared with Student Agency.
"We do not have passengers, we oppose this from the outset.
Sooner or later this will end with some kind of fatal injury," he said only a year ago to Týden.cz.cz.
An incredible tragedy happened.
The company’s two-year-old young passenger guide from Plzeň died during a journey in Naples.
The Slovenian truck is likely to be pulled out of the stopway without the use of direction indicator and has stopped the bus route.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to get out with a mayonnaise, but the right front of the bus hit the front of the bus.
The fact that two reserved places to rest passengers would have been sold is rejected by Jančura.
"This places on long distance flights cannot be booked, blocked."
The firm wants to sue the driver of the truck.
In order to compensate her daughter's family, the agency does not expect a court judgment, but it also expects financial compensation for the offence.
Amendment of the law?
In the distant future.
A change in the law on board the bus for more than a year could be made to clarify the movement of passengers by means of a crew of thirty experts working on the bus for more than one year from the Ministry of Transport.
"But the group did not achieve any concrete result.
Buses are not so much, rather the point system deals with the maximum permissible speed on the motorway and mobile usage during driving," says Hoørín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activities of passengers' escorts as something which would essentially threaten the safety of passengers," says Hanselka, the speaker, who concludes that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and the employment agencies.
The dysseldorf hopes are going through Frankfurt.
The letter to the bank’s employees by WestLB’s Board of Directors is not narrowing down in great words.
From the merger of the financial institutions indyseldorf and the Federal Bank of Deca-Bank in Frankfurt, 'the central capital market organisation of the savings fund group' could be created - write the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would put a permanently profitable "competition block" into a business like this.
Such a link could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the banking sector in the provinces.
This is the reading of a board wishing to prove its operational capacity in difficult times.
In fact, there remains considerable pressure on the uncertain WestLB bank.
It is not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which has recently been informed by the North Rhine-Westphalia Government that it limits the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, it has been a long time since the issue of a kind of relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB, known as the investment funds for savings customers, has also been on the Frankfurt section of the same relationship.
Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, reported that the bank in Mainzer Landstraße and a province bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not see any meaning.
Despite this, Deka's board of directors, one half of which is representatives of the Landesbanks and the other half of the savings coins alliances, entrusted the Executive Board with the task of continuing negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In that case, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be involved.
However, negotiations - the financial circles - have just begun.
With 3000 employees, the name of Deka-Bank, one of the most important employers of the financial sector in Frankfurt, is not the first time that there is a consolidation of the depository sector.
For a moment in 2003, the Deka-Bank seemed to be joining the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, none of this three alliances have turned out to be anything.
The plans were rarely published, and the government of the provinces had spoken against Helaba’s interest in it.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was taken to Baden-Württemberg, Stuttgarti Landesbank.
However, again and again, the idea of the relationship between the Deka-Bank and the Landesbanks was raised.
However, the last time Günther Merl, Chairman of the Helaba Board, called on the plans for mergers with his bank.
However, it is worth recognising that there is a need for convergence between the various banks in the various sectors of the sector.
Now, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected to be the first to meet in the region.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If further pressure on the hair is increasing, potential partners may slowly lose weight for them.
In South Germany, it would be only a younger partner, where the financial crisis has been significantly better overcome by now than the München and Stuttgarti banks.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out at the beginning of the year in Giroverband Hessen-Thüring, a 85% business associate in Helaba.
The NordLB is not the only one left.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other side, the question arises as to how different business models of individual banks are suited to each other.
In June, Merl stated that the German Securities and Trade Association has not yet answered the crucial question of what business model to ensure the future of sovereign banks.
It is possible to even copy WestLB, but they do not want it to be self-evident.
Thus, a letter from the Board of Directors says that they will definitely seek a "full solution".
How this compares with the merger of individual units with Deca-Ban, it is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Lasz weekend" of the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
Elena's the first time Luca's had the third or fourth time.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend and everything is different, says Luca.
Behind them, a man with a strong body-shaped beard is standing next to the Kaiser brand five-litre barrel and proves to be about 200 people travelling to Oktoberfestre that he can draw how deep sounds he can draw from his throat.
Elena first found Luca's face, then kissed her.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, four buses from the parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova Railway Station will depart at 23.45 at "destiazione Monaco, festa della" on the road, expected to arrive at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are held mainly for the Italians, the fourth is for the Brazilians to travel exclusively.
In one of the corners of the parking lot, South Americans have been singing songs by their flag, already during the night the celebration was started.
And so loudly that it's not for the Italians, he says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco with long, artificial-haired coats and wide silver-haired glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years, only three tours this year.
At night, during the day at Oktoberfest, at 22:30, he'll be home.
The accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The trip costs €75, which includes a welcome Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German-speaking tour - Marco Frankfurt, a German language course.
And they're already taking their busses into the night towards "Brennerro" on the highway.
No beer, not yet.
The bus is closing soon, the passengers are asleep.
All right, well, they'll need their strength more.
There is rest in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where on the 8th motorway a number of Italian buses are also taking a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwies, as planned, at 6:30 a.m., there are nearly 50 other buses from across Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding a final statement, presenting the war plan.
First, everybody put on the yellow cap.
On this left you can read the words "Oktoberfest" written on the left, next to Marco's travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the doors of the beerer are opened, run" says Marco in the morning.
"Get!" The reservation of seats in the back of the run and the back of the tent.
"Not forward, 'cause we're going to run away, and don't sit on the same pads with all the yellow hats, but spread out in the tent."
The 1-litre age costs EUR 8.25, which says Marco.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show the security guard that you're doing well.
As you leave your seats, they take them away!"
Third, "Be here again at 6:30 tonight!" You understand me?
And now we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one man travels with yellow hats as a sign to the trees, the tables, and even the election posters of one of the big Bajor People's Party.
We need to prepare for the retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Laszi weekend".
There are no exact figures; there are 50,000 people who cross the Alpokon in the beer tent, 10 percent of all visitors from the weekend are expected to arrive from Italy.
The Mincheni Police Police are strengthened by seven Southtirol police officers, Italian volunteers are helping the Bajor Red Cross, which, in its national statistics, has about 200 medical treatments, the Italians take the first place, preventing the Austrians (about 80) and the British (about 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofbräu beer maker was particularly fond of it.
Invisible nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors for Hypo Real Estate's loans to Hypo Real Estate.
The German banking system was relatively stable, and the Federal Minister of Finance of Peer Steinbrück stressed that it was only last week.
It is a good thing that the politician used the word "relatively" and even said that the German banking sector would not be spared the crisis-like developments.
Because this was happening this weekend.
Daxon's registered Munich Hypo Real Estate (HRE) has received a billion-dollar loan from the German banking consortium to protect itself against market fluctuations.
A person who knows the situation told Reuters that the loan subsidies would be worth EUR 35 billion on Monday.
Hypo Real Estate must pay interest only on the part used.
The money comes from partly private and partly public banks.
In the background, Depfa’s subsidiary has lost its position.
Depfa, a newspaper reports that he borrowed money for long-term projects, and he refinanced himself for these extremely short term periods - which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash balance decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2,37 million, and the share of equity also decreased moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent in the first half of 2008.
Net revenue from current revenue and cash transactions fell to zero from the same period of the previous year, revenue from credit claims and fixed securities, as well as from the liquidation of the target assets of the credit business decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex-depfa Group’s ex-post accounting costs and the reimbursement of interest on the basis of the tax rate and the transactions for companies belonging to the group, the revenue deficit of 16 % was relatively moderate.
After privatising in 1990, the former sovereign financiator first specialized with corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently segregated in Aeral Bank.
Since there was little access to classical public funding, Depfa has made itself more intensively involved in infrastructure projects, as well as in joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-public partnership, PPP), and has broadened its activities internationally.
The value of subsidiaries is now subject to a description of Hypo Real Estate that has a "essential effect" to show the group's results - it has been reported quite generally.
In fact, no dividends were paid.
The dividends have already been reduced to the third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a significant public and infrastructure investor since Depfa's acquisition.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on inter-bank market refinancing as it does not have client deposits.
With the collapse of the US Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the transfer of banks to each other was suspended because banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets to refinance part of the Depfa credit portfolio for some EUR 50 billion a year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the Group's funding needs are covered for a period of time with the loan, and the company's protected "from the impact of highly inefficient international financial markets currently."
According to other sources, the funding is provided by the end of 2009 thanks to the funds.
On the other hand, Mr Funke, the Chairman of the Executive Board of the HR stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to make use of the financial markets for a long time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate group is now secure.
This gives hope to the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamics and incontrovertities of the crisis, there are certain things that cannot be found in it.
It is not even impossible to have full access to funding.
However, the opposite of this cannot be ruled out.
After the news on Saturday late evening, the bank was still at the edge of the bankruptcy, yet the temporary rescue of the equal was not able to reassure the wagers.
The share price decreased by 75 per cent to EUR 3.30 per cent.
On the other hand, the bond rates are fairly well maintained.
While the initial debt is barely changing, the reversed bond exchange rates are significantly downwards.
In particular, the crisis affects the obligations of the former subsidiary, Württemberg Hypo and possibly the durations beyond 2009 onwards.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds appeared to be an ex-ante investment alternative, their value is now deemed to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system, and given the fact that the financial institution took the crisis almost to the house by taking Depfa into account.
As long as the bond banks, governments and less threatened business banks are still ready to support the system, the cancellation of the benefits can be started from the deadline.
Or what happens at present is that almost nobody dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, the partial state-related reports show that there is a limited likelihood of certainty now that it has only been financed by legitimate remand.
For long-term creditors, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to separate them from their investment.
However, short-term investors may make use of sales to provide reserve for taxes payable on the exchange rates for the coming years.
Confidentials of Sylvana and of the incubators
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop needs to show up at the Tachibana High School on his first day of teaching, girls start to hover: The German girl is totally "vaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word about mango - about Japan in the new exchanges and blogs about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was on my way to school.
I live on the edge of the river, heading towards the Kava, and I travel 40 minutes on a train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, and luckily I wasn't wrong.
It seems that the beginning of the teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as home in Lower Estonia.
The students start to scream at eight o'clock, until a short conversation starts at 8:00 p.m., with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the teaching began, I was on my way to introduce myself.
But I'm not the type who's willing to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform, I picked up an old skirt of my roommate's, and she's wearing shirts, blue knees, and black leather shoes.
So I was in this dress in front of your tape, and I was trying to say everything correctly: "Good morning, vo se Sylvana..." "I came to Sylvana, Germany, and my birthday will be in a week's time.
At this moment, I was very happy that I began to learn language for two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, snooping and screaming, and I kept hearing the word "wave".
I've known that from my men before.
It belongs to the Japanese girls' basic vocabulary, and it means " cute, sweet."
And then I ran to my place.
The girl next to me smiled greatly, and it was a privilege to have the exchange students planted her next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the bell came out, they ran normally.
Everyone spoke and laughed, and with their questions, they drilled a hole in my belly - and it is rather difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
At the break, everyone then packed his shirt out.
My guest made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwich.
I got spiced rice, some sausages, pasta and pasta salad, fruit and some kind of tofu meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Foods look strange and have a completely innovative taste.
In fact, it's all very good.
Yeah, well, maybe with the exception of salt-smelling, brorr.
In Japanese schools, the curse is not only just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy an e-mail with her own hands, especially an artist, in the hope that he can get closer to the boy at lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can watch this here too.
"Why is Japan?" they asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause he's just enchanted.'
After all, I've been reading mangoes for years.
And to understand the comic books and the culture they describe more, I began to learn Japanese sometime.
It was clear to me, then, that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these are very generous here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand it is a strict, disciplined and traditional one.
And since everything was so well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
In rats, too, they have emotions.
Does that mean that you feel fear?
Joseph LeDoux neurologist is convinced: Animals also have emotions.
But how can we examine if they feel the same way when they behave like us?
For years, famous scientists have published their articles in the "Edge" Internet magazine.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of his series, "What does it mean to be real without being able to prove it?" he looks at the answers to the question.
I believe that animals have emotions and other state of consciousness, without me or anyone else able to prove this to them, but it is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of all human brain is the same.
However, as we look at other species, and in general, we will disintegrate the questions of consciousness, which are difficult to reach, as hardware does not match.
When a rat gets in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: He pretends to be dead, run or attack.
People behave in a similar way, resulting from comparative subjective experience by some researchers.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult for us to carry our own subjective experiences through the animal field.
Human consciousness-related circuits are almost always included in the lateral pre-oral mindset (due to its role in the short memory and implementation/control function).
This wide area is more advanced for humans than for other main mammals, and it seems that there is a complete lack of human resources.
At least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the pre-frontal brain cancer, such as knowing who we are or, if we are planning and decision-making skills, it is reasonable to assume that man is different from other main mammals.
Another dramatic feature lies in the language nature of man: Because a large part of human experience is related to the language, they often claim that it depends on consciousness.
In that case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it does not depend on the language, the language would certainly be influenced by it, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, is likely to differ strongly from most of our state of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what knowledge might be like for other animals.
If consciousness is not measurable as an internal and subjective thing, and due to the specific hardware, it cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experience, then we are facing serious problems in our research.
Most of my ideas are about the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is likely to be easily accessible to science.
The knowledge processes of animals could be examined independently of the content of the animals, and that is exactly what happens in experiments for short-term memory of the main mammals, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in the assumption that Christof Koch and Francis Crick are more based on the nerve contexts of consciousness than on the chasal mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Obviously, this assumption also highlights the importance of a pre-frontal brain cancer in the development of visualisation.
What about emotions?
This is driven by the fact that an emotional system, such as fear, is active in a brain known to its own activity.
What we refer to as "in fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity (or consequences of the protection system in the brain, such as physical reactions) is involved in working memory.
As a result, emotions are closely linked to the areas of the brain that are characteristic of the main mammals and especially human beings.
In addition to the linguistic nature, sense is divided into subtle degrees, because by means of words and language, we are able to distinguish and categorize situations in order to describe them to others themselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio believes that emotions are derived from simpler activities in the body areas of brain cancer and brain stem, as well as from Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it can easily play a role in species in comprehensive emotions.
Obviously, I can't deny it, but I think it's unproven.
Pankseep considers that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt in both cases: How can rats and humans check if they feel the same way when they behave similarly?
A boat escape in the event of danger, does he feel fear too?
In my opinion, only similar behaviour is not yet evidence of the same experience.
Although negative interaction helps further: rats and humans are similar to brain fractures, boats have no brain.
But the brain testor is responsible for emotions?
And even if this could be proved for humans, how can we prove this to rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are thought to be essentially different from theirs (as human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I am looking for the emotional behavior of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is a glamorous exercise at a neutral level if the same measure is used in rats and humans.
As for rats, I don't study language and consciousness, I don't know if I know if they exist.
For others, this may seem a short-looking attitude, but I am moving forward rather than constantly running into a wall.

Platini, President of UEFA: Time of grace to Poland and Ukraine.
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasszjunik, Ukrainian Prime Minister, has announced that the preparations will shortly be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees confidence in Ukraine in the decision of UEFA Bordeaux and the evidence of their belief in Ukraine's ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland," said Vaszjunik.
"But this does not mean an anesthetic for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is much to be done in both countries."
Both catering countries are missing for the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste more time.
We have to work with the police right now", said Grigorij Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Labda Kick Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, you have been planned to take a more radical step forward.
Following a number of scandals, the National Olympic Commission suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN Federation, which was replaced by independent inspector Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met at the initiative of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki's Minister of Sport.
There is a serious risk that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have assured Michel Platinum, President of UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparations of the 2012 EB."
Only in the last year had to be classified into the lower class due to manipulation, and finally, it had to be delayed.
The enererered Dennis Quaid is going to strike back back on the deranged Dennis Quid.
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, talk about her privacy in the interview, and now she's in trouble with her ex-husband, and Ryan's star, Hollywood, classified her former husband Dennis Quadid as a adult.
Those who milk - and beat him back and cut him back.
Late rose war with Meg Ryan - Dennis Quad ex married: The two Hollywood actors seven years after their divorce are fighting a bad fight - before the public.
In an interview with Ryan in the American InStyle magazine last week, he spoke about the reasons for divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, with a lot of pain."
And after she got divorced, she found out how many women Dennis cheated on her.
The spiritual stripper Ryan's new press work on "The Women" film has been done, which tells the story of a adultery.
"The 54-year-old actor said to "New York Daily News", "To make it unsuspectable to repeat and pass the story of our relationship."
In addition, "I'm sorry" that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, repeating again, are obviously reminded of many pains and changes caused by divorce to a child."
While Ryan has been living alone since his divorce, Quaid has been married again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
The answer therefore ends with the following side cut: "My life is going to continue anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is best in order."
Prices of tickets and hotel rooms are reduced by less prices for tickets and hotel rates.
In the first half of 2008, European airports and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany have become less than 50% cheaper than those in Germany.
The prices of airports and hotel rooms have again been more favourable than that of American Express travel and financial service providers.
The company analysed the first half-year booking data and, after the first quarter price increase, established a significant price drop in the second quarter of the second quarter.
After price increases in the hotel market for many years, accommodation has become much cheaper than it has been.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities examined increased on average by 6.9 per cent from 2007 to 2007.
However, for the period from April to June, prices were already 3,6 % lower than in the previous year.
This trend was clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than one year earlier.
For this reason, the American Express sees it at a low price in the dollar, which led to "the American tourists in the way of travelling".
The fall in hotel rates is more affected by financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hanovert, Kölnt or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, a 26.3% increase in hotel prices is considered a European record.
There was also a growing change in the prices of flights during the first quarter.
As a result of kerosene decline, passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more in the tourist class than in 2007, and long-term flights of high fuel demand were reduced by 29.2%.
Between April and June the prices of tourist-class flights decreased by 12,5 per cent on average from the previous quarter, however, in business and first-class prices showed only a significantly lower trend.
In Germany prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March prices increased by 11.9 per cent and decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The cost of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half according to the study.
On the one hand, the fall in prices is due to a moderate economic growth - claims by the company.
In many segments of the flight market, demand declined in many segments.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, will increase the pressure on the competitive situation.
The tense situation is demonstrated by the fact that airlines will cancel their losses and that in the first half of 2008, several airlines reported bankruptcy - it only affects 24 airlines in Europe.
The HSV 1:0 beats Gladbachot to the HSV 1:0.
A goal and simple methods were put at the head of the tabella at the Hamburger SV.
At Borussia Luhukay's, he's still unable to find the working team.
Christopher Klein magnification Deep flying for the national selected Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only late in the game, and the lift returned from the hood.
His exact message was sure to leave his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal" - síszte Hermann Rieger in the corridor leading to the cabins of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much has happened in the cathouses, the break has ended, and most of them have been sitting in their seats again.
Rieger had HSV's physical therapist for almost three decades, with a greater dignity than some of the bending players.
He thus found a hearing at the competent place of the hearing.
Cornelius Jol's assistant was snooping, and he agreedly showed his thumb.
Cornelius is the leader of Hamburg, Martin Jol's brother.
His command could have been similar to that of the second goal.
The execution of the command is missing.
"It wasn't always a pretty sight today" - admitted later by Marcel Jansen.
You know, I was like, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
The 1: 0 (1: 0) is the result thanks to the head of the Hamburgers Mladen Petric (11.); and to the fact that the very weak Gladbachas were unable to cause pain to the weak burgers.
"It was a dirty victory" - he made a statement by Martin Jol.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 on Monday.
The viewers have celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena, and the table on the outskirts, which presented their team as the Head of the Championship.
This is going to be a partyless birthday.
"We know where to put it" said Marcel Jansen.
The fact that the intermediate certificate of the tabella is more than an indication of the predictability of the league rather than of the dominant position of the HSV.
Although the team's late commitment to the acquisitions of the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the capus Petric and the Jansen acquired from FC Bayern, it slowly finds you, but it doesn't.
"We need more sense and attachment" - said Jol.

However, the amount is not to be paid at the same time, but to be paid gradually.
In exchange, the State would receive orders for shares of financial institutions, which would be accepted if the exchange rates were to be adjusted accordingly, reducing the burden on the state's portfolio.
European and American US and US stock exchange rates are at the end of the fallout.

Dark material affects the flight of space probes.
For years there has been a mysterious phenomenon that has been undermining researchers. The dark matter affects the speed of space probes throughout the so-called swing-by major.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The Ulysses space shuttle flew for nearly 18 years in space.
Soon, due to frozen fuel pipelines, the ice cream is threatening to die.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon, a swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means the gravitational price version of space probes, where they generate additional momentum in a celestial area such as Earth gravity space.
Thus probes can save a large amount of fuel.
As with the Ulysses sun probe, the European American Researcher Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick.
But what we've been looking at for years is that the flying objects don't behave completely as expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, there are abnormalities in speed.
The probes suddenly speed up or slow down.
The Physics have so far found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized to swing-by anomaly.
Some experts are concerned that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct, which takes the mass draw of the material into the shape of space.
He continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong, and that swing-by anomaly is trying to explain it with the so-called dark matter that the astronauts discovered in the universe.
"The anomaly can be responsible for the dark matter, which may even be found anywhere near the Earth," says Adler.
Space Researchers have only found out about the existence of dark material for ten years.
Obviously, it is a gravitational force that can be observed for its effects on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, in particular it does not release or restore visible light.
According to scientists, a good one-tenth of the total mass of the universe is made up of dark matter.
Tourists who have been kidnapped by tourists in Egypt have been freed from the liberation of tourists who were kidnapped by tourists in Egypt.
After having spent ten days in prison for their kidnappers, tourists in Egypt are once again free - the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed.
Sudanese kidnappers have charged millions of euros of ransom prizes.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, six hostages reportedly lost their lives.
In South Egypt, five German citizens were kidnapped.
The ransom negotiations are already ongoing.
Germans again and again become targets for kidnappers.
WELTALLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists are free in the Sahara.
This has been reported unanimously for Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arabic television and Italian media.
According to the reports from the Italian Sky TG 24 television, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact that the release was made: "Our fellows and the rest of the hostages were released.
We're currently examining their health status," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian national and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and sound - reported the Egyptian state television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages release are still clouded: According to an Egyptian Security Officer, the hostages have shown their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese military surprisely killed them.
"The problem has been solved.
They accepted the ransom," said the official.
"We were only talking about taking hostages," when suddenly, "the surprise happened."
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday, in the border region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, six kidnappers were shot and two were arrested.
The hostages claimed a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been passed on to one of the German wives of the hostages.
The "al-Masri al-Jom" newspaper, referring to a German broker, has reported that the release of hostages is being withdrawn because the kidnappers are concerned about their own integrity.
According to the report, hostages will release women's hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men are being held by kidnappers until safe escape routes are found.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a job with regard to the report.
"The violence led to a suicide" was violence committed by stepfather violence.
In court it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepdad raped her for years.
He spent six years in prison in Stithians, a 57-year-old in Cornwall County, once a confession of his eight-year-old Michael Trerise's attempt to talk about the eight-year-old rape.
The Truro Criminal Court has found out that he regularly committed his stepmother, Stephanie Randle between the five and seven years of age.
In a statement by Trevor, he wrote, "I feel like I'm sorry for her death."
The trial stated that Randle committed suicide at a home in Mutley's quarter of Plymouth town at 34 on 1 April 2007.
When he was living in Coventry as a kid, Trevor tied up his eyes and closed his eyes in front of the coronations while his mother was working in a beer beer.
Trerese was divorced from his wife in the 1980s and once again he chose Cornwall.
Mostonánya moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turns out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer for the National Trust monumental organization, was persecuted by the nightmares of violence twice a week.
In 2006 D.C. Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to have a passion for surfing and biking, said her friends said "emotional dead" and "devil about life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr Randle's daughter's stepdad, whose statement in letter ended: "I kept bound and bound his eyes.
I wasn't sexually upset.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're a very strange fetist, and I'm sure it was terrible for her victim, especially if she was seven years old.
This awkward family novel ended up killing the victim himself.
However, the fact that, if you don't do that, the case may never have been brought to trial."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the impact that Stephanie's parents felt on their daughter of the crime you committed over the years.
If this hadn't happened, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
An official who lost important data was accused of being charged with the prosecution of the Office that lost the important data.
According to BBC's reports, in violation of official secrecy, the government official who forgot strictly classified documents on a train in June was charged with a criminal offence.
The male experts were posted from the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were sent to the police.
This is the simplest accusation of a violation of the law, and there is no suspicion of deliberate conduct.
Frank Gardner, a report from the BBC Department of Defence, says that the move surprised many people in Whitehall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the Government would handle the case as an internal matter," said he.
A staff member who cannot be appointed has been charged under point 8.1 of the Law, and this paragraph concerns the preservation of information.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has suggested that the prosecution against the Office be represented by Metropolitan Police as a man for his work of a fairly sensitive nature in relation to the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents that he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
On Monday they informed me of the decision and then moved him to a place unknown from his home.
Homebuilding cooperatives pay their B&amp;B account.
Britain's homebuilding cooperatives can account for an amount of more than 80 million English dollars after the rescue of Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent $14.6 million on the protection of its deposits with Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all the companies that use depositors' money, including 59 housing-building cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, Chairman of the Association of Home Builders (BSA), Adrian Coles says that companies and members have to pay for it.
After the repayment of the 14 billion important loan, it will be possible to repay the Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgage.
However, the interest accruing in the meantime can be charged annually to the 700 financial corporations that use the loans.
The Financial Services Management System has confirmed to the BBC that 59 apartment building associations are also one of them.
It is annoying that the institutions that have been acting with caution should now pay the accounts of the institutions which have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We've learned that all companies have to pay the amount of deposit that they have in possession, and that the companies share 18% of the costs between them.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to put 81 million pounds aside to pay the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, director of the union of housing companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is alarming that institutions must pay the accounts of less prudent institutions, which have taken care of the recovery of the housing market."
According to BSA, none of the companies broke up since 1945.
"In all respects, we have to look at this case for the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant account," said Cole.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, it will have to pay a total annual interest rate, which can be twice the previous two.
As housing cooperatives are self-assisted entities, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the account, either at higher fees or at lower interest rates after deposits.
The price of milk is rising by fivepence per litre per litre by fivep per litre.
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The dairy company in Jersey has announced that it will increase the wholesale milk price by more than fivepence per litre from Monday.
This year, this second price increase has been due to the rise in twopences in February and after a review by an advisory firm.
The resellers themselves decide whether to pass on the price increase on to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price for milk in Jersey changed last in 2002 for milk.
They rejected the request of a former MP from Bangladesh in order to be able to defend me freely.
The Government of Bangladesh has refused its application for the protection of Sheikh Hasina's former MP, which means that he may be arrested when he returns to the country.
Your lawyer told me that the court refused to defend him on the grounds that 50 million tats were blackmailed by a businessman at the time of his parliamentary representative (729,700 dollars).
This case is only one of the countless charges of corruption brought against it.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Ziat was released for bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, Awami League, demands that the temporary government supported by the country's army give her full freedom first.
According to the reports, although he was conditionally released to go abroad for treatment, it is not clear from the conditions of free foot placement that he could retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Board of Appeal.
"The Board of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail that it is not necessary, as it has been temporarily placed on free foot and taking part in foreign medical treatment," said Rafique and Huq's lawyer.
"We'll be more inclined against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyers, he needs protection in order to return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
On Sunday, one of the leaders of the Awami League Party told us that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th.
Last year, a temporary government supported by the army took over power, but in June it was released from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges brought against them.
concerns about the vaccination programme against Afghanistanpolio in Afghanistan on the issue of concerns regarding the vaccination programme for the protection of Afghanistan police in the context of the Afghan-related programme for the protection of against the Afghan-con relating to violence against po poo vaccination in Afghanistan.
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been left out of the recently organised polio vaccination programme for Taliban violence.
Last week, vaccination measures have been organised in six United Nations provinces.
However, they said that for safety reasons they could not reach children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar, south of the city.
According to a UN speaker, this happened despite the Taliban promise: they will not attack or stop the work of thousands of staff who have been vaccinated.
BBSkyB’s appeal concerning ITV was rejected against the complaint concerning BSkyB concerning ITV.
BskyB has refused to appeal against the decision of the Competition Committee which instructed it to reduce its interest in the rival TV on ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its participation from 17.9% to 7.5% in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
Earlier, the Committee has decided that BSkyB’s share is a barrier to competition and gives the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 and this effectively prevented NTL from being replaced by Virgin Media in the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that BSkyB’s acquired stake in ITV undermines the independence of ITV by encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The Director of the Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervision all opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of ITV’s share in the form of an ambiguity - in particular that BSkyB has stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the US US Public Prosecutor's case.
U.S. Attorney General has appointed a Special Prosecutor for the investigation of the loss of nine US US US prosecutors in 2006.
The move followed the criticism of the decisions of government officials by the Chief Justice Inspector of the Judicial Chamber of Justice of the case.
The report was judged by the officials of the White House, the legislators and former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was a fear that the prosecutors were lost from political considerations.
Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor, will now investigate whether the officials who have been heard during the investigation have tried to prevent justice by lying.
"The serious accusations relating to potential crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified", says Inspector Glenn Fine, Chief Inspector.
One of the main proposals was to appoint a Special Prosecutor, who was empowered to make a statement of the witnesses.
The series began with nine prosecutors from the US Attorney General's Office of Justice removed in December 2006 from his mandate in December 2006.
At that time, they said that the prosecutors were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it was later discovered that the state's attorneys had nothing worse than many other colleagues, and so many of them came to the conclusion that there was a political reflection behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors participated in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican Congress Members, while others refused to take part in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating the government's orders and investigating court cases.
They can be lost at any time, but for political reasons they cannot be removed from their position.
The then head of the jurisprudence, the state's attorney Alberto Gonzales, became a target for the losses and finally resigned.
A number of other officials in the judicial database have also given up their resignation.
In his report, Inspector Gonzales has greatly judged his role in the case. He said that the US Attorney is "primary responsibility" on the role of delegation, "developed" leadership, and "he's taken himself out" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, were judged by the former assistant of Bush, who had not shown any cooperation during the investigation.
Meat Loaf is awarded the award of the epossa of Meat Loaf.
The rock star Meat Loaf will be recognised for his epic hymnous song at Q Awards Awards.
The singer who takes over his special golden prize at the London Festival next week said he would honor the honor of honour.
The nine-minute 50-second long song was a song called the album of Meat Loaf in 1977, the album of the Arco album of the audience concert.
Coldplay received most of the entries for this year's awards, and they were listed in four categories.
Paules, editor of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" like that."
The song that Jim Steinman made was a very big voice, and that sound was Meat Loafé.
The song started with almost two minutes of instrumenting.
He showed up as a drive-by in 1979, and he got to the 15th place in the hit-and-run rangers.
However, the album of Meat Loaf "Bat Out Of Hell" has been present for almost nine years in the hit list, and then more than 40 million copies have been sold from it.
Meat Loaf - his real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently had medical problems. Among other things, in 2003, he had surgery after he fell on the stage because of his heart rhythm disorder.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute neuritis.
Turns out there's a cyst on his voice.
Unknown city street, which is often forgotten and may be sold soon.
New York City has thousands of highways, tours and other sidewalks, some of which are famous, others perform purely practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and a local person who has long been living here find it hard to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it before.
The small street is in East Village, heading north from the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and more similar to a dusty alley than a main route of transport.
There are no street boards.
Technically, you cannot find it on a standard map.
However, the street has wonders.
There it is, for example, Avalon Bay, the building of the recently built First Street luxury building.
He wants to go back to Extra Place, and he wants to make sure that he can get to the shops and butiks of new buildings on a cleaner path.
The wonders of the street include the neighbors who lived here long ago who were caught in the knucklehead that was the only remains from the past of the area's renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the building and construction department of the city should not insist on it.
In this month, at a meeting of the Regional Management Committee of the district municipality, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer the street to be managed by the city and asked for a new plan for the next month, reported Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the municipal council No. 3, reports to Susan Stetzer.
"There are very few areas left in the city, and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"There may be proposals for the renewal and management of renovations that Aval may make, but we also want to ensure that it is available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to re-lease the small street and he wants to have seats. These would use part of a coffee shop, which the builder would expect to rent a property.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this monthly meeting.
Michele de Milly, spoke by Avalon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, it does not insist on its possession.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this lauded alley and turn it into a pleasant public novel", adding that the city proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, spoke by the Department of Construction Protection, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for building development and not for handling it.
Compared to Bowery, Extra Place doesn't have much historical significance.
According to some, in 1802, he received the name 'senki land' when Philip Minthorne's great possession was divided among countless children, and no one on the narrow strip was required.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the back of the CBGB was opened on Extra Place, and the street might be the most likely that a photo was taken there on the album of Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a fair spot", said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who took the photo in November 1976.
"You've had garbage, clothespans, barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how the middle class East Village owned, are opposed to the sale of Extra Place. They argue that it must remain in the community of this piece of public property, as modest as it is, of course.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare, which is a practically unchanged piece of the city, and which must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, the author of the blog entitled “Siralmak’s Excellent New York” (Siralmak: a book entitled ‘Current Nostalgia’) wrote to his blog about the Extra Place which was published in the 'The New Yorker’ section of the "Varian Dictionary" series entitled 'The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, which is bound by rust, iron storage doors and spaint windows, and where one week the wind wears leaves in the channels."
The street, apart from some exceptions, looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street by the back door, which used to lead to CBGB, and now belongs to a high-priced clothing store in place.
It was a graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty, 0.75 gallon of beer bottle, lying next to a threw-in fresh paper paper paper.
Some walkers have said that they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think that you could use the renovation.
Fields said that he thought some people would underestimate the attraction of the street in its current state.
"I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, fair, and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on multilingual education: Continued exposure to the English language environment is a constant exposure to the English language environment.
In this section, the student's opinion on dual language education is discussed by Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher in California's studies and head of education research, is the "It's not as good as you think: Why do you need the middle class to have a school choice" book?
It is not easy to walk in favour of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
The proposals for Barack Obama's education include here too.
Obama campaigned "Afro-American and Spanish-Ajka students are much less likely to obtain diplomas than white students," and that is true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama's educational plan is explicitly supported, inter alia, by "trans-lingual multilingual education" for English learners.
However, for Obama, the question is whether its commitment to multilingual education, which places emphasis on school education in non-English, outweighs the interest in tackling major differences in performance.
Consider, for example, a general school for Sixth Street Prep in the eastern part of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school students have Spanish lips and low incomes.
More than one third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, learns English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state math exam.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders completed excellent English language and literature tests.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the instrument that Obama would prefer.
The Sixth Street places emphasis on repeating, training, continuous evaluation of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, says the school education principle of the English-educated students, "full integration" into the language environment.
The essence of the method of identification is the use of English language almost solely in teaching other subjects.
Mikkels, who opposes multilingual education, said: "We have found a huge success in walking into a classroom, he wouldn't notice who the student who came back from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It's going around," he said, "Ours is working."
Would Obama set out schools such as Sixth Street Prep before a significant number of other Spanish-jaced and English-language students as an example?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear to respond, but due to the education policy of its own party (the National Education Associations have long been in favour of multilingual education) and, given that it itself consistently stands with the dual language education itself, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants have to learn English, Obama has recently spoken to the issue with a little appreciation, when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "excessively English what it was" of law-making.
Instead, he said, "They should be able to speak Spanish for their children."
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between the results, you should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and taking them into account.
In economic terms, the price of oil fell steeply because of the renewed concerns about the economy, the price of oil fell at a low price.
On Monday, oil prices were at a low level because of the concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets in America will not be able to boost the economy.
The crude oil securities returned to $99.80 a.m. on the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices decreased by over $20 per barrel last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock exchange has been disrupting the financial mess on Wall Street and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price reached EUR 145.29 per barrel in July, at the beginning of this month, almost USD 90 per barrel was recovered before again falling under the influence of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, there was a renewed concern over investors even after the Congress leaders announced that they had been able to agree on the economic rescue action this weekend, which is the biggest in history.
The news has been shattered by the concerns that the financial crisis will not be over long.
On Monday, the government announced on Monday that Citigroup will buy up Wachovia Corporation's banking business.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially state the European financial consulate, Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, "it seems that the rescue operation has failed to make the stock exchange preferences."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods such as oil will also decrease.
"The future of the stock markets, interest rates and foreign exchange rates has become uncertain around the world", wrote Deutsche Bank as an analyst for investors.
"We think that the market in goods will never be avoided by "infested".
The biggest issue for the stock market is the extent to which the U.S. 's disease' is the whole world, especially China."
As a result of the slowing economic growth, oil consumption decreased, bank analysts lost their expectations for the next year by 20%, reducing their forecast for oil and gas prices for 2009 by 20%.
The team set up a record of the team's record with its second fourth Bravour in the second quarter.
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets field than anyone else in the defensive end position, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything before.
But then he watched the opening of the second quarter Sunday when Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds of the sky.
Brett Favre, quartback 12-yards touchdown pasta gave Laveranues Coles a perfect advance for a afternoon during which their cooperation inventively improved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown passports in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the halftime period.
"I wasn't sorry for the trouble," said Favre about all the pass given to Coles.
"Pokoli's a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other so far, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped the Cardinals' controller Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis in the cornerback position caught a bad shot and threw it back with 32 yards that got touchdown.
Eric Smith, he's been hit by a safe player in another pass, and he's got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to kick the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing match in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely 20-yards field was kicked, setting up the 34:0 results.
This was the best result that Jets has achieved in one quarter of the time.
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the esterist nature of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When they told him that both - in the third quarter, the Cardinals bought 21 points that the Jets didn't have one - Mangini said: "I have to tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third.
We got lots of points in a short time."
The rest of the Gebrselassie is about to break its own world record.
Etióp Haile Gebrselasssie again showed why many people consider it to be the best mid- and long-term driver who ever lived when he broke his world record in Berlin on Sunday.
With the victory of the comfortably flat track, Gebrselasssie improved 27 seconds in his previous 2:04:26 result, which he achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselasssie set up the 26th world record of his career in a wide range of areas where he won World Championships from 1500 meters to marathon in almost every long term, or had a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, which, looking back, may have proved to be too careful that air pollution would further worsen its asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect circumstances - in daytime, initially at 9 °C and at 13 °C - won by Gebrselassie on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes at 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the marathon was not started before, such as Gebrselasssie, and Paul Tergat from Kenya turned to the long term, the marathon record has decreased more than two minutes in the past decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 with a result of 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselasssie told the reporters that two of his legs were grazed two weeks ago, and he couldn't train for two weeks.
It's obvious that during the forced rest, he's fresh, and he's not rusty.
"I'm so happy for you," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started training again a week ago, and I had my doubts today, but it was finally all right."
He received some criticisms from Kenya, especially from the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia, that he uses too many tools during his competitions, usually avoids many world-famous marathons, he's being abandoned as though he's running on track and places world records before the competition spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselasssie's grandeur in the long term.
Gebrselassie reached the ground during 1:02:04.
Two farts in Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathhi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the stimulants got out.
Not much more than 4.8 miles before the target Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last sprint, who reached second target 2:05:36, 5 minutes in repairing individual best.
Kamathi entered third place during 2:07:48.
In the female contest Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who now has a German national, has closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest year of victory at 2:19:19.
The world fair is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London marathon with a result of 2:24:14.
He couldn't have been involved in his alleged back injury on the Beijing Olympic Olympics, but he quickly recovered and won the Berlin marathon, where he fixed the five minutes individual summit.
He won the race with a smart count: first he allowed the Ethiopians and the Kenyans to advance a group of four people, and he would take a major lead, and then after about 30 km after they ran off.
The Etióp Askale Tafa Magarsa has reached the finish line with 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kinya became the third result 2:25:01.
A separate city, black pride and trials.
In the experience park at Greater Orleans - a few miles away from everything that is glittering, loud and powerful - there is a quiet small town where the pride and frustrations of African American life were born.
Eatonville, the first pure black town that integrated into the country, which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is now not as simple as it was described in 1935 as "the five lakes, three croquetts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimsuits, lots of guanas and two schools without prison."
Now it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the Zora Festival every year, which is honoured by Hurston, the most famous female writer of Harlem renaissance.
However, in many respects, the city that it has described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guide book issued by the Project of the Federal Letters of the Age of Change, separate from its surroundings.
The same independent, dignity-rich and lock-up as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that Florida, city blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who "so few of us know that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the Black President, Barack Obama, encouraged an open exchange of views on racial issues, there are many untrustful people here about the sight of the outsiders.
"We are looking forward to how to tell our story", the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life, and a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to tell me so badly."
Eatonville has long been marked by the victory and the fight with the paradox.
At the same time, the historically important model of black withdrawal is a community of almost 2400 people, where poverty indicators reach double national average.
Part of the literature node, partly as a result of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes with praise, Southern, Urban, Black Culture, which is flourishing in the shadow of oak trees.
So it's not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective at the same time.
And the picture of Eatonville is important since Zora, (that's what everyone calls Hurston).
In his genuine, strong dialected books - like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes We Working God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida Roadbook have transformed the city, which is next to the 17th Road. This road leads from Florida's long-awaited center to one of the locations of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature as well as drums, introduced his readers into the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "We find modern public schools right from the road, brown-based white-street, well-managed with courts and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares about, although he can hardly write and read."
He mentioned Dash's new husband of the widow, and he wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks, and whatever it takes in temporary accommodation."
A few hundred of these raised Hurston's connections with Eatonville's autonomy, but at the same time, it's about infidelity, remorse and sex.
Obviously, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really didn't like everyone.
"Zora told me things like they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls.
He said, "This some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered as the Elven Special, who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston walked into town, he usually arrived without notice in Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and in long-terms in a town where even today people were proud of their decent dress.
Most people were fascinated by it, Franklin said, but many of them were filthed.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," Franklin told me.
However, on the terrace on the lake of Sabela, where Hurston was most likely baptized, in his chair he added: "It was too long left."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer published again.
It seemed that much of the world, along with Eaton, forgot about him too.
Although he was a popular writer, along with Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he lived before.
There were no significant reminders or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood how much he enriched the world, or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the book Hurston, published in 2003, entitled "The Book "The Book of Infanted In The Sky".
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of the county of Orange wanted to build a five-way route through the city over the two-way main road instead of the Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orleans has already entered the States with interstate 4 motorways on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still walking after a difficult historic period.
Among other things, forced integration brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fights related to racial confusion tasted hatred with the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys came across, and they threw seats at the side of the road with oranges and other things," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a crucifix out of a car."
In his letter to the newspaper "The Orlando Sentinel", Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court on the pre-employment of violent integration.
Today, the residents say that the degeneration of schools in some respects was positive, weakened the unity of the Eatonvilles and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black kids used to kill them - that's what I remember - man was hugging his teacher in the morning and the evening" - reported N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, managing director of the nonprofit organization "We want to protect the community of Eatonville".
"It lasted until the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Nathiri.
However, human rights helped to raise many others in Zora Neale Hurston - in black writers, actors and artists who have overcome prejudices, as he did, with a remarkable confidence and series as follows: "How can anyone deprive themselves of my company's enjoyment.
This is inexplicable to me."
In 1975 Alice Walker eluded me to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to give her reputation back.
Five years later, a Robert E. Hemenway written by Hemenway took the shelf of bookstores, which once again raised him among American role models.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter was back at the center of attention.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston saw him as a savior.
In 1988 the community started organising a Hurston festival to show us what it would destroy the county with its main roadline.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later, and many have since been returning to the ceremony every January.
A few years later, the county withdrew from its proposal for a road trip.
"The community's relived, connected to full speed, which means genuine civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
There was an increasing number of people outside the city, such as Rachelle Munson's lawyer, who started coming to church in 1993, and the locals began to revalue the past.
Eatonville entered the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one level library (named naturally Hurston) opened up on Kennedy Avenue, which was reclassified and built in 2006.
Eatonville continues to have the cake-porch of Florida: it is not only about 10 km from Orlando center, but sometimes it feels like a suburban sidewalk is during summer rain; it is as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s by 27 black families.
(Today, 90% of residents are black.)
They're still taking care of the outsiders who come here looking for something to say about Eatonville's history.
A prior authorisation is required for most interviews, and some things such as the oldest fresco in Eatonville, which is painted by a white man and the blacks on earth, should not be photographed.
In Eatonville many, including confident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to live red, fear that their separate community is wrong.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival became increasingly widespread, the pride of the hometown has increased without a woman.
In particular, young people are increasingly regarded as Eatonville as having seen Hurston's own tree: neither better nor worse, less proud, as creative, creative, suffocated, foolish, nor confused than other racial or ethnic groups in America.
It's a genuine civil bond between Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18-year-old, who plans to return to the local government or the police to work for help after college.
And it seems the younger ones have learnt the correct character of Eatonville, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel here think that this town is nothing compared to the rest" said Alondra Kenon recently after the service of worship on Sunday.
"But if someone stops and wants a little time to get to know his history, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we all speak the language of finances.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists didn't care about the news market band and the huge TV monitors on Times Square, I wouldn't notice that a storm is in the middle of it.
They would never know that with their heads over their heads the bankers and risk fund managers who have held New York in their power have lived the hardest days since 1929.
The runners are still rolling their metal tea trucks on the roads, delivering trays with muffins for the morning meetings.
There are still men with Spanish lips in the blocks, carrying 50 or more of them as human mules, hanging in a loop of ows like their shoulders.
The office workers are still in line for their morning sweet bakery at the food cars on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 a day.
I didn't feel that there would be any crisis situation until Thursday afternoon despite all the alarm news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
I planned to handle this issue in the local account of JP Morgan Chase at the time of the afternoon's rest, but there were about 20 people in front of me in front of me.
Not at the bank money window, where money can be hired or paid, but at the customer's desk where older customers order a checkbook, tourists are asking for directions to the Macy's store and where new customers open a bank account.
Many before me, I learned from Starr, the "my ordered" banker, they were in line with the same purpose as me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks at their home, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from so-called savings banks (like housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives, and small-town savings deposits that operate only in a single state and are allegedly treating their clients as family members.
In the past year, 15 such banks have been silently destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $27 billion, has been under bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers started home by the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, a bank with a saving of USD 440 billion.
In front of me, office and shop employees, afraid of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed safe to escape, to the bank that makes most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
Simple New York people have been becoming an expert in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman in the local Chinese store spoke on her phone about Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she complained about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, he's changed the subject of a uniform, 50-year-old, not Brad and Angelina, or my food shipment, as we used to do.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my saved money in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not risking."
Musulman's graves were shattering while Austria's left-hand side of the keyboard
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the right-hand Austrian Party, and Philip Dewinter, from the Belgian Right Party, Vlaams Belang, took part in a protest in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, on Thursday, 17 January 2008, which was presented by the organization called "Islam Remembrance Against".
There were signs of signs of a traffic sign that portrayed flaws drawn through a red line.
According to the police, the extremes on the extreme right are responsible for the abuse of Australian Muslim funerals, which took place on the same weekend when the parties on the extreme right made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
There were more than 90 graves in the tragic cemetery next to Linz, sometimes between Friday evening and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as the David Star, on a few graves, but according to the investigators, they were simply trying to hide their extreme motives that stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in some way to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that "they were deeply depraved" after the hearing of the tears, which occurred just before the end of Ramadan, the Muslim religious month, just before the end of Ramadan.
At the same time, Austria's conscience is being examined after yesterday's parliamentary elections, where the political balance sheet language is straight to right.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which received nearly 30% of the votes, campaigned for the Freedom Party and the future of the Federal Republic of Austria, for a highly anti-immigration law, and stamped some of their logos as critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Committee on Freedom, which receives more than 18% of the votes, expressed a campaign against the heads and bulls and expressed a negative opinion on foods likely to be associated with Islam.
At the final Vienna Assembly, the party spoke about 'European Brotherhood', which would prevent the strengthening of Islam.
He wants both parties to prohibit the building of the Memorials and of you on the grounds that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islam of Austria and Europe.
According to the polls and analyses carried out following the elections that have led to the election of the extreme right, the change was largely due to the younger voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from travel abroad.
Garry Glitter, convicted of rape of children, is a well-known rock star from the court has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges then decided to ban Glitter for six months that he had informed him of his intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Kenti Police have obtained a ban on travel on Thursday after submitting evidence to the Court of Justice of the rape of violence against children against Glitter.
Glitter, the real name Paul Gadd, was not involved in the trial of Ashford Masters in the field, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday, 25 September, Kenti police submitted an application to the Ashford Masters Court to prevent Paul Gad from travelling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because it is the law applicable to those in the sex offender's register.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before the planned journey.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to imprisonment of five years.
The Kent Police told me that they don't want to talk about their specific cases within Glitter County and their possible whereabouts.
We found out from the speaker in the Kent police, "Kenti Police are doing everything they can to protect the children in the country and abroad.
"In our view, it is easier for someone to check if they do not leave the United Kingdom because there is a comprehensive system available to us to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The main role of the police in the field is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of persons who are registered for sexual crime and who live in the county in order to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after he spent 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for rape of a 10 and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to cross a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he was sick and refused to fly to London.
The foreign authorities did not pass the passport certificate, so they finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow them to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the foreign police and immigration agencies insisted that they return to Great Britain.
On 22 August he arrived at Heathrow Airport 3 terminal and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the court in West London, Uxbridge, as Scotland Yard applied for a court order to register the sex offenders under a court order.
Glitter previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for the possession of photographs of child rape.
According to the sources of the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, State Secretary for Interior rested and welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on stage because I want to show the artist on a personal side" artist Günther Bauer Photo artist.
No decorations, no hairs, no dancing shoes.
From the body of Grand Masters of flamenco, without the excitement of the action: to get to know the common face of dancers as well.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except at times of inner, distant from the audience, when we can get a personal move, grab the depth of a captured view, or we can cling to the beauty of an artist who is currently not performing a stage performance, but who is expressing the expression of his hand.
In the photo series of the German Günther Bauer Flamenco-pepole, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less known common side of the masters.
Through these photos, the specific iconography of flamenco is presented from different perspectives.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco's Photography Month, reflects the growing international significance of flamenco day-to-day, believes the creator, adding that Flamenco-pepole could be a character of anyone, since, in view of the pictures, the observer is amazed that these images do not typically represent artists.
These people on the street are artists who are able to take passion, sorrow, joy to the stage... and get the audience to take off.
However, stage photography is not suitable to capture their personality.
Their identity and character lie at the bottom of their beings.
I wanted to create an inside atmosphere that would allow me, with the help of the camera, to learn the personality of the fans of flamenco."
The Cante de las Minas festival gave a boost to Bauer in 1997, where portraits of flamenco singers, guitars and dancers were made with a record camera.
Thanks to the camera and the theme selection, classical photography is quoted.
However, the application of the various stylistic instruments breaks down with traditional image representation and conspires to modernisation. The following thought reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes from day to day and is always amazing."
It's not dancing, it's singing or music on its own, it's more like the artist's personality, the character of the artist spells the audience.
In the days, the Governing Body of the works that can be seen in the El Photographed Gallery is seeking to meet the essences of the art predicament, which can be seen through perception, existence and visualization.
The known shapes of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique More, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, and the names of Vice Amigo, describe this photograph collection of the subsequent 60 artists.
The project also became a flamenco-anthropology, which will soon be released by an album of the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits has been repeating the idea two years ago with the "SportART project" series "SportART project".
Although the concept of Flamenco-peple is somewhat different from that, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the hardest piece of photography is the portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you get people with personalities you sometimes don't even know, or people who only have a few minutes to take a photo shoot.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to reach out to my ideas.
The exhibition selected from the contemporary flamenco portraits, bearing the address Flamenco-pepole, will be held in El Photographa Galéria on 16 October.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel on which you work is a "premeditated strength".
The scene and the act are still unknown to the unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working to write a new novel about it. The main character of the novel is a Irish nationalist, Roger C Station, who has lived 20 years in Congo and Amazolia.
Last night at the Hay Festival Segovia event, a promising writer for the Bible Prize was admitted that his current work is "prepared for strength" and "all signs of not having to write" the novel.
"If I was smarter, I wouldn't, but I'd do it and hope I'd make a point at some point at some time", he closed his talk with these words at the festival of ideas, thoughts and reflections, which, four days in the town of Aqueduct, received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists, as well as thousands of visitors.
"The city and dogs" was the author of one of the most outstanding participants in the literary celebration, and he also entered the hope.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens's "Our Friend" novel. The performance filled Juan Bravo's theatre.
The audience was soon surprised by the hour in which the author of Peru explained with an amazing memory and a high amount of humor how he had developed his particular adventure of reading and his desire for life; how he would relive the spiritism with a well-established writing method, multiple documentation, many repairs and rewrites; how he felt his authoric call in Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what monuments it was built on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but added: "I don't think literature is a mere entertainment or an experience of words," because it forces them to influence people and think, so he asked the writers not to be tempted and to take responsibility for their commitment.
Due to the weather in the present weather, the party to Pozoblanco is shorter, and the horse-blavials of the Horses are also missing.
The horse bicadadad, which was traditionally held as the closing times of Pozoblanco's holidays, was deleted from the show before yesterday, after the future riding towers of the arena were found inappropriate for the oath.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to reject the bullavia.
Weather background events carefully destroyed the series of festivals, as two out of three events could not be held.
On Saturday, she stayed with the second bullavia because of the rain.
The future major players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz Curro and Juan Bautista Castilblancó, would have fought bulls from Castilblancó.
So they kept bikavia on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took three ears home as a trophies, and he was taken round to his shoulder after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle.
The same afternoon, through the two bulls of Alejandro Talavante, he obtained a number of recognitions and trophies, but this was due to the audience rather than its own performance.
After that, El Juli, who has contributed to the ageing of the reputation of the Los Llanos Arena.
With the second bull, after a comfortable ride, most of the audience managed to get the crowd out of the swamp.
In the face of a two tons of abdominal transport van tried to escape the road inspection by road.
Four hours 50 minutes in the morning.
In the field of administration of Armiñon (Álava), the Basque Regional Police are conducting traffic checks.
The authorities will stop a van in which two passengers are travelling, and passengers will try to escape the measure.
The shipment was more than two tons of hasis, but it was not noticeable.
The detectives pursued passengers, and one of them was arrested by a 28-year-old man and identified as A.A. J. - informed the Government of the Basque Government's Department of Home Affairs.
The caught man is accused of drug trafficking and document fraud.
The case was in the administrative field of Armiñon, where the staff of the Alava Forgalmi Supervisor had traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to do so, he suddenly gave me a gas, and then he left his inspection site.
The detectives took him into custody, then the vehicle moved a few miles away from the stopway, and his passengers fled from the motorway to a forest area from the highway.
The Task Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examination of the Iveco Daily brand van, he captured its shipment of 2178 kilograms of abdomen.
The police bodies have been transported to conduct a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug in the back of the vehicle.
In addition, the verification has shown that the false plate plate of the vehicle does not match the data contained in the van's papers, and therefore proceedings against the arrested are also brought against the person who has been arrested for the purposes of a public document forgery.
The Moscow Regional Police are conducting an investigation aimed at arresting another suspect, who, as mentioned earlier, fled the motorway and, on the one hand, defined the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant A. A. J. was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interviews, and then, within a few hours, the court proceedings started.
They arrested Heather Locklear as an actress because she was driving under the control of a medicine.
Sergeant Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend by the police in Santa Barbara (California) because it led under the influence of the medicine.
An eyewitness tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange mayonnaise - reported to the People magazine a spokesperson for traffic surveillance in California.
According to the witness, around 16 to 30 o'clock, Locklear pushed the gas to the pole, threw the engine in front and backwards, trying to leave the parking lot, and, in the back, he went over his sunglasses several times."
A little later, the witness, who was probably not aware of the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police because he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
"It seemed like a bad idea," so the patrols took him to a drug and alcohol investigation in a specialized centre.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperating and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded. The spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, they think that Locklear had been under the influence of the medicine.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under unidentified agents, transported to local prison around 19 o'clock, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the United Left Federation of the IU to deal with the Silva case.
Mr Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary-General of the United Left, has today declared that the regional Federation of the Development will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sports Council of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva.
"In these cases, I am a far-off federalist, and this is the matter that falls within the competence of the inalienable organization," Llamazare pointed out to the procedure that the party should apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, in order to identify any irregularities that may have been committed by Silva, " Transparency" should be borne in mind: "At IU has always been on the ground, in addition to making cases of this type of nature extremely transparent."
He added that part of the training was "the strict ethical code for civil servants."
"The blood of the brain", created by the epic of Garci.
He inspired José Luis Garci, who raised the famous French uprisings of the Spaniards in the blood of Mayus, which, with its budget of almost EUR 15 million, is the largest figure of the films of the Spanishs.
Accordingly, the director has attempted to illustrate, in his work as a well-known novelist, an admirable human flow and social analysis. Today, he spoke with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, the audience of actors.
More than two and a half hours of May blood is presented in cinemas on Fridays, and later it will be carried over four hours as a miniature by Telemad.
All this thanks to Esperanza Aguirra, who gave him three years ago from Madrid Province to prepare a monument for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on May 2nd. Garci accepted the invitation on condition that the basis of the story could be given to the National Epizoes.
The 15 million budget was fully financed by the Madrid Autonom Province, and it was a special opportunity for Garci to present the country with an old decoration and symbol of "the confused Spanishs who were wrongly involved with the bad leader," he said.
However, the director expressed his regret for not counting Mayus' blood on more than a double with the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms. Therefore, it was not necessary to miss a few scenes from the scenario, which - as for many other times - are recorded with Horacio Valcárcell.
So, the director of the reboot turned into his usual way of working with actors who started the tests before the shoot. Casting wasn't, because Garci thinks he's a "floater" and because, as he said, "the director's mastership is part of the theater and cinema, we're going to find out what's going on in the industry we're working on."
Several actors in the May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first step before his camera.
Garci, who can be proud of four Oscar marks and an Oscar prize, believes that before the Hollywood Academy of Academy of Sciences Spain candidates for this year, i.e. the blood of Mayus, the seven French pool tables and, finally, the blind sun-circulators, none of which represents the young generation of Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented," said, "where should it be presented".
Garci's film doesn't matter to any awards.
"You think you're working for the afterlife, and you realize that it's only a matter of happiness, and then you're happy when you're done with another movie," says Garci about 30 years of professional career behind her back.
Isabel Bayon recalls the life and art of the Egyptian dancer Tórtola Valencia's life and art.
A flamenco dancer in Seville also remembers me as a melody dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana district and moved to London with his parents at the age of three.
He was an expert in free dance and Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, whether Isdora Duncan, Virginia Wolof or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and fought to hold him in a way that inhibits women's freedom of movement.
His life impressed Isabel Bayon with the outbreak of a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe.
"I wanted to work with Pope Cambodia, and he suggested to me that Tórtola, whose personality is truly impressed."
The flamenco dancer said: "It is not our goal to tell the history of life, but to take hold of its spirit.
From the titles of his dances, I was reminded of flamenco styles.
For example, the tango of "scan dance" for guaji or "scan dancing".
"He danced well and others say that my style, too," he says.
Two extraordinary contributors highlight the light of the performance: Miguel Poveda, after the open door, now again sings at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, exceptionally wanted to work with a former disciple.
"Matilde transforms the older Tórto, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to your invitation, I'm very honored to be playing in my play."
In addition, music directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón are involved in the production of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga; El Paaaro is a hitman, Emperor Rafa El Viola, as well as actor Juanfra Juárez, who "is playing a constant character that is constantly falling apart with his true love."
The piece presents a large part of the life of the woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and then she goes to places that are still distant, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to give him a memory because his personality had a great impact on his age, but these days he's no longer known and he's even less respected his work", says Bayón.
The performance starts at 20 o'clock tonight at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "The Journal of a newly married poet" will appear.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the newly married poet's journal will be at Saint Stephen's Church (New York) where Juan Raménez married to Zeno in May 1916. The presentation is part of the series of programmes bearing the title of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organised by the Cultural Committee of the Andalás Regional Government on the 50th anniversary of the award of the Irish Nobel Prize and the anniversary of the death of the two.
Thus, Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are the re-issues of the work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize Poultry Memorial and the "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree" exhibition. The exhibition was open in May and is scheduled to visit New York for the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalus Regional Government has obtained eight hundred copies of the journal of the newly married poet's journal published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most multilateral donors.
Without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God sometimes brings perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from Sally Field actress, who worked in a film called the victims of the sensation of Newman and reflects the shock and inviolability that Newman's death caused in the American cinema and all of America.
Well, how hard it is for you to get the Oscar.
In 2007, he retired,
and he was known to be ill,
But even so, his death has slowed everyone down.
"Although it is impossible to express our feelings, and I have now lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "the existence of my life has made my life better and this country."
No one was afraid that it would be ridiculous or overreacted.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went through a particularly dark period covered by the desperate search of fear, American self-esteem and dignity due to terrorism and market conditions.
When these difficult times happen and many people easily lose their virtues and there are very few people we can look up to, then Luis Cernene doesn't have to be the one to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he has embellished the beauty and justice of the platian beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was a legal enemy and a defender of lost and won cases, from a drug-related anti-drug foundation created in memory of his firstborn's son who died of a drug overdose until his home-like bio-food brand was created.
It was a real gift to a country that was hard enough to overcome its suicidal nutritional culture.
The disgusting wonderwave has gone all over Hollywood without regard to nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says it wasn't a man, it was a time he died with him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar Prize winner Sam Mendes, has stated that his joint work with Newman clearly meant the summit of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia called Newman the biggest inspiration ever.
"He made the spirit very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who today are trying to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle: they require honesty and privacy away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of today's media jungle.
There's someone who's trying it, and Paul Newman's an example.
He once divorced, but then he lived in a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for 50 years, and certainly would have had many occasions for infidelity.
"Why should I eat burgers if the roast meat is waiting at home?" - he was joking.
In heaven, you may be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which in America is not too common.
"One of his plays was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the devoted human-friendly role", he says.
The best of the Madridi Olympics is a hot road.
Indeed, many dreams of a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 failed, it could be 2016.
But, I ask, are we really ready for this?
Because if we start last night's race, I don't think we will.
It was called a perfect race, but in my view, it was the worst of many of the things I've ever been to.
It was characterized by a blockage of infertility, and if you had to assess it once, and I would be the examiner, and the result would be clearly a failure.
But let's move forward and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the receipt of the number because it had to be done earlier.
However, this is not a problem, but once you go faster, you should at least receive everything at the same time (including chip, to avoid later employment).
That's not what happened.
First, the number was first handed over (first nonsense, only to go there early) and (after the usual job), which was surprising, only the T-shirt S (second nonsense because I had my XL size).
What kind of world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, do they decide to save money and buy cheaper, smaller-sized T-shirts?
Anyway, these things are still breaking up compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the horrific early time you had to go over the chip, the row took 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is understandable for a race race involving more than 11,000 people.
So, as it was expected, the race started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when we finally got there, it was worse.
In addition, the rain made it even more pleasant for more than 40 minutes to wait for, which was revised by experiments on populace and stand-up.
I think we're getting about 500 sure pneumonia tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, are not getting it at the real time.
If you asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn't think of it by any chance.
So I guess we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a Microsoft (virtual) receptioner.
At MIT's emerging Technology Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence which, however, can perform some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, for Microsoft, a vehicle in the area of the company) based on information from the discussion.
This "receptive" is a camera and a format and facial recognition system to help you realize how many people in the room, who - in fact, note what clothes they wear - and hears and understands the passwords of their conversation.
In addition, you can group people who are present on the basis of the discussions.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identified a third person, but she knows that she is not a member of the company that is talking to her and that she is not a employee of the company.
Ask him if he came to see someone and made sure that he was about to get his help.
This is without the blue big screen.
Very impressive.
But of course this is the music of the future.
At present, the company has a major role to play, such as the development of a new version of the Windows Operating System.
A lot of people this week realized that Microsoft's strategy was changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain less support programmes.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were to run all the commercial trash instead of running the necessary programs, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
Spanish wax has been invented, given that Microsoft has attached plus features and extras to Windows in all new versions so far.
The shift will be reversed.
Microsoft is right, the operating system needs more and more background and also the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google took the first step in making it a competition for Windows.
Many people have rightly acknowledged that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, as it is an essential element for the dialogue between hardware and software.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it will have to be calculated with the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but relatively.
Ballmer's announcement of this week's statement to support this idea.
People are increasingly paying less attention to the operating system and increasingly to the web browser.
The computer will only be activated to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and it will be more and more time for browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What is the majority of applications associated with the system?
Less sometimes more.
And Windows 7 less, you have to be much less than Visa.
Less difficult, less depressed, less complicated.
The aim of Microsoft is to better integrate on-line services and eventually to make it an alternative to Google.
They all need to know, I will already give you an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in a partnership for Microsoft developers in Redmond.
A poster of soda machine calls them to use the company's browser. "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent investigation found that 66% of Microsoft professionals used Google for online browsing.
In addition, last week a new version of Windows Mobile 7 has also been announced.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of the year, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 into the market.
After all, the mobile phone would be more and more functional as a computer.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel le Fabuleux Marcelel
This was taken by Pablo Picasso in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Blood diamond, Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Crosspath, and this is also one of the basic clothes of the sophisticated gay customer community.
And even if we're already on the list of specialities, we can recall the peace figure of the chauvinist of the migratory circus.
What are we talking about?
I mean, "tank", as they call it "el", but none of their competitors can compete with Fabulux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of its elegant name - although it is mentioned only as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to sport, according to legend, he was named after a boxer named Marcel Cerdan, a singer of Edith Piaf's singer.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, uniqueization, special emblem, and also his own competition because of the small (under-identified) inner flag, the latter are carried by the most important models around the surface of the shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sporters, retro boxers, cassette-kardigans, wool pants, sailors, dolls, minisors, and more can be listed - all-all of the company's products are included in the company's products.
And they're all included in the category of comfortable underpants,
Although it is regrettable that they should be worn as underwear.
Too good for that.
"I would love to be a young mom, no matter who the father is."
He was very similar to his brother, but he managed to reach out to himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
At present, Cruz Sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means much more than some pretty and beautiful girls give their name to something.
There has been a contribution to the promotion of the new headquarters of Mango in Paris, as well as the transfer of the most ambitious fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's a warm and gentle flood.
In fact, what are you doing in Paris?
Mango's new autumn and winter collection is presented as planned by my brother Penélop, and we are also participating in the second invitation to the Mango Fashion Awards, and in honor of Valentino in Opera.
It's a rather dense day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango, where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love movies from the '50s and '60s; from there we have taken a lot of fun.
And then, a lot of times, I just walk into town and watch the women dress up, how they turn and sort their clothes together - it's one of my favorite times.
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, but finally these three things are connected, because they have a lot of common points in them.
Even when I was little, I was looking forward to going to my grandmother's place and going to my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you in Canaan, almost got up with a theme park.
And then as a dancer, I've always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for lessons and trials, so we can have fun looking into the mirror.
And in the role of the actress, you're really gonna be the same as your role when you get the costume.
See, everything is connected, and I have all due respect for designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever loved the '30s.
I think women are really worth it, and they've already experienced enough, and they've made less mistakes in life.
And the biological hour doesn't concern me.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I feel like, and it's having a big internal happiness.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I'd like to be a young mom, and I don't want to miss that.
As far as the future father is concerned, no matter who it is.
To raise my child in joy and great-great love.
Let's have a word about the movie, and you've been filming several films last year that haven't even been introduced.
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to coming out.
I, who started at the theater, am very impatient and anxious, want everything straight away, but of course I know that's impossible.
I look forward to showing you the last hour and the search for Christ's grave.
I wonder how you feel about them...
I understand you've been flattered on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true...
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which he arranged for his own organization called Women for a better world. I have chosen two of my own Mango collections.
People don't even know how kind-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much about him, so I know him, and I can make sure half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look at the right side of his activity.
He asked me to do the fashion show for no reason, but if he wanted me to stand on his head, I'd do the same.
If the fate of women living in a third world is a bet, I don't know it's impossible.
Fall drunk leaders will be obliged to install Alcolock.
The Ministry of Justice, after three drunk driving infringements, would require the installation of a device to prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver is in or does not enter into the structure.
The proposal was submitted in June and is now being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which the pilot project will take a year.
Since the project is intended to be restored to circulation, the car driver will also have to participate in a repeated course of transport education.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Transport, this experiment will also be carried out by the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute for Safety and Technology (FITSA).
According to statistics, 30-75% of cars arrested several times as a result of drunk driving are back into cars.
This would prevent Alcolock, as the system connected with the vehicle establishes the alcohol level of the inhaled air. If it is greater than permitted, or if the driver has not turned the vehicle into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of the instrument with more than 1000 euros would be a burden on the controller.
A 2007 U.S. study has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments may reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives per year could be saved by this rule.
For two reasons, the measure focuses on infringements: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming criminal,
Whereas the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the ordinary field, the necessary criminal reform would require a fundamental change of law.
The instrument on the Spanish market is not yet available in any form of trade, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The Assembly will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which - for the example of France - calls for the system to be included in school buses.
In Mexico, in closed shoes in closed shoes in Mexico.
At the time of the programme, 17:00 p.m., in the hangar of the President of the Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City, the Spanish Air Force was landed at 40 minutes.
The sun was already down, but it was so hot that we could only see our hand as an eyeballer using our hands as an eyeballer for the royal party coming out of the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other prominent personalities stood.
I asked a cab driver on the street a few hours before he knew if the Spanish Prince Party would be coming to the city for an official visit.
Okay, well, then I won't be able to make any airport transfers for a long time today... the woman's come up here or something like that...
No, no, sir, the lady Spanish, she was just living here for a few years.
- Yeah, or maybe...
But the Mexican press, and that then knows everything about the Asturias Prince Party and the importance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting for the airport hangar to be a red carpeted carpet by the regime created by the 27 Marine soldiers, who provide protection for dignity.
He shows up in the Prince, smiling, blue dress, and then the Princess gets caught in her long hair in the wind, in her restrained dress, but not in the usual shoes with toes - may have been warned that Mexico City is threatened by a storm.
They stop for a second and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception takes place.
At the gate of their hotel, one of the four largest hotels in the city, is waiting for them as one of the reporters of Mexican television.
The most valuable fashion fee is the most valuable fashion price price.
The world's best place to hand over a fashion prize is undoubtedly Paris, and among today's fashion designers, the most sophisticated and brilliant of all, Valentino.
Mango has recently announced the second proposal for the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to internationalize young talent from the fashion industry.
The main prize is EUR 30 000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first invitation to tender, saw his own design clothes in the Mango window below the Paris Boulevard Haussmann 54, and it nearly eased his strength.
By the way, this is the second largest European business of the company and it has just been opened 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is located in London.
In the midst of the events of the scales and the statements of thanks to Valentino for the sitting of the jury, we finally found ourselves in the Garnier Opera in Paris.
The president's table, prepared by Mango, was even more visible in the company of the most popular Chagalok.
Nati, whose brother, who had recently died, had come with a hard heart and sorrow, was wearing one of the Company's pieces and some of the breathtaking jewelry of the ELAH.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, was interested in the guests. At the bar of Rotchil, they were so knightish that they eventually stayed without a suit because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz arrived at the store in his own designed pants and shirts, and at dinner he wore a sexy long, long, black dress. At the night's opera visit, Gaya Toledo joined the ballet room with the old-fashioned idea that he was doing a whole grand pli-style thing.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before him, he showed me some photos of his son's cell phone.
The following morning, we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he will also be two metres tall and motors - and John Travolta has arrived at the Intercontinental in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he was good in advance telling us that he wouldn't want any smell in the room.
Stars under the Paris Star Spirit.
Oh là, c'est la vita.

The good news is that we can all find it in a single book that arrives at the bookstore on 30 September to bring peace with you.
It's almost embarrassing the hour spin at 7:00 in the morning, but it's worse to think about how fast it's forced to life every day to the day of the world.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer's back pain.
The stress is the people's disease of the 21st century.
However, there is not one or two ways to deal with daily fatigue and overcome job problems.
No, this number is exactly 1001 is equal to.

If you've been too low to refresh your adrenaline body and become a central problem in your stress life, it's time to stay in the chair, relax, and focus only on reading.
They talk in their dreams.
Some kids talk at night.
I don't think of people who get upset and completely forget what happened to them that day, but those who talk during sleep.
At first, the phenomenon may seem scary, but it is actually completely harmless.
It's called a good sleep disorder called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they told more of you that you talked last night.
In terms of its frequency, it can be completely practising (e.g. once in a high fever disease), or more frequent (days, weeklys or once a month) and the child usually doesn't remember anything the next day.
Displaying cannot be reversed for one trigger reason.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night anxiety, night bed contact (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but it is not lawful either.
As has been mentioned, high fever-related conditions, or even stress or heightened excitement, can be accompanied by an accompanying state.
In any event, they have studied little so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, it may be incomprehensive words, immorality, but unlike these, it may also appear in the form of screaming, crying or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and the specialist. The investigation may reveal that there is no problem of major anxiety in the background and can provide solutions.
As mentioned above, there is no cure for this phenomenon unless it comes with another form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, there are some things we can do, and here is a pretext measure:
Let's make sure that the child stays calm before bed.
Let us select relaxing games and avoid the child from watching fear-absorbing or aggressive TV shows or series.
For children who are prone to nervousness or who are more anxious, we can teach some relaxing methods to find inner rest easier.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
If he starts to talk while he's sleeping, let's try to keep the rest of his breath.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful advice.
Don't wake the child up.
It would be superfluous because the child is unconscious, but he'd get out of sleep.
Even though you're talking, you're actually still asleep and resting.
Remember, if you have several severe anxietys, contact a professional or discover what causes a child to become a major anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), do not start asking questions to find out anything from him.
It wouldn't be unnecessary, since when you were sleeping, it's not so conscious that you'd get your thoughts together.
On the other hand, you just hear the talk, but you do not see the dream images that are associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation and possible conclusions of the hearing.
Never tell the child that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
It's making me nervous.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Finally straight to Illhaeusern Illhaeusern
After a long low flight, Illhaeusern's team has finally taken a new boost, and he's won again on his way home.
Although there wasn't a ferge game, the yellow-blacks were in a number of situations, from which they could eventually win one of them.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as it was difficult for the attackers to feel the right rhythm.
The first gate was shot by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball was just touched by the upper corner of the gate tree. Then Illhaeussern was captured, and they followed each other with the shots: Fanderflick tried to shoot a long shot, and then Hirn shot up the gate.
On the other side, players in a block were defending themselves in the middle field, and only the eternal Riahi Riahi was in a shooting position.
The beginning of the second half was a crucial promise: Riah and Temporae were first in position on the side of Dannemarie. Right after that, the first goal was born: After the first shooting of Diebold, he obtained the ball with an excellent position for Ilehaserni Marais and then sent it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern's goalmaker could not have enjoyed the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so his team members had to continue their fight in human terms.
The Dannemarie, however, was unable to benefit from the advantage: no problems were caused by the domestic team, who just pulled back a little bit further to confirm their protection. Only the last seconds kept some excitement when the ball got very close to the hood after the big arrival.
Sarkozy will meet the angry fishermen with the angry fishermen.
Before flying to the United States, Sarkozy will make an exit to Brettany.
On Monday, the demonstration by fishermen has paralysed the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the Le Guilvinec port of Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protestors.
The latter promised that the President would be welcomed in a constructive spirit and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with specific proposals.
The visit by the President coincides with the meeting of the Committee on the Environment, created by breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the rise in the price of oil, as the oil price exceeded the average average price of EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to President Martinon, the President of the Republic, "the President will discuss with fishermen what solutions could help companies to regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers".
Fishermen are determined to await the arrival of Sarkozy Nicolas.
In the morning of Tuesday, traffic demonstrations were conducted in Morbihan and Calvados County, with which nearly 10 km were subjected to long distortions.
They also paralyzed the transport of Quiberon's yacht, but the roads leading to Belle-ïle have not been blocked.
On the Cyberon Peninsula, roadblocks were placed on the highways.
On Monday, the sailors have already demonstrated their determination, then at dawn, tyres and pallets were set up in front of the fuel warehouses of the Brest ports, while protests were also held in Concerteau and Saint-Brieec.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic coast and La Manche. In Vendée County Sables d'Olonne, for example, fishermen were not boarded, while around 20 vessels in Le Havre hindered the traffic of commercial vessels.
In the evening La Turbale and Le Croisic's fishermen in the Loire-Atlantique region were removed from the massive Total refinery block in Donges.
On the other hand, Boulogne-sur-Mer's fishermen decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the Ministry by deciding on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the Committee must decide on the next step and take part in the meeting scheduled for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some devotees do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Committee since they did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues", because "the fishermen do not allow their demands" and "I refuse to travel to Paris", for example, declared Liliane Cariou, president of the Loiient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the operation of a vessel would only be profitable if the price of gas oil decreased by EUR 0,30 per litre.
A wonderful Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is an unforgettable headliner at the home of Connecticut, 83 years old, due to death, cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also given up their respect for the cinemalist who died when he was 83 years old and committed to his profession, Paul Newman.
Embraer will not change its 2008 transport plans.
Despite the crisis affecting the world economy, Brazil plans to land 215 aircrafts this year.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Embraer, is able to keep the plans, and in 2008 he plans to deliver 215 aircraft - confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, the company president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian producer is a large part of the Chinese market, in particular for 30-120 aeroplanes.
Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers over the past eight years.
AIG would sell over 15% of its assets more than 15% of AIG's assets would sell more than 15% of AIG's assets.
The American International Group's insurance company, which has been built up by the US financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay its previous $85 billion - reported the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international life insurance and pension insurance activities, AIG would be excluded from almost all other business parts of AIG - the paper clarified which quoted resources close to the case.
The Times reports that AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday night to examine the possibility of selling.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets intended to sell AIG include an aircraft leasing company called International League Financial Corp., a 59% share of the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments - add Times.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales yet.
AIG will have to get liquid assets quickly to repay a loan of USD 85 billion to the US Government, which will take the risk that it will have to take up from 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders by the same proportion.
Paris History study on Morning Meeting's historical Morning Meeting meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historical decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's rescue plan. The Dow Jones index fell back by 6.98% (which has never seen a decrease of nearly 800 points) and Nasdaq by 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Age Index (DJIA) fell by 77,68 points, thus closing at 10 365,45 points.
The largest fall in the index was registered on 17 September 2001 when the trade started again after the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001.
The Nasdaq 199,61 exact writeback was closed at 1 98,73 points, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index decreased to 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1 106,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weakened at the opening, and then when the Senate suddenly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore the market balance, it started flying down.
Members rejected the funds requested by Henry Paulson Minister for Finance by 228 'no' votes to 205 'yes'.
The plan by the Republicans has been adopted by nearly two thirds of the Republicans.
"That's why the market has caused bad signals, as it seems that Congress is unable to approve a plan" - says Lindsey Piegza, the FTN Financial Analyst of FTN.
"It also shows how much the market has calculated this plan", he added, and then expressed his concern about the fact that if a few days later they would accept such a plan, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is really condemned to death (...), then it will be Fed (American central bank - the machines.) and other central banks to deal with the crisis, and the lending conditions will be tightened further" - warns Brian Bethune, the economist of Global Insight.
To further improve the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "All the days before before are another financial institution going bankrupt" in the United States.
After a Friday bankruptcy in Washington Mutual, the authorities have made sure that Wachovia's banking business is purchased by its rival, the Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which has made urgent measures necessary to save banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market is "not only an American, but a global crisis", adds the FTN Financial analyst to the FTN.
The bond market has been significantly improved.
The 10-year government bond was reduced from 3.827% to 3.632% on Friday evening, and it dropped from 4.357% on the previous day from 4.161% to 4.161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television pair.
On Friday, the first debate of the two U.S. presidents followed a new one, which had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the pair.
Not surprisingly, the leaders of the Republican and the Democratic campaign both called themselves the victory in the television party, which was monitored by one third of US households.
According to the political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's actions were respectable, it did not prove to be sufficiently "congratifying" to stop the decline in its popularity: it is demonstrated by surveys carried out five weeks before the presidential election.
According to Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate is better in the fight: according to the results published on Saturday's poll, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49%).
According to 39% of those surveyed among the most prominent, even unsolved candidates, Obama will win, while 25% of them will be worth McCain winning, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase the advantage of his partner, Joseph Biden, with a promising Thursday performance. He is preparing for his first and only public debate with Sarah Palin, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be a shame to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts."
McCain, who has been in his 70s, will never forget to put forward his own undisputed enormous foreign policy experience. However, he stresses his opponent 'navicty' on these issues that were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"It seems that Senator Obama doesn't understand that..."
"I don't think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge for the president's position", declared McCain.
This is the main attack surface, which is also used by Republican television ads since yesterday.
In contrast, Obama stressed that he represents the future.
He did not allow himself to be disturbed: he prepared and made a very specific statement.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the picture of the United States of America in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama already did"," said the democrat ad sent back this weekend, which, to the attention of the Republican leader, says that he still has not assessed the impact of the crisis on the American "utca people".
"In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", said Obama in front of twenty thousand people who gathered in North Carolina at the election meeting.
The confused situation in the financial world is undoubtedly in favour of Obama, which Americans consider most suitable to save the economy that is at the edge of the collapse.
"The next week could prove to be a turnpoint" - he believed that yesterday, Senator Charles Schumer, the powerful democratic senator.
According to one of the veterans of the Clinton Government, Rahm Emanuel's democratic representative, Obama's 'an economy' has excellent instincts like Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In view of the democratic Presidency, the current crisis is the "final judgment on the bad economic policy for eight years, created by George Bush, with the support of Senator McCain".
The ilinos Senator has reaffirmed that despite the fluctuations in its stock exchanges, he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that its primary objectives include the establishment of the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
However, McCain plans to set up 45 nuclear power plants until 2030.
However, both presidents carefully excluded the issues relating to the bank rescue plan of EUR 700 billion (470 billion): the very unpopular plan was adopted by the Congress last night.
Minsk: "I've noticed that there's been a choice here?"
Young people and opponents made a statement on Sunday night at the capital of Belarus to reject the expected outcome of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closure of the polling posts, hundreds of Belarus gathered together in the main square of Minsk to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not yet been published, a number of young protests against President Alexandra Lukashenko were against the following words: "Dictator, give up!"
Some people admit that they didn't even go to vote, "Why would I go?" They're doing my vote with what they want!" says a young man.
The protestors do not believe that the regime, which, in front of foreign observers, sought to indicate itself in a good way to the European Union, would be ready for a democratic change of system.
If the elections were to be made clear by observers, they would be able to resolve the country's sanctions which have been refused the visa from 40 Belarus leaders and some bank accounts have been frozen.
However, the opposition claims that the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were held by election committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the voting count" - sorry Jurij Potyemkin, organized from the twelve parties, so he is a very heterogeneous spokesperson of the United Democratic Force coalition.
"The changes were only nominal" - stresses Aleksandr Milinkievics, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The main point is to put out votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition get into Parliament, it means that they have been appointed and not elected.
However, their access to Parliament allows them to be placed on television, to be able to meet in regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore act in political life, because 'a dialogue with the European Union must be launched'.
Because if our heavily-responsive economy against Russia is facing a crisis and we are unable to renew it, we risk being under Russia's jurisdiction.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the outcome of the vote will be accepted as valid by the European Security and Cooperation Organisation following the election process.
It is stressed that the participation rate seems to be too high and that the broad organisation of the pre-accession vote (26% of the voters participated in Minsk) has allowed any manipulations to take place.
"You have noticed that there has been a election here?" said Alekszandr Kozulin, leader of the Socialist Democratic Party, who was last released from prison this August of the second, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one in the polls has been absent.
In Parliament, there will be no more than five opposition representatives, namely those who are best suited to the leadership.
In October space again, the night's quiet is quiet.
On television, the president of Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Committee will succeed.
Again safe blood blood is safe in your blood blood.
President Francine Décary had a good reason for celebrating, because today the Hema-Quebec became one of the safest and most efficient blood tax companies in the world.
The most important thing is that he has managed to regain people's trust, which has seriously stifled the effect of the scandal on infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the national blood storage of Red Cross is infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
In February 1994, following the drama and the general decline, the Government of Canada launched an official investigation under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever, which was designed to explain the circumstances that led to tragedy and to propose to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever has submitted his late report, a number of provinces have set up their own committee to plan a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
As a result of the Gélineeau and Krever reports, two blood services were established in Canada: one was the Héma-Quebec serving Quebec, and the other was the Canadian Blood Protection Company responsible for all the other provinces and the two territory services.
"When he started his activities in 1998, only 38% of people have had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system" - remembers Dr. Décary back.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and as a result of our work in the field, we managed to regain people's confidence." Décary states proudly that in early 2008, almost 94% of the population in Quebec thought that he had been trusted by the Hema-Quabebetce.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is extremely fragile".
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has applied the precautionary principle.
A number of cases have been discovered in Europe during this period when a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has affected people - the doctor who has been managing the company since the start of 1998.
"We had no idea whether this disease spreads through blood.
We therefore rely on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports. This means that if we are uncertain about this, and if there is a risk of serious disease, then we must apply the exclusion measures. In this case, it was Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes brain changes, leading to inevitable death.
Therefore in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And for a few years, there has been no doubt that the disease also spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows the HIV virus to be much more sensitive to diagnose. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which is directly capable of detecting the virus in the blood of blood donors, not against the virus, on which the tests used were based.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the window battery that keeps the virus from being infected until we can show it in the blood using our technical devices - explains the professional.
This period could be reduced to more than one week for a shorter period.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk that blood donors could infect the blood and that it could not be demonstrated.
These developments greatly reduced the risk of transmission of AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, there is a risk that someone who is given blood that is infected with HIV virus is worth 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should divide 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes 400 to 500 thousand blood products each year, it should take more than 24 years for one such case to happen and one of them should be infected with HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that anyone can accept or write up blood transfusions to restore health - says Hema-Quebec's number one leader.
"The challenge of the coming decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen goes into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikununya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insecticide.
That is why we have to be constantly alert" - Dr. Décary continued, and then stressed that, apart from emergency storage, the Hema-Quebec would have to provide sufficient permanent reserve.
"As the population ages, demands increase as well.
Since anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the population of blood taxes, as the number of people on the network is only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person who is at least 18 years old and who fulfils the conditions of competence can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria was destroyed for a year are not eligible for blood transfusions.
"So we have three percent of the reserves that we can meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of platelets to the extent that the existing ones are old because they can't give blood after a while.
But it is very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it is even harder for them to keep them and make them regular blood transfusions.
In today's rushing world, one hour of man's life is barely enough to go and give blood" - French Décary is sorry.
Hema-Quebec, an annual budget of 297 million, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin tissue, which are used for persons who are almost only severely burned.
These tissues are analyzed, converted and frozen, then placed at the Hema-Quebec, which also treats the only public stem cell bank in Quebec.
Only a blood obtained from stem cells treated as medical waste can help treat severe diseases (such as leukemia) in the stem cells.
"We spent several weeks celebrating the fact that we've been in our bank for a thousand years, and we plan to take out more than a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of the next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants" - Dr. Décary, who says that today is a very popular programme for the collection of children.
"A lot of Mom's sad because there's no way of doing this" - that's true, because the Hema-Quebec has no way of making this complex and costly program available in every hospital in Quebec.
Fun - in the end, the Impact is the presiding Impact.
The Montreal Impact team won Seattle Sounders by 3:1 yesterday on USL-1 screen, and the combined 4:3 result entered the pre-final. It was the second quarter final and the final match to which the Saputo stadium took place.
The final goal was Antonio Ribeiro mid-term scored the match in 90th minute.
While it was the first half-time goal, in the second, the two midways of the montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, were found in the enemy's net.
Roger Levesque, alone of the Sounders team, managed to play the Matt Jordan Gate.
Remember that at the first match on Friday, Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Stockholm, Seattle suburbs.
Impact plays the pre-final with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday night, in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which received 3:1 in the first game from Whitecaps, won 4:3, but in the pre-final, Whitecaps came in with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are specified on today's day.
Dióháj - Kovalev is a victory holoe.
The Canadians' favorite performer is waiting for the new season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the three great attacks, and finally the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers by 3:2 per cent of the criminal penalties last night in the Centre Bell.
Kostsyn, the first star of the meeting, won a goal. Plekanec two, Kovalev closed the match with one goal pass, which was the fourth victory from the six preparations of the team.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not prepared" - warns the Russian player.
"You have to have another game to make me feel really good."
"He's been trying too hard to get himself out of his first third grade", noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think the end of the game was happy.
He's got a huge exit."
North of Charest's efforts are due to the efforts made by Charest north of its North-nor herds.
The Prime Prime Minister will not rule out that the election will start this year's election will start this year.
The meeting of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest yesterday, has already traveled to Jean-Talon Quuébeci, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) will be the winner of the interim election to be held today.
"Repress our last large northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was developed by Jean Charest at the meeting of the Québec Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to concentrate on the substance.
During the performance, behind his back, he drew sets like Moulin à images.
The three huge impressive images followed each other: dams of water plants, mining, Québec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister, however, refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this fall, although he added that his schedule was very close.
The fourth pillar is the vision of the Prime Minister Quebec's future, which is being tested in a new economic area. It includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of agreements with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. north of the 49th century) has often been in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never held a presentation on this subject.
However, the Head of State merely explained why he considered the North to be a treasure mine with huge potential. However, he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts, or the specific priorities for future projects.
Only a few development options have been raised: above all, water plants, forestry and especially mining, which will further stimulate the growth of nearby countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north, "Wild, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamond" - listed Charest.
This area, which is "two times the size of France", is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
Not just us, but within us", the Head of State reiterated his desire to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold wave in Abibibi, the Québec design work, the James Bay...
"This is our future!" - he added, after holding a stage break, he remembered the giant map behind his back.
The North, moving 70% of Quebec, also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested - the Prime Minister announced at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a limit on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an occasion for it, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government", he stated.
On the other hand, "In the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our view of the North", the Prime Minister said about the northern passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
According to the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, the withdrawal of the area is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, Indians and eskimos?
The Prime Minister has stated that the government of Quebec will pay particular attention to them and that the plan will bring much benefits, especially for young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (laterly sent to the Hungarian Party Québécois) have already begun the conciliation with around thirty local communities.
Benoît Pelletier also launched an inter-ministerial committee in which Julie Boulett ( Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) played an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they create a common vision.
In line with the principles of sustainable development, the development of sustainable development would take place in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly" - promised the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this vision as being in line with the ideas of the former liberal prime ministers.
"Just like previous liberals, we think differently: we aim to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the returning topics for the weekend that started on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate Jean Lesage's 50th anniversary.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois plant be baptized by the Adélard-Godmis damta.
"The politicians of our country, including the founder of Hydro-Quabece, God about God, the quiet revolution and the national decoupling of water plants, or the Bouras, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to build the future," said Jean Charest.
He also quoted another piece of work - true and conservative - at the press conference, including John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 and 1963, "Roads to the North".
As regards the plan for the barrier to the Eastmain1a-Ruper plant, President Charest pointed out that the deployment was planned for 2012.
"This is between us, but I'm planning to be there," she told her names and accepted her statement with a loud tapsvihar.
For the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote this fall, which the law will allow him to vote for.
He pointed out, however, that his calendar was already full, since he was in charge of the Federal Council meeting in China and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
The meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the presentation of nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without thought. Here, in particular, it calls for recognition by the Liberal Party of the specific nature of Québec in the Constitution.
I would also like to have Quebec appoint members of the Canadian radio and telecommunications councils, and these members would have the right to veto about the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the other hand, the opposition has sceptically adopted the main points of the North Plan.
Paulina Marois, leader of the Parti Québécois, re-introduced the North Québecic Development Policy, which was implemented by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in 2003 rejected the application of this policy.
If they hadn't done it, 'we'd like to hold it a little sooner', Mrs Marois said in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was the candidate for today's vote in Jean-Talon.
The opposition party AQ supports the government's acceptance of the North Plan.
"But we want this not to be a mere play of color", noted Sébastien Proulx, a party leader who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Letters - A Deeded Country
Mr. Torews, Minister of Harper-Kabinet, and also Minister of Justice, took the courage last summer to call Louise Arbourt Canada "the shame".
Thus, to shame a woman who fought forever for justice and deserves all her wonders - that tells a great deal about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government that, in one of the Western countries concerned, has not delivered home its own nationals from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This government, which absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes brought to him.
This is the only government that, although Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, has refused its word and will allow a child soldier to march under inhuman circumstances.
The only government that's doing a puppet theater in justice is investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us bear in mind that the Association of UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian Lawyers also demands the return of Omar Khadr to be given a fair trial in Canada.
And our government has an eye on the cake: it does not matter to him that a young adult is now completely destroyed and that many years of torture may have saved her fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently losing our rights, our freedom and our democracy. "Democracy": Harper calls this word that sounds like an empty voice from his mouth.
The time has come when no longer exists morals: selfishly beaten, tortured and imprisoned any Canadian citizen according to the willingness of a government leader who has been in a minority until now (and what can be done after 14 October...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that honors the Spirit, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is cutting down the values that our country has had for its good reputation and dignity.
Dear Mr. Toews, the shame is not to look elsewhere.
Opinion on the Barrick Gold orwell vocabulary for Orwell.
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of Barrick Gold mine in Canada, was published in Le Devoir's September 17th issue.
Following Orwell's development, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched a $6 million defamation trial against three authors and a small-money company in order to initiate a so-called 'public debate'.
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in the criminal court, is not made by justice, but by law.
It's not surprising Garver was deeply listening to this basic difference.
Would it really be the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to destroy anyone who disagrees with his position?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant sums on defence and fighting in an uneven fight, where on the other side, lawyers who have supported almost impeccable sources of resources from the mining industry are armed with a military force.
In the face of such an uneven fight, however, it is often used to use the tactics of destroying the alperist and friendly agreement, which not only silences the opposites, but also tosss those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, then he should have made his views known before public opinion.
Although in many other countries, where Barrick Gold is active, this is another way, the debate parties in Canada are usually not hitting each other with a stick, they say their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough to open its books and papers and prepare for a real debate in the press, media, publications, paying for independent research groups that could have revealed light on the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public, and with a move, it is misleading the applications and letters written in defence of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could initiate a 'public debate' if he at the same time disagreed with this public opinion?
In the head of the Vice-President, this word is probably just about the lawyers paid by the bus rather than the total residence of Canada: the meaning of the concept is well removed.
In a democratic state, freedom of speech is acceptable even to others.
On the other hand, Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada mainly support the public because he condemns the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and make a judgment, but on the basis of civilised arguments, rather than by a trial for silence for many. (In the context of the term 'public debate', Barrick Gold recently called in writing the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to the surreal developments of Garver, the Barrick Gold process is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic society.
In general, it reserves the right to quote from authentic sources, to discuss facts and interpretations which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If in a country like Canada only you can study and discuss topics that do not like rich companies in today’s world, who will take courage for it?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, this could be done according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer that question.
In our university circle, we have been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts for a long time now.
In contrast to his statement, Barrick Gold has shown that it has no interest to continue an open debate.
This represents a loss for both the world of universities and the institutions of public debates in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place measures that restrict legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street rescue - The Democrats and Republicans agreed.
Yesterday, the leaders of the Bush Government and the Republic of Congress Republic and the Democrats reached an agreement on the economic rescue action, which has since the great global economic crisis in the 1930s has been the biggest-state plan of this kind since the 1930s.
The $700 billion worth of a plan aimed at halting the financial crisis that has been taking place in Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by two Houses of Congress.
The key points of the plan are the effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms for the repayment of foreseen public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses occupied due to the absence of payments; the right of input to pay the managers of aided companies.
Mr. Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Parliamentary House and Mr. Judd Gregg, President of the Republican Republic yesterday, the good news was announced a few minutes before midnight after the two-day Maraton trial ended.
"We have made progress towards a solution that will function effectively on the markets" said Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush Government.
"We have done everything we can to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic representative.
"The key aspect is that if we don't do this, we'll have a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of Americans", said Judd Gregg, a Republican representative of the Republic of Judd.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours in fear that another failure would have an adverse effect on investors' mood.
The stock exchange agreement was given a deadline until the opening of the stock exchange this morning.
The two presidencies who joined the negotiations later showed themselves to be willing to reach agreement, but it was expressed, however, that they are not pleased that the situation has increased to the end.
Senator Barack Obama himself owned the extension of the agreement with elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of the house or the payment of the payment of the heads of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps on the irresponsibleness of other people, it is not a very enjoyable thing to do.
These steps, however, are necessary", noted on an American television show.
And when he was opposed, John McCain was asked if he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, he said: "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I have read in large lines is already apparent that it is something that we all have to digest and that we can move forward.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would buy the double claims of US financial institutions, some kind of unsalesable assets that they put at risk.
The plan has been preceded by a 14-month crisis that led to the de-recognition of real estate loans. This led first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (second mortgage loans) and then to the spread of other debt instruments (traded) and finally to the freezing of liquid assets and the collapse of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican representatives failed the first draft agreement last week.
It seems that we've been able to get rid of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to ensure that some of the "toxic" instruments of companies in difficulty are only guaranteed by the government rather than purchased by them.
In order to ensure that all members of the Congress are satisfied, a provision has also been included in the plan, which provides that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, it would initially be paid up to a amount of USD 250 billion; this could be followed by another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The payment of the remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress by a new vote.
In exchange for the assistance, Washington will acquire a share in the supported companies by which it will receive dividends from profits and which it can sell after the crisis is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the reservation of the mortgage-backed properties covered by the plan. It will also adjust the maximum value of wages and commissions to managers of companies affected by the crisis.
I would like the members of the plan to vote on the plan today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their strengths, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Because the statements against the plan were repeated yesterday by both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is very clear that Washington does not hear your voice" - declared that Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the financial committee of the house, was elected to his constituents.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would benefit taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a democratic representative of a small convention group that is known as the "sceptical faction", presents things differently, but the same conclusion is reached.
"Six hundred excellent business experts, including three Nobel Prizes scientists, have written us to ask Congress: do not hurry and look carefully at which path he will choose", said Sherman yesterday.
In Europe at the same time, it was once again understood that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis, the three Benelux states have announced that EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars) is state-owned part of the Fortis Group.
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French Government announced that BNP Paribas did not buy a competitor on the edge of the bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 million (U.S.I. 20.9 billion) due to the crisis in secondary US mortgage loans.
With Fortis 85,000 employees, twenty largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies are among the largest insurance companies.
"This is no money" - said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"We get voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British Government seems to be preparing to state a new bank that has been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over the entire ongoing loans of the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which the real estate loans amount to 41 billion (U.S.$75.5 billion).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they were going to purchase the subsidiaries and clients of the British Bank.
The Bradford and Bringley after this Northern Rock would be the second bank that the British Government has wanted to state since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Good luck with the acting server.
In some cases, the eye of the beautiful beads thought it was the greatest weakness in the world, while others felt that it was the greatest weakness.
Is it ever rid of the Marcian mirror of the yellow smile American actor?
Yeah, and I'm not.
Through its shyness, sensitivity, and inherent talent, he was also away from the brush style that is the essence of the true great monuments of the artist world.
But what a great career he's run into.
Paul Newman died at the age of 83, in lung cancer, on Friday he was the owner of Connecticut, one of the last icons of the flower age of American cinema.
There was a less monumental personality than Brando, who was like him, and who was considered to be a member of the film company for a long time. He was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his methods, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
Blood blending often results from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic figure of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, which just increased his merits.
In the early 1950s, he became a country of interest to the ideal of a "self-made man" and to the idea of a broken warrior in the Pacific War. In the early 1950s he studied at the Yale University drama and then at the Actor's Studio of New York before the theatre, television and not much later into the world of cinema.
In addition to being a live warrior of civil rights, in 1979, he was second in my 24-hour race in Le Mans, and he was considered a sex symbol, although since 1958 he had been married to Joanne Woodward, an actress who had been a happy woman.
Now we can never find out what the shadows of this mysterious, closed-minded actor's life has been called to his work, who hated his show-busing.
He was an honest man, in the most normal sense of all.
The death of Paul Newman at the end of the week was shocking the cinemas: in his great roles we can see only on the black screen of memories.
Throughout our lifetime, the seventh American art, the cinema has been adjusting for over 50 years with continuous changes.
We recall that "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" is accompanied by a charming young man who was born in Tennessee Williams, who was part of the Tennessee Williams process.
From recent times (1990) we can remember in the image of sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is faced with an old age by the fact that his marriage has not changed his hopes.
Besides Paul Newman, we saw a lot of other faces in his movies.
In his film "Denmark Down", Robert Wise presented an incredible transformation in the role of a violent criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano, originally intended for James Dean, and taken over after his death, he launched Newman's career as an actor in 1956.
He also played a sympathic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Big Claw", which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen in his genius film "The Svindler" (1961) turned into a bitter bulldozer and returned in a similar role to Martin Scorsee's film "The Color of Money". In 1987, he received a single Oscar prize from nine characters for the latter.
Different times, but always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The change in age has marked the period of her history.
The younger ones are known mainly for George Roy Hill's cultural film "Regie Dunlop" (1977), where he transforms Reggie Dunlop into a coach of a Ice Age Team who does not work with too much standard methods.
In 1994, however, his fans saw the "The Great Jump" recorded by Coen's brothers.
Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Creditation" closed in 2003: this was the last time he appeared in the role of a Irish mafia manager.
Unlike many cinemas, who had been leaving the film industry relatively soon, Newman remained in the reflector for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its hiccup, light and illustration.
Bertran Tavernier's French film director did not consider his game to be too powerful without all the humors.
However, the profession has not always been generous with the handsome Paul Newman, who, for a long time, had just fallen into his lap with the films.
Yet, young and successful characters played less often: rather, society's leading - nervous, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless - figures, who were able to restore their drive and rebellion with perfect credibility.
As a leader, Newman showed a less well-known face: a very sensitive and sensitive person of his soul.
In the film "Rachel, Rachel", held in 1968, with his wife, Joanne Woodward, a fine portrait of a melancholy woman from Canada.
With the film "Harry and his son" taken in 1984, he remembers Scott, his son who died in drug abuse.
A lot of admirers of Newman remembered the actor yesterday. His close friend and old combat partner Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Big Claw" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said: "Believe has made my life better and the world better".
The joy of generosity and existence: it was the secret of the vibrating personality of this great actor, whom we have just lost.
In addition to his legend's career, his remarks on civil rights, the environment, the independent film production and the defeats of Hollywood are incomplete.
We've seen your picture smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods.
However, income from such sales has always been referred to as a fund for children with a disease.
Newman has never been on his own: he has remained committed to the profession for the rest of his life.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father was always, and for all time, unbelievably grateful for the lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to be able to walk the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a citizen of all places.
What have you produced in Zuschlag & Tsai invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial against John Zushlag and his fellows will begin.
In particular, politicians and partners are accused of fraud and other crimes, including criminal offences, which cause serious harm to a criminal organisation, which continues to be and has been commercialised.
According to the D.A., the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often justified by unreal invoices.
The public and municipal funds, totalling about 65 million forints, were moved into the home of the Youth Left, partly into the pockets of some people.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the funds received were collected on the basis of cost accounts which had not been carried out, and the associations had never complied with the commitment committed.
According to the file, most of the invoices were fake.
They bought the bill blocks on these coal-fired markets, and they made the round-backs at Kiskunhala.
And what happens to the names of the companies was the production of the accounts, including on the road to the Lake of Balaton to which János Zushlag sent Stephen Lados.
According to his latest report, he had to look like a bunch of messages and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption, which was the model for which the accounts to be submitted to, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour records and the applications of the Capital Government.
Most of these were recorded by Stephen Lados, his partner, Andrus Tarri, who, according to our information, wrote the reports most necessary to obtain the aid.
One of Lados's studies was a beer house.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag, according to the two invoices issued in 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for the nine-person group of the Unit of the Commissioner Point.
However, as the manager claimed, they would not have been able to access the catering facilities at the same time.
For the same purposes as for the right future - together with the Third Year's Foundation - he was concerned about the form and content of the invoice issued during the summer of 2002 by the Foundation.
For there were only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, but the bill was about one hundred and thirty guests.
However, the fanciful print publishers were overstated even when they indicated Pigal Kft., which, according to the information provided to the prosecution, contained no documents on the right Future and the name of Hopppa.
The company's manager, Győr Farkas, toldvg.hu that when he was called to the D.A., he knew immediately that it was fake documents.
"Our company name and our tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: he did not agree with the fact that according to the account, a hundred people have been spent because they have eleven rooms, which do not have so many places.
In addition, the account was also about a meal, while their restaurant was not working long ago.
The zealous accounting agents did not follow any of the fact that the travel agency in Budapest, which they were looking for, only organises foreign travels, so they designated botorul Hungarian travel as a service on the cash account, which also agreed with the company's billing practices.
In addition, as the investigation revealed, the VAT was included in the document, where the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was unsubstantiated.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was errored on the four documents issued by Hotel Révffüp Kft. for the right Future, since the service of the company is not provided by the designated 25, but by a 15% VAT rate, and the employees of the hotel have only issued a machine account, but the completed account was hand-held.
In addition, the invoices were also damaged by the 'exhibitors' that, for a company, road freight transport was designated as an activity carried out - it was discovered through the Public Prosecutor's Procedure - which was not carried out by the company which was based on investment advice, which was originally based on investment advice.
In addition, the formal differences - due to an inadequate form of account, not a real stamp - have emerged that the accounts for the Third Year Foundation, the 21st century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point are fake.
As in the case of Camp Ravenna Bt. or the White House, whose representatives refused to issue the invoices.
For example, the fakers did not observe that the HIB Kft. was eliminated at the time (2001) at the time of the Youth City Association, which is why the company's winding-up assurance - as we know it - refused to have made the paper out by him.
They made it known.
The other group of invoice issuers are those who were aware that they had to issue a fictional account.
The Castle Budapest Foundation issued an invoice for the Third Year Foundation, at the request of Young Socialists, for about four million HUF.
The director of Collab Kft., according to the file, is one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, has taken him to issue a fictional invoice.
Zuschlag was also co-operated with the currently liquidated Biogate Kft., which, in 2003, provided the Foundation for the Right Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Fen Association with around five million forints, which had no real economic activity behind them.
No cash flow, because the completed accounts have been retaliated, but this has been forgotten by the organisations in their papers.
The next group of the issuing companies is those which are linked to the defendants.
Thus, the Ukrainian Executive Officer of Delta Trió Kft., based in Budapest on fuel and automotive trade, was Ivan Cubav.
The company also issued several invoices on the sale of IT assets in October, November and December 2005 in value of approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Kft., a Kiskuhalasi Cash Investment Ltd, who had been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
This company was the CEO of a Romanian man who would also have forwarded documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov, in the course of the investigation, acknowledged that he issued an invoice on behalf of kft to Atlas, the Hoppa and the Together to the Third Year Foundation and received their opposition.
At the request of Ivan Cubav, Romanian mammoths were founded on Fa-Bani Jos Faari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt., at the request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the defendant claimed was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, it is useful for companies, because at the request of their accused partner, Holy Zsolt, who also makes papers for the company, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zushlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade account for a total of 15 invoices in the value of HUF 14,2 million to organisations.
The D.A. considered that 10 percent of the amounts entered in the accounts and that VAT had hit Cuba's mark.
The man even used S-Beri Bt. to issue fictional accounts, these were manufactured for the tender of the Commissioner Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Association submitted a tender for Modern Hungary to the socialist party's public benefit organisation, the Dances Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand HUF, but the amounts were not spent for the purposes set out in the tender.
In order to ensure that this is not apparent, five fictional accounts received from Works Team Kft have been submitted to TMA.
These invoices were found, by the way, during the search of the Kemecsai Árpád in his office at the educational wallet.
A part of the defendants at the hearing, as well as at the D.A.'s office, is likely to report on the billing process.
Interestingly, if you are the primary defendant, János Zuschlag has decided to pick up the veil on everything.
His statement so far is not too detailed, and although he repeatedly promised to speak in every way, he has not done so yet.
Ask yourself whether this is the case, or perhaps the majority of the damage, in the light of the reimbursement of HUF 50 million, the Socialists made a deal with him and Zususus to take the fall away.
In any case, whoever may have been offended by today, since his applications for detention were constantly found deaf ears to alleviate the circumstances of his arrest, i.e. to put him in custody.
While the perpetrators of a much greater damage and non-returnable economic crime can walk freely or at least wait at their own home for the end of the ongoing procedure against them, they cannot do so.
It's the psychology of over-slicting: why are we giving out more money?
On auctions, buyers tend to issue more money, overestimate the goods.
The foundations of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been discovered by researchers from the University of New York neurologists and economists.
According to their study published in Science, people do not want to go down in competitions such as eBay's auction, so they pay too high a price.
The research tried to map this "play" nervous system pattern by using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was lottery, while the other group participated in a football auction, while the active areas of experimental subjects were examined by the method of functional magnetic resistance (fMRI).
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction, in which an important element of over-licensing the other party, the complex called striatum, under the name of the striatum, was active intensively when the game was lost.
This brain is involved in several other functions in the "retributor" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, price up can be explained by avoiding a sharp reaction from the striatum.
In support of their theory, the members of the research team have also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In these three groups, one partner was bided against under different circumstances.
The group was simply informed about the real value of the product concerned and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they were won out of the game, they would receive another $15 worth of money.
On the other hand, the third group received $15 just before the auction, but the group members lost this money in case of a lost auction.
The difference between the two groups was therefore just that one of them was stressed by the loss for the win and one for the other.
However, as evidenced by the hypothesis of the neurologists, the members of the team that played against the "lost" were willing to pay even higher than the group of control and "getter".
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
Because for the time being only with the joy of victory and risk avoidance, they explained the phenomena occurring at auction.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by getting us into a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, professor of the economic opinion of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should we contact a doctor?
About half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
One hundred people in the home are the number of hepatitis infected, but only seven thousand are treated for the reason: patients often do not know that they have been infected.
The name of the hepatitis is collected by various viruses in the collection of infectious liver charges caused by infection.
Their symptoms have many similarities, are characterised by inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and caused diseases differ between themselves.
Hepatitis viruses vary in two main forms depending on the pathogens: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (e.g., buttock, rabbit).
Travelers must have a worthy vaccination against viruses A and B, no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis may occur two or three weeks after the consumption of infected food, generally with malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, nausea.
After this, yellowing on the skin and the whites of the eyes, the stools become clear, the urine is dark, healing can take two or three weeks.
A million people worldwide die of more serious types of disease, hepatitis B-induced liver cancer and liver transplants.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one tenth of all infected patients are treated with medicinal products.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can also lead to hepatic impairment, liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease, because the pathogen destroys the liver cells below its limit, in many cases only the first symptoms occur in 20 to 30 years.
Then it is very important for early prevention, to carry out regular screening tests.
In three groups, there are far more than average cases of this disease: between people who have had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, 200 million people in the world are infected with chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease may already be detected in a routine laboratory study, it is appropriate to contact your doctor if you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
In time, recognising that the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, so that infectivity and cancers can be stopped and cancer preventable.
September 30th is the world day of hepatitis, which was first held in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
The aim is to draw attention to the importance of chronic hepatitis, the causes of viral hepatitis, and the early detection of the disease.
Do people believe in God, it hurts less pain?
According to a recent research, religious faith is a kind of painkiller that has already made it easier for Catholic martyrs to die.
Researchers from Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment to examine the way in which religion influences people's feelings of pain, reports the British Telegraph.
12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were considered electropolitics as part of a fairly strange study, while all of them were studying a painting of a Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of the pain.
The human brain has also been shown to be able to activate the part of the brain that was responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of studies in which scientists, philosophers and theologians, along with academics, are also involved from different parts of the university.
The investigation was quite precisely due to the strengthening of a rocking device to the left hand of the experimental subject, which provided the electrococtic.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look at two paintings, the image of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassórrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci with Hermelin, a picture of the 15th-century Lady's Hermelin.
The researchers of the investigation hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious status among believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it was soothing.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour on an MRI scanner machine, during which time 20 electrodes were received in four consecutive parts, while either a religious theme or a general picture.
Catholics reported that they felt "in security" when they saw the Virgin Mary, as they were "stowed" and "stowed" and "strettleed, peace filled them".
In view of the religious image, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was created in front of them.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who himself was involved in the investigation, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful effect, also with atheists, only the correct photo should be found.
"We should find a picture that they feel very positive about as a mother or a father." said the psychologist.
Bishop Tom Wright of England welcomed the results of the research.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases change our personality." said Wright.
After the excellent results, the question is, if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter show a picture of one of the Madonnas to believers, how would it affect their pain control?
Would the view of the quality Virgin Mary make even better results?
You are what you share about yourself.
On the tenth birthday of Google, you can tell us at least as much as you can find in people's pockets as above their heads in the sky; you know where they have vacationed, what special orders and what interests them.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of the company's main personnel.
But as far as sceptical scepticals are concerned, they do not see exactly the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main objective is to collect even more personal data on their users, and that is necessary to keep themselves to the original objective of Google founders, which said, "Let's get all the information on the world".
According to the contested Google CEO, after ten years of world filming work, the company will only be kept at the beginning of the process of handling all the information.
The question about what would happen in five years' time, Schmidt said: he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as "what to do tomorrow?" or "what work would really fit me?" - but until then, software can't answer such simple questions as questions as they don't know enough about users.
Not all internet sites are aware of exactly what type of email they are looking for and after searching for.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users, for example, can store their own surfing backgrounds, look back what you were looking for, by clicking on them, and they will generate more personalized results in the long term - they will be based on the Recommendations, which provide us with products and services on the basis of our previous described and fixed preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I do? - Ask users who are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company can be frightening, not guilt, fear of punishment, freedom, or even the rebellion against power in the Internet triggers the reactions to the Internet.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms requested are not only recorded but may, where appropriate, be passed on to a third party, in such legal cases, there is no protection for the personality rights of internet users.
Perhaps the most important example of the past was the coordinated action against the Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google handed over to the Brazilian government information on the pedophiles in relation to the identity of the pedophiles, which it maintained, from the Community side of the Orkus, which it provides.
On the other hand, internet users concerned for identity rights may have called up in May when the company successfully proved the truth in the court against the FBI in accordance with the e-Justice organisation of the EFF: in that way, Google cannot later be forced to supply any information that the FBI has secretly requested from the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out some 500,000 addresses and thousands of search terms, which were derived by reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act adopted earlier years, but still failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and the full website and keyword list covering two months.)
So it is quite controversial for Google to judge: people who hold their personal data are stupid because they feel that their intimate sphere and their personal life are being reversed by the fact that Google's services are being used and that the multinationals who are acting in a conservative impersonator stand up against them.
At the same time, the American Geek Culture and its many country-based, enthusiastic computer fans, activists, users are seeing the next generation of large-scale companies, the "happiness" in them, unlike rivals, Microsoft, who has been registered as a global conqueror because of Windows, wherever he can fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not ask for an identification code from users, does not request money for its application, open, free, constantly kept source code and package of software is much more accessible, younger or better than that of the official software policy practice.
However, it may also be that the genes have a clear overview of the very problematic relationship between identity rights and the internet, which is precisely one of the most frequently voiced keywords of recent years, the web 2.0 has attracted itself.
The web 2.0 is all about collature, we deliberately leave traces behind and use the communication channels we have at our disposal, and while the extent of them varies individually, the essence is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young community may also lead to profile from Facebook to Xang, these can be linked to other services such as Twitter or music habits with last.fm, and they can also be linked to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which are automatically displayed on Flickr or Picasán.
While we can read about a number of similar cases that show up: the girlfriend can easily figure out the picture price of a common circle of friends in the morning, seeing who he's been spending the evening with or can fire an employee of a company only because his sincere opinion of the top management in his blog: a sure, the concept of privacy has been completely overrated for now.
The person who lives online consists of what he shows from himself, making it possible to define the basis behind the behavior of today's young people.
And if you want to hide something, or at least want to avoid Google monopoly, you can do so (e.g. using your Google search system, but at the same time you do not deliberately leave a trace with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who do not wish to register on social sites is not enough, so that they cannot be contacted, the application of Google online can be replaced by alternative versions from the editor to the image editor and composer, which are not linked to giant server parks and which do not form the best profile we have ever had.
The public expects not so much secret when Google shows the protein of the tooth.
The current value of $156 billion of the company is worth more than the IBM ($140 billion), Intel (EUR 124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are threatening revenue from advertising agencies, and services introduced at an increasing pace are also causing serious headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
However, critical aspects are also found to be countering these concerns: for example, senior management has completely rejected the opposition of employees after calling on the company's guardianship fee, it has been too costly for corporate management to find that employees have been fed several times a day, but it is also a waste of the fact that Google has yet to head in 2006 in front of the Chinese Government and, under their agreement, the company will have every idea of harming good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company seems to not be announced in advance, only when it is already in use, but it is certain that the problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some people believe that Google's book and magazine and archive projects have killed sizes that the company will soon have to face with the Supreme Court of America, other people who are afraid of the Health system, because we can create a complete health profile with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide good material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novelist of the popular Cory Doctorow, Scroogled point orwelli describes the future in which a person can only be compared with Google’s data alarmingly well.
Two juveniles of two years of age have helped the Russian double killer in his persecution.
Two young men were questioned by the police in the case of the Russian double murder, and the well-found suspicions of being assisted in the prosecution of the crime, said the spokesperson of the Borsod County Police Command on Tuesday.
Young people have been admitted to the conduct that has been committed to their burden, currently accused of abuse.
Two young people, according to MTI's information, have released two girls.
Crime is also punishable by imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the Russian double murder was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday of a 23-year-old local man.
It is suspected of a pre-designed crime of capital gain, a crime of murder by several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old young man had a larger sum for a 53-year-old man.
The suspect didn't want to compensate for his debt, so on Wednesdays last week, he cheated his creditor on a cocoon site where he was killed, and then with his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was about to commit the crime, which is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun that was placed at the scene.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the weapon and its use with expertise.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - was proposed by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100-dollar stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is under state control.
99 % of the shares are held by the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60 % of the paper over a few months' time.
The Czech economic website of E15 is new to know that the Polish bid is the highest amount that has so far been offered by interested parties for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech tab, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse submitted an offer.
Petrblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week, stated that among the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and it did not rule that this would lead to the abolition of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to an age of 5 to 10 billion.
According to the shareholder agreement, about 90 % of the documents could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with around 25 % share, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 13,5 %.
From the perspective of the European pages from the perspective of the financial crisis from the perspective of the European tab tab from the perspective of the financial crisis.
The European newspapers leading up to their comments on Tuesday’s ongoing international financial crisis have already referred to as the second September 11th.
We owe the US President the global financial disaster - accused of the Roman La Repubblica - the president was unable to list his own party behind a legislative proposal that was established in his own wound to remedy the suspicious situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett's billion investor, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
A part of the Madrid press is in Washington, Washington, sees the crime scene.
According to El Mundo's vision, there was no political leadership there that led the world economy to the wind of collapse.
There is an increasing risk of collapse of the American financial system, and then the whole world will suffer.
At the same time, Bush's plan was not perfect, but following the Congress vote, the threat is that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the biggest changes in capitalism history is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - pointing out the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states may still provide rescue to the TSEs, and with taxpayers' money, they can be saved from bankruptcy.
However, if more banks collapse like domino risks, there will be no sufficient funds or new upsettings.
In the long term, it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union go beyond their national autonomy and concentrate on the control of the scattered financial markets.
Only over EUR 100 billion was received on Monday by weak financial institutions - the Vienna Der Standard, which says that there are growing concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, should be deeply involved in their pockets in order to remedy the crisis.
So far, the EU has not taken seriously into account the crisis, which is swept as a tsunami throughout the old continent.
The rescue workers don't have to spend a hundred billion euros in advance, but it would be nice if I fixed it: in which case it would be reasonable to extend to taxpayers' money the cost of preventing greater damage.
The flight of the dongo is emmimed by the intelligent car car.
What is the best way to develop technologies capable of avoiding impact, if not tracking obstacles in the natural world?
Like bees.
In the surprise project presented at CEATEC in Japan, dogó bees gave the strategic starting idea to Nissan engineers to build the next generation of the systems that avoid conflict.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built an BR23C-type bio-terrobo control system, a robotised mini-auto that has been handed down with bee properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all conflicts.
During the flight, every bee will form its own oval personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety shield cover - explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, director of technology PR and R & D brand for Kazuhhiro Doi.
The role of bee's complex eye is important, which in every direction can see more than 300 degrees in a perspective.
To copy that complex function of the eye, engineers reached the idea of a laser distance.
This BR23C detects obstacles within a range of 2 metres in the visibility field before BR23C, calculating their distance and sending a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which will immediately undergo an impact-free operation.
During the break of the second, there will be an obstacle, and the carrobe will be traced over the movement of the uterus, immediately changing direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid impact.
In any way, unlike the present system, this avoidable mayonnaise takes place in a completely inspiring way.
"If not, the car robot could not respond fast enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of the Mobility Laboratories and Auto-Robot project.
He must respond in an desirable and immediate manner, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of safety shields, a layer within which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should be missed in a blink of vision.
However, unlike bees, the difference should not be directed upwards, downwards or downwards, only two-dimensionals and only towards the turning of wheels.
In this way, instead of an endless possibility for bees to avoid other bees, only the current movement and acceleration and slowing was used as an option available to autorobot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and greater than their energy density, which means that their lifetime is longer than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the incentive for an intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less storage.
This device should process and react to only a few incoming signals per second.
It is not necessary to preserve them and respond to an intuitive logic based on the data of former manicuries, so it is constantly using only a few dozen kiloboves of memory.
There is no need for gauzes or even memory memory.
This is the first step towards the development of technology for immediate exclusion, which, according to Nissan estimates, can be included in serially manufactured cars within 10 years.
An additional application option may be the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to lead the car away from the specified target by avoiding obstacles to the road.
He's also named the poison child.
The written version was prepared to apply in several instalments to the $700 billion economic rescue package law for the purchase of bad loans from banks.
In the next round, half of the amount is spent.
According to the Eastern Party time, during the further negotiations until midnight, the Congress leaders have been convening in the debate about a total of $700 billion rescue packages for days - reported Reuters.
We have made a major progress - said Nancy Pelosi, president of the Democratic President of the American Parliament, who said that only the agreement had been put on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidents, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Mr. Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, said that the programme will work and be effective, but it is also necessary to do more.
The written version of the package was made public before two hours Monday morning in the Asian markets was opened on Sunday evening at 8th (i.e. from Central European time) but did not cause a spectacular run-in on the market.
On Monday, on Monday, the Parliament will vote on the draft legislation, which will be the subject of the programme, which will be called the Economic Emergency Assistance Act 2008 and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - declared Tony Fratto, the White House spokesperson of the White House.
By the way, the programme is different from the original proposal of Bush Administration, which would have meant that the $ 700 billion was spent simultaneously on the purchase of bad quality debt securities.
In the first round, up to half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent immediately after Congress is expected to vote on Monday, which is the matter where the Ministry of Finance buys back-to-back securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a separate panel, which will be attended by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion depends on the re-election of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combination of tactics: at the same time you can purchase bad loans, mortgage and mortgage-backed securities and other types of 'toxic' loans.
Within the framework of the purchase purchases and can be made directly - the competent authorities of the Ministry have been informed.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme, where the financial portfolio guarantees the means of concern that companies will pay a fee equivalent to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means for up to $ 700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system, either from a wide range of acquisitions or insurance, or from avoiding systemic risks to the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to prepare for the introduction of the law as soon as they sign it - he added it to it.
On the other hand, heads of banks in trouble and waiting for state aid may expect their withdrawal money to be limited by the government, which the overseas slang calls it simply a gold umbrella.
The restriction of payments will only be made in certain cases, and the limits will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
In essence, the restriction means that if you purchase a ministry in the context of a auction, you will be taxed on the gold drop-off screen unless you retire to a distributed bank manager.
At the time of the direct purchase of bad loans, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that management funds are not exceeded.
It includes the fact that existing gold umbrella agreements do not change, the restriction only applies to new ones so that they can encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs - he commented on the measure to be taken by the chairman of the Committee responsible for financial services at the House, the Democratic Party Barney Frank.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State has the right to acquire shares, so the risk of taxpayers is reduced, as they can eventually win on the transaction as soon as the economy and with it the saved bank recovers.
The draft act provides that for the next five years, the President shall submit a proposal to the Congress which provides for how to return to taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
There were, of course, on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us to do, that is, not to protect the taxpayers' dollars - declared by the Republican representative of Darrell Issa California.
A colleague of Ohio's Democrats, Mary Kaptur, believed that the measures were the same advocates who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices have increased by more and more price prices at industry prices.

Domestic sales prices in manufacturing industries also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent from July.
The largest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather product and footwear industry (2.8%), mainly due to price increases of 4,6 per cent in the case of case-law and 2,5 per cent in the production of footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials has led to a significant monthly increase in the production of chemical and product at prices (1.6%).
A reduction in the price of oil treatment (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery, manufacture of instruments (0.9 per cent) and - to a minimum - in the wood processing industries (0.1 per cent) sectors.
The prices of paper production, output and printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price increases between 0,2 per cent and 0.9 per cent were measured.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, the industry's domestic sales increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the prolonged effect of the official gas price increase carried out from 1 July.
Compared to twelve months - with domestic sales of the processing sectors - prices increased largely in the petroleum processing sector (32.4%).
The production of metal-processing products in the sector has been seen by 13.2 per cent, with 11 per cent increase in price in the production of food, drink and tobacco representing a significant weight.
The decrease in the production of textiles, textiles (2.5 per cent) and the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0.3 per cent) occurred in sectors.
In the other manufacturing sectors, price increases ranged between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
The processing industry as a whole has grown by 10,2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded 18.7 per cent one year earlier.
In August, among the target groups of sectors in domestic sales, the highest monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was shown in the manufacturing sectors of investment goods.
Consumer goods have increased by 0.3 per cent in manufacturing sectors, prices in energy and downstream sectors have not changed compared to the previous month.

The export sales prices of the industry forint increased by 1.1 per cent in August from the previous month and decreased by 3.9% in comparison with 12 months.
In a month our domestic currency decreased by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, compared to August 2007, by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro, by 15.9 per cent, compared to the dollar.
Don't you need a visa to the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance of entering into the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In his opinion, "now everything depends on whether or not the electronic access or control system will develop overseas in time".
He pointed out, however, that there would be no travel permit in the new system, but that tourists would have to register themselves before departure.
From now on, the leader of the Hungarian diplomat has started negotiations in Washington, Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will give the Republic of Hungary's Medal of the Middle East with the Stargáld awards and discussions with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and Foreign Policy Consultants of the President of the Republic of John McCain.
The bank rescue package is next to Barack Obama and McCain as well as Barack Obama and McCain.
On Sunday, both Barack Obama and John McCain, both the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, guaranteed the government's $700 billion bank rescue package, but there is a politician who still calls for the Minister for Finance to resign.
Following the negotiations of the Congress and the representatives of the Administration for the days of the marathon, it was announced on Sunday morning: a principle agreement on the bank rescue package was reached.
The crisis in Wall Street and the financial package to melt the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also claim that it is more suitable for them to withdraw the country from the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, Obama has once again benefited from some of the advantages of McCain, which, after the Republican convention, has been nominated by Vice-President Sarah Palin.
Obama at a Detroit campaign meeting on Sunday expressed his hope that the 700 billion package law will quickly be adopted by the Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer protection passports, which he also supported.
"Now we have to act with responsibility (...) your job, savings, threats to the entire industry, the stability of the entire economy," said the 35 thousand people in front of the crowd.
He didn't forget to call McCain's economic ideas over time.
McCain said in an interview with ABC, "that's all we're going to be hard to swallow (...) but nothing is simply not a walk".
The Republican Senator has indicated that the proposal included the setting up of a Committee of the Minister of Finance and the restriction of the end penalty of the seniors, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no real role in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi announced on Sunday that the House would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
It is the leaves of the German language area.
On the right side of the camp, only within the camp became more self-conscious of the voters - thus analysing the weak involvement of Der Spiegel in the CSU in Bajormaa.
Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (speegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the Bajorian Revolution, analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known polytologist, CSU's erosion started long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
Christian Socialists have been renewing Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of age is also the problem of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel's.
The failure was not quite surprising for CSU, but on Sunday the end of a process that was likely almost exactly ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of a state party ceased.
It has been ten years since 1998 that CSU landed at 47,7 per cent, for the first time since the 50s below the 50s level of 50 per cent.
This has been repeated for three years in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so during the so-called Stoiber era.
This is due to the consistently implemented modernisation of CSU in the region, which devours his parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, it could not have been without consequence for the choice of CSU's loyalty to the secularization, the educational results, the establishment of Eastern and North Germans in the developing regions of Bajormaa.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and its political consequences are also apparent.
The right-hand camp is intact, only within the camp became more self-conscious, more critical, and more self-conscious of the voters.
It is also noteworthy that, in the last few weeks, the civil groups were the most distant from CSU; free professionals, industrialists, graduates and higher education students.
CSU's support has already increased by 40 percent here.
Die Presse (dypresse.com)
In the article "Who, who, with whom? The parties will deal with the confusing domestic policy situation following the elections in Austria", they are dealing with.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of SPÖ into its internal affairs.
THE BZÖ is open to negotiations in every direction, the Greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
The election took place, everything is about the coalition; in the debate on public service television, the leaders of the parties hardly allowed an overview of their cards.
The president, Mr Faymann, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wishes to show that it is possible for the two parties to cooperate - in some provinces and in the social partnership that exists.
The question is whether a coalition with Wilhelm Moltererre - with the current President of the ÖVP as well as with the start-all - has been left open, Mr Faymann has left open.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was approved in any event.
It's not going to happen again.
Molter was careful to respond to red proposals.
As you said, you will certainly not be effective in cooperating if Fayemann is attempting to intervene in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
The fact that he chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is, for the time being, completely open to the party, the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
Mr Jörg Haider BZÖ President once again showed me that he was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take government responsibility" said Haider.
Járóka: The evil circle of poverty, segmentation must be broken.
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities started, which is France's host of the Presidency of the European Union this year.
Járóka Livia, the well-paid representative of the European People's Party, in his message to the educational segment of education as one of the main speakers of the professional consultation, pointed out that this is also one of the most serious infringements of the Roma children's rights and their enforcement.
The High Level Conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Commissioner Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The consultation took place among the most important representatives of European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the fields of governments, European social partners and equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Group of the European Parliament for the Fidesz Group, warned that, in addition to discrimination at work, Roma are mainly excluded from the labour market due to their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and due to poor basic education, only a minor proportion of young people can obtain higher education."
Járóka also stressed that, as fundamental human rights, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the representative, this connection is necessary to inform the broadest - including between Roma and non-Romans.
As soon as the Roma student starts school, the chances of becoming productive members of the labour market are increasing; they contribute to the national budget through taxes paid for income and consumption.
"The Roma must be entitled to guarantee their right to quality education in the European Union, and they must ensure that their low-quality and separate education is eliminated" said Járóka Livonia.
According to the representative, it is necessary to bring together the European Union's objective and action-oriented approach to the immediate acceleration of the demographic processes in the school, the correct enforcement of existing and planned anti-discrimination directors is essential.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segmentation, unemployment, that Roma children have given the opportunity of democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen" said Járóka.
In order to ensure for everyone in the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", the European Equal Opportunities Pact, which will be held annually since the last Berlin meeting, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace temporary time for temporary time.
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of the lost Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the nasty fall of the election, heads have not yet fallen, at the summits of the Bajor CSU, they have been celebrating the discussion of personal issues for the time being.
Mr. Erwin Huber and Head of State of Günther Beckstein are still in place, asking how long will mercy last?
On the last weekend of October, 17 per cent of the fate of the tandem that will be suffering the loss of castors will be decided by extraordinary party-responsibility.
In any case, the members of the many reputable couples have perceived that they do not insist on all their strengths on their chairs.
This led to the fact that the fact that the fact that the group and the base were angry with members of the family who, one day after "bajor cami", demanded personal conses for the loss of absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian Social Union has reached 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the Stover against Stoiber, it has only run 43.4% of their strength.
For 46 years CSU was a 'separator' in Bajorland, Germany with 18 percent of German GDP.
At the same time, the Conservatives are still highly expecting the Hungarian economy in a key southern region, and they will certainly be a coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of a party restructuring, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, who is a potential successor to Huber, and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, will also be present in the narrow-track investigation team that will start resting negotiations with the liberal FDP, along with the right-hand values of the Free Elections with a possible Munchen government coalition.
The strange finator of fate is that Gabriele Pauli, who used Huber-Beckstein as a pair of co-op possibilities for dealing with Stoiber on the list of Free Elections, and then she was completely treated with the ambitious government politician.
The CSU leaders are now turning all their energy into somehow stabilized Beckstein.
The transition will have an active role to date in the background of Stoiber, former Head of State and former Prime Minister CSU's political career, called the 28th September of September.
On Monday, Huber raised some epoch remarks to the CDU that he thought they deserved a lot more support from the brother-in-law.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel as well.
After the election of Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel cannot be Chancellor if the CSU, which plays a major role in national success in 2005 is not set up in a way that is not part of the common role.
According to Merkel, the loss of CSU's soil will not have a negative impact on Berlin's grand coalition.
Of course, it is relative: the injured CSU will not be easier to handle, and the crisis of social democracy will continue.
SPD has achieved the weakest results since 1946 in Bajorland.
Lukashenkoe: 110-0
None of the opposition representatives entered the Belarus Parliament following the election on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the wealth and stability provided by Aleksandr Lukasenko in the country which led it, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organisation (ESDP) it is possible to explain the irregularities committed at the time of voting.
The EEAS sending 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although a number of decades of lawmaking by hundreds of millions of countries, the opposition, which was summed up in yesterday's elections as the United Democratic Forces (ODZ), was seriously hoping that, following the constitutional amendment, Lukasenko, a quarter-time renewal of the mandate of President of the 2006 deputising elections, in Parliament, Mr Lukasenko's 'announced' election.
Thus, the OZZZ has also ceased to be a boy who had been previously considered.
In the background of the opposition expectations, Belarus, which has been economically increasingly dependent on Russia, was lending to reduce the import of Russian gas, and also contributed to the Russian hand-in-hand transfer of gas pipelines across the country, intended to improve its relationship with the EU where Lukashenko and several high-ranked politicians did not receive a travel authorisation because of the political deployment of Belarus as an anti-democratic.
It referred to a preliminary relief that, when assessing the election campaign, the OSCE placed emphasis on positive movements rather than on shortcomings, such as banning opponents from the third start of the opposition candidates.
However, on Monday's report, however, the EESC has already voted against the campaign - in which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press - and, in particular, that the opposition could not have been present at the polls.
Together, however, there is a clear improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in a smaller consensus with Moscow, and it continues to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is disbanded from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state, has been considered independent of the two territories for a month.
- We have taken two steps forward, one behind, but the most important thing is that dialogue has started between Belarus and the EU - said Aleksandr Milinkevics to our page.
According to his opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that "the power was frightened to allow either one of the opponents to enter the weightless parliament".
The opposition is not planning any objectionary action as a result of the results, but is trying to send a message to the voters about the necessity of economic reforms.
- We have a lot of problems with this, of course, we need to print the opposition pages in Russia, to put forward obstacles to local authorities, but I also see that more and more people are supporting change, including the elderly, Milinkevics, referring to the fact that Lukasenko's regime, which considers the main result of creating social security, even though the layer of officially supported pensioners is not appropriate.
Because of the country's debt, the increase in the commercial deficit, it is a matter of time before the social security damage of the 'suppressing silence' - said Milinkevics.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers declared elections democratically democratic.
Sergey Lebevez, the leader of the mission of the Union of the Independent States, said to the Russian news agency Ria Novostyi, "not the words, but the actions people believe in," so the lack of opposition is another evidence of the quality of the Belarusian voters".
Brunetta: "Regél only before working hours"
In the history of Chigi Palace, there have been uniquely reversed doors for the exit and entry of workers.
From today, this new measure will take effect against the lawyers, for the screening of those who are blocking and then they'll go get a coffee during working hours.
Today, the news was presented by Renato Brunetta Minister of Administration and by Mauro Masi, the Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The loopholes - said Brunetta - serve better and more efficient work, reducing deficits and increasing services".
"A more responsible and transparent period follows.
This is the real reform - he stressed Brunetta.
With Chigi Palace, the equipment of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers is complete.
Masi says "The installation of the screw cap is also symbolicly important".
The Secretary-General confirmed that the action was approved by the workers, and that everyone cooperated.
So it's over for breakfast at work, no more coffee and bris.
Brunetta smiles, and she says, "A good little cappuccino in the morning at seven a.m., he can do miracles."
At the Roman University of Public Administration College.
at the hearing, the Minister said: "In three months, the deficits in public sector workers have decreased by 50 per cent due to the disease, which represents more than 600,000 people in one year".
He added, however, that it should make Italian administration more efficient more efficient.
"which, according to the Minister, was twice the size of the private sector in the last eight to ten years, and much above the inflation rate."
At the same time, several thousands of civil servants gathered together, joining the submission supported by the Italian Organisation for the Environment and Consumer Protection Associations, in order to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"When the Minister of Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of disease-related deficiencies, "the war of the "immortal Suns" continues to grow", says the Consumer Protection Association.
Over the course of Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff have gathered together to communicate the illegal provisions of the Regulation."
The regional administrative court is, among other things, attacking the abolition of additional nutritional allowances for a disease that can be caused for the cause of service, the extension of periods of residence of workers in sick leave, which means the period within which the patient may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Work accidents: According to Naples, prevention is more important than all prevention.
In Italy every day, 2.00 accidents at work occur every day, 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilitys occur.
According to the accident insurance records at work, almost 1.200 deaths occurred in 2007 at the workplace.
The numbers show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and require almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today, Anmil will host the day of the victims of accidents at work in every county of Italy, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
"The worrying data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last days, indicate that there is an outstanding role in the prevention of accidents at work" - said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Giorgio Napolitano, President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to the President of the Baleseti Rokkants National Association at Work.
The Head of State respected "the permanent commitment of the association to the prevention of work, the protection of the interests of workers affected by the accident, the assistance of the victims' family members, and the delivery of public opinion".
"It is natural and honest to cause such aggravation by everyone, in their dimensions, of the tragedy of the media and public opinion, but in reality, we have to face the dramatic, re-reveloping circumstances of the day".
Napolitano openly states: "We have no doubt the lack of resources, the funding of education and information is crucial.
It is of particular importance that in-school initiatives aimed at providing direct information to young people on entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to allow attention to be paid to the social importance of the issue, as well as to the need for more effective legislation to be implemented.
Gianfranco Fini, the President of the House, stressed on his part that "the seriousness of the accidents at work, the social importance of all our consciences, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this type is still enormously high", noted Pietro Mercandelli, President Anmil.
"We do not, however, want this decreasing trend to come to an agreement, because it is precisely the worst tragedy that will happen at the moment of attention."
"We believe that, at a general level, we still do not do everything we can to combat the phenomenon, which could be resolved through a complex action programme.
We believe that more supervision and control would be needed - he stressed Mercandelli - as well as greater intervention in the field of labour training, starting from school education."
"There is a need for further efforts to inform and hold public opinion" he added.
What is most necessary, however, is a more responsible working environment against a phenomenon that poses a social problem.
Mercandelli then judged "the gradual deterioration of the protection net of compensation for victims of accidents at work" and "the aid scheme to which the system is suffering in recent years".
"The aim is therefore to restore the insurance security provided to workers, because the fate of those affected by the accident should not depend on the arbitrary measures taken by legislators, where the distribution takes place."
The MP3 player can cause hearing impairment.
Keepable hearing impairment may result in longer and high sound listening to portable player devices such as MP3 devices -
In its published report published in the Official Journal, the European Commission, the EU Scientific Committee on New and newly-identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), referring to a public opinion today.
"The opinion shows that those who, for a period of more than one hour over a period of more than one hour, listen with high volume to their portable composer" can be read in the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones are not aware of their irreversibly damaging their hearing", said Megena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk to which we need to respond urgently", Commissioner EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to provide consumers with information and a wide range of related information.
In light of that advice, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can function properly and keep pace with the latest technologies".
He asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in the light of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people who caused their noise caused by them.
"The researchers confirm that we have concerns, and the Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people who are exposed to noise caused by portable players and similar means", said a member of the Committee.
The current European Security Regulation sets out in 100 dB the maximum level of noise that can be released by portable music players; however, increasing concerns are accompanied by data on hearing loss due to excessive use of such sound sources.
However, solutions such as reductions in the level and duration of noise pollution are in place to significantly reduce these hearing damage.
In an expert opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, it explains that for those who use portable players who listen to music with high volume (more than 89 decibel) for five hours each week, noise is above the current maximum value of work noise.
If someone listens to music for a longer period of time under similar circumstances, there will be a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects around 5-10 percent of the users of the portable device, which in the EU could mean 2.5 to 10 million people.
Rome, Alemenno will set up the Committee responsible for the future of the capital.
Today starts, until March, the results are expected in June.
This timetable was set out by the Capital Government for the operation of the Committee on the Future of the Hometown of Rome, which met this morning at the new seat of the Catalala Bath House.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop Rome's guidelines.
Following the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the general assembly and the municipal committee in order to be able to submit in June a strategic plan of capital that has been officially approved by the Prime Minister of the Government and General of the Alemano of Gianni.
"This is an entirely independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented, stressing that Alemno is responsible for developing proposals on Roman development ideas for which political decision-makers, i.e. the General Assembly and the Government Committee may rely on.
There is no responsibilities for conflict of interest, we just wanted a platform where big plans for Rome could be created.
In March, after having done his work, the Committee will be disbanded, as it has a mandate for a limited period of time.
In June, we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the President of Rome - said the Prime Minister.
Those who consider the Commission to be superfluous, claiming that the advice it has put forward does not have a binding force, Alemno replied: "It all depends on what the Commission will do, and on the quality of its proposals on the table.
If the quality is appropriate, as in France for the Attali committee, which I am sure of in Rome, the contribution it has made will have an important role to play.
Policy is often divided into day-to-day affairs and in case of emergency situations that occur from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further beyond the long-term perspective and plan for a long-term period and are committed to working towards the development and future of Rome".
The mayor of Rome would point out that "this Commission is not considered to be a useless "waterhead" because it is absolutely free, it will not be in any euro for Roman citizens, but it will serve as an inspiration and aim to involve the best minds in the capital".
According to Alemano, "there is a need for an open-end and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump the quality of what it needs so much, thinking about its future in a united spirit".
About the future, which the Mayor of Rome stresses: "It will not only be limited to the current municipal framework, but it will look much further away", we see not only the future metropolis and the capital status, but also "the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region can play as capital cities, and what it must fill".
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A known, independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will become the second anti-American president.
It was Jimmy Carter who decided to ruin the American economy and maintain close relations (as he does as a private man) with my enemy Islam".
As the time of the elections approaches, attacks against Obama are becoming more frequent.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama in a faceless way believes that he can gain the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far been black by two governors and five senators!"
These attacks are in fact false; of course, they are racist, but they do not answer the question of the voters whether they will be a good president. Then there are the public polls: there is a sign that Obama will win, and there will be a significant recovery.
In that case, there is someone who listens to his emotions and not his mind.
Inside the southern United States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its main article: we know well that in the voting room, the real American patriot will vote for whom he will vote for.
There is a side of American thinking here that remains hidden for the last moment.
"Just talk about what you want, and we'll know where we'll put the ropes, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
They have never said such words until the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these things, the democratic winning weapon itself is George Bush.
You asked 1500 people about the mistakes that were made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent responded to Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they've failed to fly to home.
In Iraq 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans didn't have to pack up.
However, the majority consider that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
It is a huge task for the person who takes George W.'s place.
The US: the economic collapse has already been felt by journalists, and the time has come for red tapes as well. Many people blame the Internet because of the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute has asked five hundred American journalists how they feel about their future position and spiritual power in their profession.
Well, right now, almost all journalists' pessies about their own future.
However, it was not clearly stated that they would have reduced their concern about credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as before.
The problem with US journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure in an inefficient economic model.
A further serious problem is the restrictions on the editors of the newspaper.
If we do not want the traditional journalism, in the sense that what the public understands during this time, to a minimum, this problem needs to be solved - said the journalists asked.
Today, visible and complex pessimism is characterized by American journalism.
Sixty per cent of journalists and senior managers working in the printed press are convinced that national tyrannicalism is on the wrong way.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior senior management position.
Printed by v. electronic press.
Press staff are not having trouble seeing where the world network is headed.
The biggest publishers are breaking their way to the Internet, which many people believe is the murder of the printed press.
The 'economic pressure' perceived by the journalists increased to 79 per cent.
500 journalists admitted that they would put a voxa into technology, hoping that it might be for the benefit of publicism.
In today's U.S. press, there is a gap between the editors' leaders, i.e. the directors and the scientists who work for them.
At national level, 56 percent of the leaders are sure that their scientists share information with others, while at local level this rate can only be 23 percent.
Some of these are linked to a secure job.
At national level, 47 percent of the leaders fear that they may lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this percentage is 30 per cent.
In America, the question of 'safe work' is on the team level (in the case of our editors, cases) on the agenda.
Only 13 percent of journalists have a contract.
In case of a huge nation such as the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers operate, employers generally recommend as much as they want, so the thing works on the basis of "time or not" basis.
Directors generally receive a high salary, and editors can earn $100,000 a month in addition to the salary of pension and health insurance premiums.
Freedom, however, works rather complicatedly: in the first year x day, also in the third, until after a certain period of time it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But the American journalists, according to their own announcement, often get sick during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: THE BALIAN REPUBLIC OF THE DINILO COPOLA GRETT GRETT FRETT FRETTER FREZERLAND
Mr Carmelo Rinaudo, president of the second punishing sentence of the Rome Court of Justice, rejected Danilo Coppola, who wanted to go to a Roman apartment from Ghittaferrata, his place of residence.
There is an economic bankruptcy investigation against Coppola in the context of an investigation into the Unipol - BNL stock exchange agreement.
Last week, in the course of the proceedings against him, the house arrest was dissolved and changed it to the home leave ban for Gritaferrata.
Lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella have requested that the real estate man be able to cross over from the country's small town into the capital home of the capital.
However, according to the court, these gases (which the prosecutor proposed to reject) would allow the company to influence its cases and access evidence against it.
In danger, the elite elite is at risk.
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the Assembly did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package from the White House: the majority of the Americans were more interested and are still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs that the current crisis has resulted from a break in the Republican Party, which shows an ever greater disparity between the traditional, restrained, federal and business-led Eastern coastal attitude and the ever-enhancing new direction against Washington and the financial world in Central and Southern states.
This direction has been expressed in a critical way during the parliamentary vote referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic process that is still taking place is expected or will allow us to see, not only in the United States but also in the entire Western world, but also, perhaps, in addition to it, in the Western world.
It seems that the crisis, even in the US and Europe, has only speeded up the long-standing phenomena that are now being consolidated in this new atmosphere and will finally become visible.
The first of these phenomena is the re-advancement of the two categories of State sovereignty to public awareness of a re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis affects banking financial institutions which, at the same time, are in close contact with the rest of the world, but above all, and are rather widespread, involving people and families living in a single country in a single country.
However, this represents a direct political difficulty for those in the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are otherwise elected.
So the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in political terms almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially out of line: it is a solid evidence of the European Union, which cannot set a single policy path between different interests and national strategies that are different from one another.
So everyone from each national government is waiting for intervention, rescue package, recovery and new rules, but first of all, the opening of funds: since in a situation only individual states have economic resources, financial resources that can make things right.
They also have their assets and their powers to use them: in certain circumstances they have two sources of indepreciable value that are likely to have no other market and no international organisation will ever have such an extent.
In addition, the new focus on the nation state by the crisis is fully in line with the fact that recent economic growth represents an increasing importance of a factor closely linked to this principle: this is territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the ever more sophisticated technology into the philosophy world, and we were convinced that the global financial world had been ordered to dominate the world, once we had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were less and less than water, crop and oil.
From things that can be transported from one part of the planet to another, yet wholly into a restricted place, it can be linked to one area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more punch cards than anyone who has been born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I'd like to go back to the second novelty that's creating a kind of fracture line.
Who says that territory, state, government, it also says: politics, in other words leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis appears to produce two consensual phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition that credible leadership is needed is for those who are able to manage events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular the total loss of credit from economic leaders, who proved to be totally inappropriate and proved that many of them were facing a cloudy area.
The two together are even more important and, in a certain sense, more worrying: the feeling of credit loss, loss of patience, inability and separation, which is affecting the entire leading elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that the public's growing population is convinced that the social elite that has expired so far has expired. It has expired before their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, their culture within the meaning of the word, they would have made them their own.
The need for leadership, in a bold form, creates a multi-ordinary but strong delegation movement against the ruling division and the traditional political system. This is not reflected in the 'employment' of voters, or in the sudden changes in the public voice. For example, the emergence of conservatives in Austria and Bajora, the collapse of the working party unit in Great Britain, or the rebelling of the American Congress representatives against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the better side of Italy).
It seems that, with traditional elites, parties, programs and even more, we can say that in college with its customs, press and advocacy, he understands less and less and less that he can represent what has been happening for some time in the deeper parts of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is growing, spreading and potentially able to create ever more vague trends.
Nevertheless, it would, frankly, be too much to say about "the upheaval of the masses".
But keeping an open eye is no harm at all.
We can have a powerful super-power glue tape on the wall on the wall.
By using a super-power glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This objective has been set out by several American research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to the solution.
With only a 2.5 square-centimeter adhesive, researchers managed to tape and keep a body of 100 kg to a vertical wall.
The U.S. Journal S.A. published the discoverys of some researchers from the University of Days, Akron, the Georgian Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance that has already been invented by the group has been further developed by the development of specific, so-called carbon-carbon nano-carbon building materials.
"We have to imagine the principle of glue operating as a pipe system similar to a package of spray", says Zhong Lin Wang, a researcher of the transatlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
Researchers have drawn the idea from the feet covered with microscopic blinds in the gecko, which gives the animal a perfect grip.
Tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and flat paper, have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the feet of those seals, but "wet off the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher of the engineering arm of the University of Today's University of Technology.
FALON - "This substance can be useful as temporary adhesive" - adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think more of a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanopipes run well with heat and electricity.
You can find more applications in space research.
The superheroes can still wait.
THE MULTIPATION - the University of Berkeley in California is also conducting experiments with a new type of adhesive.
According to the article published in the American Chemical Society c., California scientists have presented a hairlined microfilm film that goes through self-cleaning during the movement of the surface, so that it always provides perfect touch.
It's not allowed with any fruit.
We need to keep an eye out for the praphruit, orange and almala.
These high-vitamin drinks, which are mainly popular during summer, if taken together with certain life-saving medicines, change their absorption, depending on the case, reinforced or reduced their effect, which may have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, Professor of Western Ontario of London University of Western Ontario, pointed out the risks of the combined use of bottled or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products. The professor announced at the 236 national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grape, orange or apple juice is able to reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice has already been placed on the defendant's bench before when it turns out that it is able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety, heart rhythm control, and ideals to a level that can be considered toxic.
CUSTOMS NAMES - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Medicine published the news in its official publication, and he also warned doctors and patients that they would take seriously the risks associated with these consumption and that they should take note of what they are drinking when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO GRAPEFRUIT - Researchers believe that orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
The list of active substances that inhibit the absorption of grapefruite and other fruit juices could be long listed.
Calls attention to Michele Carru, professor at the Medical Department of the University of Milan: "This kind of discovery is usually immediately addressed to the various national and international pharmaceutical agencies, who, if necessary, ensure that they change the particulars on the prospectus of the substance.
That is why you should always read the information about the medicinal product you intend to take, and if something is not understandable, we should not let ourselves be influenced, but we should ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly", emphasised the expert at the Institute of Ansa.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for the Economic Economy.
The American Paul Krugman received the Economic Nobel Prize to analyse the territorial context of trade models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman, at Princeton University, is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the lowest critics of Bush Government's economic and foreign policy measures.
After the September 2001 terrorist attack, a few months after Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted that the last event would have more critical consequences for the United States history than the collapse of twins.
This forecast has been very little debated and has been taken to the attention of the economist several times, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked that the collapse of Enron or Worldcom's scandalous collapse was quick to get past the public interest," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "roppt-value economist", but it is fairly "aggressively spreading its criticisms of the Bush Government's excessive liberalism."
Open Office, the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft package" was also understood by Open Office, the third edition of the third edition package.
Today, an open code application package that increases the productivity of OpenOffice.org 3.0 is published, aimed at a wider layer as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from free to administration.
After almost a year of work by SUN Microsystem and by voluntary developers, the new Open Office will take up a number of innovations to the public: outside the welcome screen and the re-thinked, less-sparing user interface, it offers several essential novelties. For example, it will support the compatibility with the Apple Mac OS operational system, as well as the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to the compatibility of Office 2007 with the system, so Open Office can also open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
An interesting feature of a few modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of Powerpoint presentations. This can be useful if you send email files. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into a theme format, by holding the site layout.
We can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on the same interface, which combines the typical Adobe format with table editor or text editor elements.
A number of developments have also been carried out in the application: the tab management supports the joint use of working books, but prevents rewriting each other's works. Each employee's comments are marked with different colors, which helps to identify more easily during the inspection phase.
Some companies have already been working to make some of the functions of OpenOffice available on the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so that the final version is likely to be presented in the weeks to come.
The Italian version, after you have received an English version of the millr pages since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
The package is available for Linux outside the standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can transfer the installation CD to our home or work.
Freeliness for home application is likely to be the most attractive for home application, but the Open Office package is now trying to play ball with the business sector as many administrative and school projects can also be considered.
There is no ideal lack of education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, the corresponding text editor to Word; Calc, a table manager for the replacement of Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbase is the most well-known Access Database Manager; and in the end, Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 target is to get 5 million downloads. However, if we take into account that the new version is already up to 3.600.000, this figure is likely to be higher than expected.
The result positive is also positive, it is already the fourth doping case.
At the latest stage of the Tour de France, another positive sample was produced by one of the participants, Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the Gerolsteiner team, who won the best mountain-walking trick in addition to my bronchel.
The news is on the Equipe Internet website.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer, the Italian Riccardo Riccæ and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German, also German, Gerolsteiner, after Stefan Schumacher, who held a positive result on the Cera test in the third generation version of the EPO.
Like the blood sample of Kohl in recent weeks, laboratories in the declarationanne and chatenay malabry have been tested.
If the tests confirm the positive Cera result, Austria will lose its third position and will, according to the standards, prohibit competition for two years.
The report on the positive results of Kohl's third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and informed Associated Press: he indicated the positive doping effect to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians managed to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, and also won the best mountain-spin trick.
DESIGNERS: THE NEW YORK IS THE MOST OF THE NAME OF THE WORD OF THE WORD OF THE WORD OF THE WORDS?
Italy has only recently converted from the country of migrants to one of the most popular destinations of immigrants who are attracted to it.
That's why it's turning into a racist nation called "Belpaese"? It's a question of New York Times, starting from Abdul William Guibre, Abdul Faso, young Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because he stole a box of cookies - he has dedicated a long article to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterised by what the New York Times calls "a "a paradoxone": in the northern regions, "most powerful is integration and the highest is employment", however, "the support of immigrants and the North League" is the strongest in the country.
In order to support the increasing tension between Italy and immigrants, NYT also cites cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by Liga, which would close the issue of immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, have been laid down as an example of the situation in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Presidents of the Pope and the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. He met with Benedees at the Quirinale Palace and said that the State and the Church cooperate together to combat racism".
Students suffer from expensive rental rental fees for students, including a room room with up to 900 euros, and a room with a room room with a double room.
The market for accommodation issued to universities is without prejudice to the crisis.
According to the most recent survey by the Finnish residents' union, a student can pay up to EUR 900 for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now been filled with amazing sizes, which, because of the total costs of the families, closes a wide range of students from the possibility of learning", explains Laura Marianni, head of the Finnish study office. "In these cities, high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general process of decline has started against local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers include a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts, contracts with no rent limit, fixed leases.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be necessary to maximise prices through the revision of the tax system.
The details of the survey show that in Milan, in Brianza, they also require 450 euros for a bed; the single room costs EUR 650 (Bande Nere's surroundings) to cover an average of 800 Euros ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can also reach 900 euros (in the vicinity of Vittoria).
In Florence, the average cost of a bed is EUR 350/400, a room is about 700.
In Bologna, where most students live in a nearby area of the university, one place costs € 250/280 if it is double and €370-500 if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), approximately EUR 600 is requested for a single person and 450 for a bed in a two-bedroom bed.
More cheap (550 euros a single room) prices in other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In suburban districts, all savings can be made: €300 per bed and 450 a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they are asking for EUR 300/450 per bed, for one room from 400 to 600 euros. The price is the highest in the areas of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
Bariban has to pay 250/350 euros for one bed and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower than absolute, but they represent a higher weight within the city's buffet.
In cities such as Peru, where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, another disorder can be seen: the rental charge requested from foreign students is around 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye old Cinema Paradiso, in the cities the time of the old cinemas was a sacrifice for the cities.
Traditional cinemas close in favour of Multiplexes.
"A city with no movies is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Towere are presented in an effective way as to what is happening in the Italian capitals, but also in rural regions.
The narrowing of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-territorial cinemas in the suburbs and, as a result, the repression of one-territorials in urban centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it takes all the characteristics of a genuine cultural crime.
When places of history and memories disappear, "it's like a friend who goes away, a friend we shared with, and a lot of experiences", says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which meant Oscar Awards 20 years ago, and the grand prize of Cannes Festival, tells the story of a small-town cinema in Ireland, a dream, after a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, has clearly been closed in the last five years: 316 traditional cinemas have closed. The largest losses were recorded in the movies in the cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin, and 5 Palermo.
Emilia-Romagna is one of the most affected regions, which has lost 82 one-time cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that their disappearance is precisely because of their disappearance, we have no more proof that Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-territorial movies in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of crops in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same number in Emilia-Romagna has increased by 195 in the last five years.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally", says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It is important that we build new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not all of us are willing to go over to multiplexes.
Not to mention the outstanding financial resources intended to support operators: the State's outstanding debt can amount to around EUR 10 million.
In ethical and moral terms, it is disgraceful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
The maintenance of the market would require EUR 16-18 million per year".
This is the first Italian city that, in its concerns about closures, has decided to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and boost one-off cinemas from outer and downtown.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers could enter the restricted areas and park them with a reduced tariff in certain parking areas.
"This initiative is a success," says Giuseppe Towere - "and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the power of multiplexes, must improve voice and image quality, because today's audience is much more demanding than today's audience.
Protecting the traditional cinema was always an important issue: closing Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and my childhood, she gave me that spark, which led me to Cinema Paradiso, even though I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I'm going to the closed Rialto or Quirinale, when I'm on the via Nazionna, so that I don't see the covered posters of dust, I'm turning my head around. I've had enough experience here."
Close lines between politics and 'nndrangthea, arrested Mayor Gioia Tauro of the mayor of Tauro, the mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"Gioia Tauro's mayor supported the interests of the Pio model clan in municipal decisions."
There were serious accusations against the mayors of Gioia Tauro and Deputy Mayors, Giorgio Dal Torrine, Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external participation in a criminal conspiracy.
Bililcs has been transferred to the hands of Giaacchino Piro model, the senior intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and a lawyer named with the boss, who has been convicted of participation in a mafia-like criminal association and has been rewarded with EUR 10 million.
"The failure of any legal or moral rule, more good taste," says the public prosecutors. The two local governments have expressed their intention to pay Piro model lawyer a fee for a consultant.
"So the clan would have officially entered the city hall, which would have provided an additional opportunity for the control and management of public administration, which could already have been significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the Calabri region, does not tell us that there is a "a wide range of games between local institutions and organised underworlds" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mob is stronger than elsewhere where the play is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians are resisting the pressure of the 'ndranghea', they are the heroes who remain clean.
This morning's arrests are the events of the July events, when the police announced that they were able to clear up the Pirop model clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate for the administration of the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was already disbanded once in 1991, even because of the alleged mergers between organised crime and local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Mayor of Christian Democrats, renegotiating at the time of disintegration, took the lead in the media coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried out a scandal when Mindeháza ordered the municipal council to be disbanded.
The then Minister of Home Affairs introduced Marco Minnii to court and accused him of planning everything with a political purpose. However, the court stated in the arrest warrant signed this morning that Piro model-klan has dared to demand that the A3 project be changed.
The hearing against the Dal Torrion turns out to be written by the public prosecutors - "it was necessary to meet the entrepreneurship claims of a large group of people representing a well-knownly close group of Piro model families, and to submit the decisions of the municipality to the Clan arches."
The energy is coming from the waves, and now the big ones are coming.
An exhaustive source of energy that accounts 70 percent of the surface surface of the planet, and which is just now discovered by large international energy companies.
Hulls, sea currents, floods and renewable energy sources, where giants like Chevron are now trying to put their hands on them.
They've been researching for a hundred years how to gain energy from the movements of the sea. In the '70s, research has increased during the first oil crisis.
In 1980, when oil prices decreased, the idea of using marine energy has been reversed, but today the renewed increase in environmental needs and oil prices will give the sector a new boost.
According to the 2007 London World Energy Council (WEC) estimates that 15 percent of the world's electricity demand could be covered by facilities that exploit the wave of seas.
This quantity is twice as much as is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, currents and floods would still be there.
The giants are in motion.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to maritime energy, and in 2005 it signed an agreement on a power plant to be established in North Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
It's been two years since then, and more and more companies are taking off their fleet next to maritime energy, including those who have been dedicated supporters of traditional energy so far.
Chevron studied ocean energy-using technologies and considered the possibility of co-operation with us," said the speaker of an American oil industry, the Wall Street Journal's economic newspaper.
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining the authorisation necessary for the launch of a project for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee in the Netherlands.
It is not important, especially if we consider that the USA is in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drillings.
In addition to Chevron, the Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey Ocean Power are on the road to energy from the sea.
Technology is waiting for development.
According to the experts, this is still an initial technology, just because the energy from the sea does not dispel the doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing establishments similar to Portugal or Scotland are small and therefore do not cause too much trouble for the ecosystem.
However, in order to be able to generate energy at a higher level, installations that have a higher environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a combined bonus system.
The push-offs generated by waves and moved up and down by the waves will turn the plungers and cylinders in them into hydraulic pressure.
The pressure is turning a turbine, and it's feeding a generator.
The electricity can reach the surface of the ground with cables drawn below the sea.
There are also four similar types of facilities in the planning phase, which are now only waiting for a federal permit. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started energy production for a shopping and parking lot by means of six submarine turbines located in New York East River.
At the time of the flood, the movement of the water turns the shovels of the turbines, and this movement is causing the generator to function.
Verdan has stated that he has a long list of partners who only expect the necessary authorisations to use energy.
It's raining after hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hooahs.
At present, there is a difference in the range of options that can be used by the price bar.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, the flood is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, so it can be considered a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 to absorb the energy provided by the flood, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
