A 9-year-old boy who had been running the deserts in Tampere was found found found found a 9-year-old boy who ran away in Tampere.
The police have had a search mission for a 9-year-old boy's escape trip in Tampere on Tuesday night in the night of the night.
The disappearance report on the boy leaving from Western Tampere with his friend has spread through social media.
According to the Police Department, there's been a connection to the boy, and he has no life and health hazard.
The son's father told Ilta-Snom about half the night knowing that the boy was found.
He's all right, and now we're gonna start ex-post investigations.
The boy was found in the neighborhood near the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo again in a fessy - ripped the paint between Messin and Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals at the Spanish league weekend and continued its factory at the Masters' league as well.
The struggle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Magistrate of the Master's league turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goal-makers statistics when he shot a visitor in the Shahtar Donetsk network with two shots of punishments and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his painting to 80 when, before Tuesday, before Tuesday with him, he was standing with the Barcelona Messiah with 77 matches.
Real won a game of four-0.
Juventus has been in the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the D-section of the Master's league, it began with a two-to-one guest gain from Manchester City.
The victory was done by over ten minutes before the end of Juvenus Alva Morata.
From the city attack, the absence of Sergei Aguero, the knee leprosy, bored the absence of the knee lemurs.
Aguero came to the field only the last ten minutes of the day, who was injured in the election match on the weekend.
Also, the second Manchester Society, United, experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering from 1-2 losses.
The 20-year-old ManU's visit to Luke Shaw will only take a quarter of an hour.
The dangerous-looking slide suit of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the paint on the manU package that was attacked so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw was lying at Eindhoven's home stadium tens of minutes before the medical staff left to drive him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests 41 minutes to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno made up for extra rest.
In the second half of the year, Luciano Narsingh made a profit for the PSV.
In the league of the Masters of the Agriculture season, the A-block started with Paris Saint-Germain.
There was an Argentinian Angel Di Maria who changed the PSG for Manchester United's shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and picked up the back of the ball by Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half of PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been taken over among the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the league's lengths, is not the best possible benchmark destination.
For the first time, the star-seeker of the PSG Zlatan Ibrahimovic met Malmö FF his professional career for the first time.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow, TsSKA, lost a B-block match in Germany for Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition's opposition party demanded immediate separation - the president gave the wrong speech.
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe has once again held the same speech in the country's parliament that he held at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not realize, during his 25-minute speech, that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether a 91-year-old Mugabe is in full life's power.
The MDC has asked Mugabe to resign from his duties because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed in to say that the confusion had just happened in Mugabe's board and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now the impact of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis in Germany and Austria for an additional summit on the refugee crisis.
next week, Germany and Austria have presented an additional EU-led summit of EU leaders due to the refugee crisis.
The European Council President Donald Tusk will assess the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe can be more effectively registered.
The negotiations on the allocations for asylum seekers are made by Merkel on the table of the Minister for the Interior.
The teacher admits the teacher admits that she shot her girlfriend during an emergency call while she shot her girlfriend during an emergency call.
Sounding just a little bit of a college teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "Dear dog" was alive and probably shocked, and also said that the contact information between a dead woman and a dead woman could be found on this phone.
The police inside the house found Amy Prentiss' body and the hosted message on the side: "I'm so sorry I could cancel this beloved Amy and she's the only woman who's ever loved me," said the letter from the experts that was signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to a school campus where police believe he shot and killed a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study room.
The head of the Delta State University Police Department Lynn Buford told the staff of the University about the six-month shooting of the shooting at 10.18 p.m.
He said Lamb had called a fatal emergency call a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of deaths increased by one more: Lamb committed suicide while the police were stationed.
The authorities were still trying to find out Lamb's motive day after the students and the staff had to hide behind locked doors because of a school trip.
Researchers on both sides of the state have published information indicating that students and staff described Lamb as a talented teacher, but that there may be problems.
The students told me that they waited for her hours.
The police at Prentis' place of death, Gauterer, say that Lamb had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb's book in which he thanked the great people with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many students took part in the courses of both men and women.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers complimented Lambia, but said that she also seemed nervous and restless, "as if something had been wrong".
Another student, Mikkel Sykes, said Lambin told me that he had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for a sick leave from Delta State University, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s remuneration policies meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for his doctorates, it did not back him the automatic career development and the post of assistant professor.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that he knew there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that " clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb had escaped from campus, the police came after him when he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas State.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a half a mile south of the house of his parents in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, told methe D.C. County’s death investigator Methel Johnson.
The Lamb's car was still on the road.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew people living there.
He grew up in the area.
She started her work at the University of 2009 and taught on roads and education. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
She completed a doctoral degree in education in the spring of spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me he was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met with friends together.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried to teach Harston for many years to play guitar.
He was quite a charm in those days.
All the girls were melting wax when he was there, told me now that 40-year-old Hairston lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
At the wedding, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but there is no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a riverside brickhouse in Gauter.
The police told me the dog was okay.
Prentiss' former husband Shawn O'Steen told me that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset", O'Steen described his daughter.
He was his mother's best friend.
O'Steen told me he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and called blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together at some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different network companies.
At the bar near Gautier, the bar at The Jules Room and the time-time entertainment planner Mike Shaffer says that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night on September 5th, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip-art presentation for the audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We used to play games and throw fog into each other.
So they were both quite clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year's student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, reported the school's English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married, and he had three little children.
He studied at the State University of Kansas and was the chairman of his brotherhood and student government.
Tuesday night, in Cleveland, Delta State, a candlestick was held at the Delta State campus, involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the Mass, during which the University Choir sang songs in Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi from Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagner Pettus from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected by the police saying that Lamb has now called an emergency call after Schmidt's shooting, and that even though I referred to Lamb during the call to Prentis as his wife, there is no evidence that they would have been married.
Toys R Us is planning to hire fewer employees for the holiday season Toys R Us Us plans to pay less employees.
Toys R Us says it does not hire as many employees as last year for the holiday period, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current regular and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres throughout the country, while the number of employees employed during the 2014 holiday period was 45 000.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that interviews of applicants will start this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday time, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the occupation of shops and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is having a joke with Princess Diana about her "t date" Princess Diana.
Back to the first night of the movie, Michael J. Fox was a professionally important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also significant for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royal arrival, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," he said, "he would become a documentary movie at the Back in Time trailer."
The movie starts and I think that I'm just a doppelganger and a hand stretch from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a document from the Return to the Future film that was interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and CEO Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future, she got her first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me, "To me, it's certainly the most amazing time travel movie of all time."
Back in Time is available as a subscription video, DVD and some movie theatres in October.
UN Head of the UN President says that the situation in Syria will not be resolved armedly.
The answer of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "no armed solution", and additional weapons only worsen violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN Director again called on all parties, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support no non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
In the Middle Week press conference, Ban reported that he was going to meet five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - Foreign Ministers for the General Assembly later this month in order to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the breakdown of the Council, the Syrian people as well as the regional forces " has made the situation impossible to resolve.
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate solidarity and consensus in dealing with the Syrian crisis, as they showed when they agreed on Iran's nuclear programme.
8 of the support results showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some people have tried to stamp him into a windmill.
Others think he's just a joke.
It's part of the collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trump away from the top of their support claims, it has not been (vilä) successful.
Of the last 11 national surveys, 10 Donald Trump has been in charge of a two-digit series, and some have started to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's appointment.
The election season is, of course, only early.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be a Republican candidate.
Comments point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing control of Herman Cain, one of which neither received one state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and a conservative economic organisation Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump's resilience and have started using its funds to take over him.
The following recent evidence of support claims suggests that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
The most popular figures have made a complete translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, Monmouth University's statements of support showed that only two Republicans from ten of the 10 were positive about the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of ten Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In Iowa, last week, 60% of Republicans reported that they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be happy if Trump became a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week 67% of Republicans said that they would either be "incented" or "confirmed" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "damaged" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson makes the greatest of the same levels of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of 'inspired' vs. Trump's 40%).
The next most exciting thing to do next is get you excited?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "defeated" if the Presidents' favoured Jeb Bush would be a candidate.
The character of the Trump Fire is not the problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his great talk and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post-request, 52 per cent of the elected voters at national level think that the real estate king has a suitable character for the President.
According to the study of the Quin market last week, the number of Iowa States organising the first convention is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has a suitable quality for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Post survey, 44 per cent think that his character is not suitable for the president's functioning, and nearly six out of ten believe that his character does not belong to the White House.
Republicans get used to the idea.
When Republicans think like commentators, they think that Trump is a real alternative.
According to CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten considered Trump the most likely option when asking who is most likely to be appointed candidate for Republican Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten supported Jeb Bush.
Publication: The Republican voters have always not had the brightest possible crystal ball available.
At this time of the last parliamentary term, four of the ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was appointed candidate and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of the voters of the Republican Party consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Even if Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the sirale field is likely to have contributed to the Trump leadership, since the support against Trump is divided among a number of other candidates.
However, at the beginning of September, the survey carried out by Monmouth University showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump will receive the majority of the aid in almost all cases.
He lead Cary Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bushia at 19 points as well as Rand Paulia, John Kaschia and Chris Christ Christie every 33 points.
He's at a level with Ted Cruz.
The only Trump winning candidate?
If they were put on the opposite side, Ben Carson would win the businessman Trump's big 18 points apart.
It is precisely the majority of Donald Trump's supporters who have announced that they have taken a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that just over half of the most profitable voters have decided who will be voting for their votes.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can absolutely say that it would never change his mind.
46% reported that they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, the biggest racer in the Trump right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely to be on the Trump side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "raisers" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the centre of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's power to drive Latinists further away from the Republican Party and to harm brand companies.
According to the new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of matters, so too is Donald Trump.
The breakup of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday in the ABC/Post survey that they would rather choose a non-political person than a person with a government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Des Moines Register/Bloomberg's survey from Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republicans have become frustrated with Republican Republicans in Congress: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% "dude angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first priority for the Prime Prime Prime Minister's Question Time at the Prime Prime Minister's Question Time at the Prime Minister's Question Time at the Prime Minister's Question Time at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first approach at Question Time has been eagerly expected from his choice from the start of his choice.
The new Director of the Labour Force Party Jeremy Corby is meeting David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby will rise to ask about his first six questions shortly after midday, and probably both the media and the Labour Party's representatives were looking closely at his performance.
Corby has demanded this weekly show "less theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave part of the opportunity for his colleagues to handle it.
This meeting is the first parliamentary trial for Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and he spoke at the annual meeting of the trade unions' Central Organisation on Tuesday.
At the same time, the decision of the Director of the Labour Party to stand still during national singing during Tuesday’s memorial service, which was held in the fight against the United Kingdom on the 75th anniversary of the World War, has raised criticism of the Conservative Party’s representatives and has appeared on several front pages.
Corbyn's decision not to sing a national song has attracted attention attention to the decision by Corbyn not to sing a single national song.
Corby's representative said to him, "It's an honorable silence", and he confesss "The bravery of the Royal Air Forces in the British Air War."
Member of the Corby's shadow government, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight program that he would have invited the Director of the Labour Party to sing national song despite the fact that he felt that the Kingdom Hall should be abolished.
Almost a dozen military ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's interior, calling on differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Originally, less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the policy differences concerning the position of the party in the European Union as well as the government aid ceiling have been "recorded" also within the Labour Party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Corby said at the meeting of the Centre of Trade Associations that the Labour Party is proposing an amendment which would remove the whole ceiling.
Hours later, the secretary-general of the shadow government, Smith, stated that the party was "very clear" about the fact that they only oppose the government's plans to calculate the ceiling from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn becomes the fifth Director of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has encountered during the last decade when he has been the head of the Conservative Party.
The Director of the Labour Force has promised a new approach to politics and is now telling us that he has "combined" ideas for the Prime Minister and received more than 30 000 proposals.
Corby, the representative of the Islington North, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too conflicted and that he intends to abstain from both clever terms and chanting, but instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Corby has said that Ms. Angela Eagle, the Secretary-General for Economic Affairs of the shadow government, is his substitute for questionnaires when Corby does not participate - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues might sometimes be given the floor and he has said that he has approached the President of the House, John Bercowi, from the front of the matter.
When Cameron came to the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move away from a political theater that is often combined with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he had to admit that he failed.
Since the start of television in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the director's discretion, the management of his sub-room, and his position with other representatives, even though critics have criticised the fact that they have only become a fictitious picture that requires far-reaching reforms.
Pictured in Joburg: Home young people are being trained as photographers for photographers in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers.
The downtown of Johannesburg is a difficult place to be homeless.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take pictures of their neighborhood and gain victory from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who graduated from the first project.

The value of pounds will rise as the UK's wage growth rises as the UK's wage growth rises, when the UK's wage growth is increasing, it will increase as the UK's wage growth is rising.
The value of the pounds jumped upwards after the figures seemed to rise in the UK wage increase, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller’s bid item.
Between May and July, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009 and was considered to bring with it an assessment of the rise in the courses.
The premium rose by over 1% against USD 1.5055, and by 0.84 per cent against EUR 1,3730 per cent.
The FTSE 100 index was closed to 6229,21 by the increase of 1.49 per cent.
SABMiller was the most different stock on the market and rose by 20% after the competitor AB InBev approached it with a bid.
It would connect two of the world's largest brewery and bring together brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry stock rose by 0.9 per cent after the encouraging news of the competing luxury product group Richmont.
In addition, the latest sales figures of Richemont were better than expected, and they showed that sales in China - which is Burberry's key market - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 per cent after the mining waste told me that it had raised $2.5 billion by issuing shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Package and Paper Group Mondi's share shares were the largest decrease in the index by 4.3 per cent after the Goldman Sachs changed their recommendation from the company to the form 's sales'.
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports audience announced half-year's income before taxes: an increase of 83 per cent to 46,6 million pounds.
According to the director of JD Sports, higher wages may harm enlargement.
Peter Cowgill, director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the United Kingdom, it may mean that "the purchasing power of potential consumers is increasing".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill states.
The costs could be related to the company's enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash will start a grass-root-level campaign against intangulation in Aldi.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA store from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash has launched a grass-root campaign to defend the market share of IGA dealers in South and West Australia before the attack on Aldi $ 700 million.
Aldi prepares the two distribution centres and the first trade to be opened early next year to Southern and Western Australia, with up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local restaurants and build IGA brands through power and social media marketing, as well as through events such as the Adelaide Show exhibition.
IGA traders and suppliers have jumped in, and brands like the ice cream maker Simmo's from Dunsborough offer taste in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount-cost tickets to Australian football matches with their customers.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron is organising the annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot to play, as South and West Australia account for nearly 30% of the area of Metcashin IGA stores, with profit margins higher than the IGA network of the Eastern States of Metcashi.
Visitors are known for shopping in the South and West Australia, and IGA dealers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: over 30% in the south and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will catch about 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening up the first movements.
In this week’s report, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash can lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up in the south of 25 and west of 30 movements next year, resulting in the turnover of USD 500 and 600 million in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities at the base of high fixed costs of Metcash can cost Metcash some $113 million of operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash loses its market share in eastern states mainly for Aldi and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan investigation found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week's manager of the Investment Fund and founder of the Magella Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said at business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "may well be lost in the decade".
Metcash has refused to reply publicly to Douglas's comments.
However, it has been understood that the member of the Board of Metcash would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, the market share of IGA has decreased from 18% to 14% since 2010, and the yields from Metcash's food and food business, which distributes products to about 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012. This is about reducing the debt financing of the activities when sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler keeps half of it, and has invested over $150 million a year in calculating the prices of hundreds of products to the same level each week with Coles and Wolorths, helping IGA dealers to repair shops by increasing faster growth in fresh food, and bringing a better range of private brand products to the market.
Ian Morrice, Director General of Metcashin, says that the fall in prices and the improvement of shops have increased the leverage, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of returns in 2017, for the first time for four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union, supports Thanasi Kokkinnaki
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism about his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer as a member of the recent storm, which has hurled around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves honor rather than criticism of his own behavior, says Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis union.
Kokkinakis, a senior member of a talented twin named "Special Ks", was unwittingly exposed to a case in which Kyrgios was annoying by Stan Wawrika in the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon thereafter, in an intangible scratch fight in Cincinnati, the Supreme had twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: "Wawrinkan should have been beaten by Kyrgios, and I should be beating that cock."
Even though Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up their land after the crack ruined his possible victory from Richard Gasquet in the US Open, Healy has been the unspoiled defenseman of Kokkinakis.
Right now, the young man is at Glasgow to compete with Sam Groth about the second place in doubles with Bernard Toic at the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I'm pretty sure that your Thana has just been dragged into the ruins," Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost his grip because of the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I feel well enough to know that Thanas isn't proud of it.
But he has behaved well, also in quite provocative situations in the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves compliments.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a nice family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature at 19 years of age, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had any problems with other players. He is appreciated in the dressing room, he is working hard, is in good condition and is quite peaceful and mature as a young man, and I think he should be assessed according to his merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to join Kyrgio in the important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good solution for all, but while still supporting the Canberraan return to the team's regular platform.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not on everything around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, as, for example, Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he is growing up in public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserve all the criticism he has received. However, we are trying to support him, we are trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the publicity to reflect on these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants.
Hungary declared the state of emergency and closed its southern borders against Serbia, with the exception of those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of daming the flow of migrants to the country.
At the border, chaos followed when hundreds of migrants gathered in an neutral region, and the Serbian authorities reacted with shock.
The people who fled their homelands' violence have now set up their tents and have set themselves up for an indeterminate period of time between the inspection posts of the two countries.
However, corruption grew.
While the police helicopter remained above them, immigrants would "Open the border" and yell at the Hungarian mellow policemen for violations.
Some refused to protest about food and water.
The Foreign Minister of Serbia declared that it was "unacceptable" for migrants to return from Hungary when they arrive more and more from Macedonia and Greece all the time.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, no harm to civilians.
The debate will take place in the coming days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion between Hungary and Serbia was born after a group of 28 nationalities failed to create a common immigration policy in Brussels at a controversial meeting.
Ministers agreed on the allocation of responsibility for the 40 000 people who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers were hoping to speak with a view to reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - about which EU countries will receive 120 000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will be calling for an extra EU summit next Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will be operational in the near future.
On Tuesday, an emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to act in a crisis and enabled you to be closed and asylum cases speeded up.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that it is ready to assist Serbia, the country will also set up a section of the cross-border fence against Romania to stop the flooding of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners had been recruited to complete the cross-sectional fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over recent months, Hungary has become the largest blockade and its place of arrival for refugees in the European Union, many of which are the war on their way from Syria and other parts of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, and not escapeers from war who are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, now define as a crime an attempt to cross or harm the 4-meter (13 feet) barge fence, built by the government on the southern border of Serbia, and contain extended prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government declares the emergency situation", the government’s editor Zoltan Kovacs told journalists in the southern city of Szeged.
In fact, we are very clear: crossing the external borders is a crime.
Parliament still needs to be formally accepted for the next week by the expected military position, but the suppliers of Associated Press at the border have been seeing for days heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
Gyorgy Bákoni, Homeland Security Officer of Orban, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their attempt to cross the border, and 15 already beyond the border.
They were overcome by damage to the fence, are now imprisoned by the police, and they are accused of infringements defined in new laws.
The authorities will quickly fix the fence.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two seven crossing points from the border to Serbia after they had sent a train covered with a cross-sectional train to close one of these locations.
The main border crossing point near Hungary Roszkea was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office for the purpose of handling the metal container for people, and the crowds crawled inside.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
A group of immigrants blocked between the main engines of Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: According to the national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership Bernie Sanders has narrowed side by side of Bernie Sanders.
Former Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, will continue in two-digited chairs in the democratic appointment contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders has been blackmailed by Senator Bernie Sanders.
Clinton now supports 47% of democratic voters (calculated at 58%), and the other Sanders is supported by 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he is going to join the presidential race, but he is in favour of 15% of democratic voters.
Over five months before the beginning of the pre-elections, the majority of democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand more closely behind their own choice than other candidates' supporters.
Clinton's popularity has decreased among several population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, while Sanders has increased somewhat.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership is narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's forward journey within the 50-year-old democratic leaders has disappeared, and now he's on level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads to older voters.
In the last month, Clinton led the Sanders into a double-digit series of liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five percentage points.
About half of the democratic voters in the country say that they are keen to support Clinton if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth states that he will support him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six per cent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that the existing Clinton supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confused with those who at the moment are not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter of them would be eager to support him.
When 48% of democratic voters say that they would be eager to support Clinton, the first Republican member of Donald Trump, the same is said of the less frequent Republican voter (35%).
When they were asked on an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16 %) and then the most popular answers were that it was now the right time for the female president (13 %) and that he was the best candidate for the job (10 %).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 %).
The same opinions as well as the possibility of being selected were also mentioned.
Since the Vice-President has an impact on the possible presidential candidate, 57 per cent of democratic voters would like to see him already in the race - although a third disagrees.
When asking the Democrats who they would choose to appoint second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that they would choose a Biden, which is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the democratic candidate, the head of Hilary Clinton will grow from Sanders. If Biden's source comes in, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves out, the figure will be 30.
55 per cent of democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent in the last month.
With this figure, Biden remains far away, but the share of those who consider him to be the voter has grown.
However, when they asked the democratic voters what was most important for the candidate, they raised their views in favour of voting.
In the last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered to be impossible candidates for these voters either.
With regard to certain key issues, democratic candidates or potential candidates are doing well among the voters of their party on certain key issues.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden best handles the triple with honesty, whereas Clinton's strength is leadership.
30% of democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say they don't have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in an ideological agreement.
When you look at all these issues, about a quarter of the democratic voters say that they have no opinion of Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server as Foreign Minister still raises questions, the majority of democratic voters are pleased with his explanation and say that the matter did not affect their general opinion about him.
However, it is different when we consider America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third is satisfied.
The opinion of the public was distributed in March shortly after the matter came into light.
Most Americans say that the e-mail policy did not affect their overall opinion on Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all registered voters. Only 32% consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has calculated 8 percentage points from last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton does not think it fair and reliable.
At the same time, 55 per cent of all registered voters throughout the country do not consider Trump to be honest and reliable either.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates involved in the investigation, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many do not have an opinion, just like Carson does.
The error margin in the investigation involving 351 democratics is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Trump in a national survey in Donald Trump.
Ben Carson is coming to Donald Trump near the latest CBS News/New York Times survey.
Two candidates collected half of all votes in the new survey leaving others fighting for pedestrians.
Republican voters throughout the country are still strongly in favour of the Trump, whose support has risen from the previous survey of the CBS 23 per cent of the 27 per cent questionnaire published on Tuesday, prior to last month's Fox News election survey, published on Tuesday.
However, Carson, at the same time, rose from six percent to 23%.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well with different demographic groups and is replacing Trump's higher education among the Republican voters.
The rest of the field has been left behind, with the exception of Cary Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasichi. Wisconsin's support for Governor Scott Walker has fallen most: from 10% in the last month to 2% in the present month.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are at levels of 6% in third place.
The error margin in the 376 Republican voters' sample of this latest questionnaire in September is +/- 6 per cent.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson in rising surveys: he has 19 per cent support for Republicans, and Trump is 32 per cent his previous 32 per cent.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was also significantly above Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgery for nothing, although Carso apologized for the question of Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday he had a campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the fr five brothers are charged with the death of a first year student from Baruch College's first year student from Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died in a fraternity ceremony in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains region, the murder charge has been brought against five people.
The members of the Baruch College University in New York University Pi Delta Psi were brutally assaulted by Chun "Michael" Deng during the membership trial in September 2013 and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with sand, and then he repeatedly tatted to the ground when he tried to walk through the ice field towards the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that he would get hurt in his head, and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the team didn't call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but the charges say they waited an hour until they brought him to the hospital, the police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, look for information on his symptoms online, and contact the Brotherhood National President Andy Mengi, asking for advice here, Chief of Police Chris Wagner told me at the press conference.
"At this point, members began hiding their ritual equipment, and so in practice set the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's", Commissioner Wagner said.
Deng couldn't get a job, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng received repeated attacks on the head, body and travel of a boring object.
"There have been too many families who have suffered from brotherhood preference, when at least one student per year has died as a result of it ever since 1970", Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, said in his opinion.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is an important step.
The great jury of the Monro County, in favour of the first five members being charged with the murder of a third degree of murder.
32 other members of the fraternity, including Meng, will also be accused of violent simplification and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to gain responsibility only for individuals. If there is an organisation behind what has happened that has been approved either officially or informally, they will also be given responsibility", Wagner stated on Tuesday at a press conference.
Baruch College denied the fraternity and the national brotherhood to have their contact with the local branch.
This happens when the U.S. central bank increases interest rate rates.
The rise in interest rates and the market in rising rates is falling, the yields of bonds are rising, and the economy is falling.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take or how long it's gonna take.
The past does not provide much help in the timing of the economy, as is the case specifically with the economy.
Since the first rise, the recovery has taken only 11 months; sometimes it has been as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the central bank in raising interest rates has often been, although not always, a factor in determining how economic and financial assets react.
Therefore, central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on it because interest rates start to rise, but mainly on the time cycle of normalisation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the theory.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the underlying hurdles of interest have been overrated.
"The first increase following the global economic crisis has inevitably been interpreted in some areas to end the 'sufficient money' era," said Julian Jessop, chief economic expert on global economic affairs in Capital Economics, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect a gradual return to normal, although still low, the level is such a revolutionary shock that many people seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effect.
It is an overview of how some aspects of the economy will react on the basis of past developments:
As has been seen on the market in the last few months, waiting for the rise in the interest rate may make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a reality, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study about what happened after the central bank’s increase.
On the contrary, over the last 35 years, the market is usually strong, about 14 per cent increase when approaching the increase, 250 days after the situation is relatively flat (mean increase 2.6 per cent), and the normal value has been reached after 500 days in the six last cycle of 14,4 per cent, reported in the recent analysis of the leading capital strategy for the Nuveen Asset Management company Bob Doll, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle, when the yields start to fall.
The recessions are part of the economy, but interest payments often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been met before, and which can speed up the recession.
This is especially the GDP, which will be the closest to its lowest level of all time before the central bank's interest rate is applied.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 increase in nominal annual GDP after 1950 has only been less than 4.5 per cent twice.
While in the second quarter of 2015, 3.6 per cent, rarely believes it will remain when the third quarter has advanced by 1.5 per cent, says Atlantan Federal Reserve Bank.
The rise in interest rates in this fragile economic regulation may be risky and raise the question of whether "this time is different", Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants are prepared to increase the central bank throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the future trade forecasts a probability of only 25%.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all the rise cycles have so far appeared to increase the leverage effect of the supersykls, where GDP has passed its pre-develop peak very quickly since the recovery has begun", the report reports.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptional slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of observation.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been looking forward overwhelmingly to the end of the last recession: the record has been for 35 months, and it is now in progress for 74 months.
The return on return has also been unstable while the market is waiting for interest rates, and the model reminds some of the findings made on capital.
The main point is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will be reflected more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The direction of return on bonds appears to change immediately with regard to the initial increase/action of the cycle.
At the end of the recovery cycle, the return on bonds will be reduced immediately", deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that the interest rate increase will result in the convergence of return on long-term and short-term bond yields, thereby counterbalance the rate of return.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, although "we are still careful about finding income", Schwab noted in an analysis by analyst Kathy Jones.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s instructions for orientation.
"In addition to the slowdown in debt and inflation expectations, there are several indications that the markets have adapted to a more stringent outlook for monetary policy," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the rate of return is even higher, the credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its orientation.
In general, companies whose business mainly invests in the United States win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with a lot of debt are less committed when the increase in the value of a dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have with funding.
"Histor shows that 'quality' shares in general are more profitable after the first three months of interest", Goldman Sachs analysts said in their customer report.
On average, companies with strong turnover passed the low turnover companies after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases by five percentage points on average.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility shares performed better than low quality companies. The first mentioned average was 4 (units) and the second 3 (units).
The debt will become a major problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable interest rates are losing most, Goldman said.
Even consumers outside the trading process have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of a dollar.
Savings can also gain profits with higher returns, even though experts disagree with how quickly the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says.
A conservative representative, Andrew Bingham, is accusing the channel of "national idea".
He claims that it would become increasingly more and more difficult to separate it from a commercial competitor becoming becoming increasingly more and more difficult to make it becoming becoming increasingly more and more more difficult to make becoming increasingly more and more more difficult to make the more and more
He also also took his target at BBC Music Awards Awards Awards, saying that they simply imitate the British Awards Awards Awards Awards Awards.
The Voice The Voice The Voice, saying that it's not original, either. It's not original, either.
BBC Radio 3 is becoming a classic FM, claims to be the leading congressman, adding pressure to the production company, to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
A conservative representative, Andrew Bingham, also said to the heads of the BBC that the public service radio also seemed to be "governizing" its content, and that it is increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "national sense" - is turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took his aim at the BBC Music Awards Award Gala, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards that started last year seems to be just a different name from the British Awards Gala organized under the different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples I've actually remembered when, in fact, you just copied something you already found on the market", Bingham said.
The president of BBC denied the accusations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much above its commercial competitors as regards live music and information to the public.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is, in fact, a priority.
"In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Earlier this year, chief of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel must work more than before to reach the public because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC offer, which was criticised for entering the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
From the Dutch production company Talpa Media estimates that 22 million pounds of music were purchased by the Democratic People's Republic of China from the People's Republic of China.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not inherent in any of its own?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, where Paloma Faith and Boy George function as stars, is produced in "an early BBC style".
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success inside his own house" the next time he started the entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent the production of future The Voice periods, or to impose on the authorising officer's money to be used for other forms of entertainment.
The net sales for the moment rose to a minimum in August, Black Friday may be the reason for this.
The net net sales increased by 7 per per per per cent during the first three months of 2015 by 7 per per per cent during the first three months of the first three months month in the first three months of 2015.
In the last month there was a rise at the lowest since the start of statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales were strengthened by the use of mobile devices to buy.
Experts believe that November Black Friday may control consumption.
Virtual shopping has grown enormously for more than a decade and has turned many of the British shopping shops into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there is now evidence of a level playing field in the air, as the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2015.
Total housing consumption grew at least since the start of statistics in 2000: only 5 per cent increase from the previous year.
Experts say that there are indications in the air that there is a levelling of online sales when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would improve over time", Andy Mulcahy, the supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago the online sales strengthened when buyers began using their mobile phones for shopping.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as on a couch.
But now it's up and down (growth) can count.
Since America, the Black Friday phenomenon has been considered one of the reasons behind slowing down shops.
Experts believe that consumers will be controlled by the purchase process before the last Friday of November.
Last year averaged five times more buyers pave their computers to pick up shops, pouring out many traders' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got buyers to argue about the findings, can slow down shopping.
In a study published by British Retail Consortium, it was found that only about one in five of the five were used online.
For certain products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using shop-sold fashion chains.
The Muslims bury the deaths of Meka's uprisings in an accident, the consequences for Bin Laden's family, the consequences for Bin Laden's family.
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Meka, during Mecca, during the first funeral.
Saudi Arabia has partly been accused of the collapse of the building waste, Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health told me that a total of 394 people were also injured when the lifting rate fell down.
29 dead were decked in the air across the streets, while hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them. The victims died when the upsurgents collapsed in Mekka's great-mokebox.
Mostly white-dressed currants filled the route to respect the first dead who made their last trip to the land of Al-Moaissem's cemetery.
A sad course passed through the sacred place where only a few days ago, the crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and poured out the worshipers.
The bodies were released to be buried when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden's family building group as a responsible disaster, including 394 people who were injured.
The killing of the uprisings in the Meka’s great-power against worshipers of the worshipers, 29 bodies were worn across the streets through the streets.
Among the dead were the father of four children from Qasim Akram Bolton, Manchester, and he was at his first sanctuary when the uprising race collapsed.
Akram had been in a major power plant with his parents before the start of the annual hair-shit-here arrangement.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the bow to Mekka will continue when thousands continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binlad Group should not have left the crane guard up when it was not in use.
The decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency in the Arabic version said that the Binlad Group is partly responsible for the collapse.
The English - language service of the news office did not mention this detail, but it said that the company's directors are not allowed to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore that he would find out what led to the fall of the cranes in the yard of the great ostrich, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered before later this month's hair-stamping session held this month.
Binlad Group has not published notices of a serious collapse, and its representatives have not been informed to comment.
The Royal Decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorologists.
There are tens of uprisings around the Mekka’s major power station, which are part of a huge building line led by the Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to the reigning family of Saudi Arabia for decades, leading to large construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the late leader of Al-Qaida, was a rebel son whose family denied in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in wind and rain weather only days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for the sanctification that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities are telling us that 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rivals (174,000 pounds) to be paid to the families of the dead and to the permanent injured persons.
The other injured persons will receive half of this sum.
B&Q-popopo B says that Eastern European workers working cheaply in Eastern Europe are behind the edge of favor.
The British increasingly use more and more assistant services, says Veronique Laury, says Veronique Laury.
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise in the number of professionals that come from eastern Europe.
As a result of the opening of 200 more Srewfix stores for professional professionals, 200 more will be added.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q-sales around the country.
Author Rupert Steiner, the principal writer of the city for the Daily Mail magazine.
Britts are said to give up their hammers and their goals and to hire skilled Eastern European workers to do their homework.
It seems that if you're a leftover with a hammer or you're painting walls, you're in a minority right now.
The British sees that more and more assistants will be hired to deal with tea-se-seven jobs in their homes, says B&Q's boss behind the company's back.
The new Director-General Veronique Laury, who owns the home-retail chain, said that there was the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and that they were offering their services at the price of ridicule.
This will result in Kingfisher planning to open up 200 new trades for workers in Screenfix and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said that she wants more women to work at B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchase decisions made in the store are precisely the most beautiful sex she's ever done.
Today, the majority of staff are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: today there is more than one woman's economy, where domestic sales are made more than before.
Laury said, "Most of our shop staff are still men.
We need to seek a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women have a major role to play in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the only five women who lead the most important companies in the British FSE100 index, and he has built up his board of directors in such a way that it has as many male and female men.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in whose group is equal to 50% of women, including its Director General and Managing Director.
Laury said, "This was an informed decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It hasn't been hard to find good women in the board."
Kingfisher announced the bill in both half-year's income and sales after the group took up the costs of closing down shops.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screenfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new movements.
The three-year-old government decided to rely on a mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were achieved pretty quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees' centres began to force the country to stand on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
In time, many people think that there will also be a sense of reason.
Let's see if it's okay to stop when it's bad anyways.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to report that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but that they are going to work.
This would have been impossible in an old consensus period.
Of course, there was nothing online where to protest, but in an open sense the declaration of an act of corruption would have been a small political suicide of man.
Millions of trade unions are protested by a few tens of thousands of people, but it gives a reason for thinking.
The status of trade union movements is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the objectives of the movement in their own ownership, values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement's activities, government's rough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have looked like they've been on their own for years, it's finally time for the parties to reach the issue, that is, workers' rights to defend, appear, and properly.
Thus, the government may be able to seize the role of ay movement when membership in trade union may be seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever happens to the activities of the organisations, it is a horrendous fact that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped long ago.
For example, industrial output has been down by 31 months in the successive period.
GDP continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
These things should make everyone think they are.
Hard savings for the University of Lapland: To reach 8.5 million savings, the staff are reduced by 130 with 130 employees.
The University of Lappeenranta will start a savings account with the aim of obtaining a total of EUR 8,5 million of cut-off costs.
As part of savings, the University will start all staff negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 employees.
The aim of the other activities is also to save two million.
In the context of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is the budget, which expects the actual operation to be a deficit of 8.5 million.
It also affects the government’s financial operations.
During the financial year, the university will deliver about 2.6 million net deficits.
The expenditure will increase slightly for the next year, but the financing from the same Ministry will be reduced by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10 % of the total budget.
The interaction between massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction of corporate financing with our university is very important, says President Anneli Pauli in the communication from the University of Pauli.
Before summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in the financial envelope now appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will take six weeks in law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways.
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in entering Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is intended to gradually open up to competition.
The first place is the local traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
There is a distance between the distance and the distance after the passing of the journey.
Souter is telling us that he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
Yle says that onnibus plans will be welcomed.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has been informed about other international companies' interest in rail transport, which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
The central central central central central central central central central central central central central central central central bank must take decisions on interest rates at interest rate levels.
The rest of the world will follow from the page when the U.S. Central Bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
When Reuters made the questionnaire to 80 economic scientists, some more than half of those who still last week believed that the central bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0 to 0,25 %.
This is a historical event, for the time when the central bank cut interest rates to zero is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central central central bank has the opportunity to get away from zero levels and to start normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics, senior upwards of the International Economics Institute.
The U.S. economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought billions of dollars in balance sheets and has created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to rise, but the signs show that they also believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. (CET)
Delta State University shooter left an apology message.
After shooting at his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before he shot his colleagues later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "shits" about his first murder and hoped that he could cancel it", the authorities said on Tuesday.
In the morning, about 10 a.m., about 10 a morning, the 911 number was received.
On Monday, he told me that he's been shooting and killing someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said, "he killed his wife last night", and he also mentioned that there was a "similar dog" in the house, which "is not bothering anyone", but it is probably shocking.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me it.
Lamb did not give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police arrived, there was a body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message written by 45-year-old Lamb saying, "I'm so sorry I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing a message Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt before he finally killed himself late on Monday at the police station when he was surrounded by him.
Professor William LaForge of the University said that he knew there was no contradiction between Lamb and Schmidt, but that " clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
The authorities said on Tuesday that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb would have believed that Prentis was in relation to Schmidt, there was no "law no information or evidence" for any "three times" of any kind.
Shawn O'Steen said he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "good man."
A couple divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, who is "a disoriented."
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his daughter were "perfect best friends."
According to Newsday Knowles, Prentiss worked at his home manually online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss's.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
The police said Lamb had called his relatives somewhere about Monday night to tell them that "You're not going to jail."
When the police reached Lamb's highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb stopped his car by the side of the road, left it there and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued that in the spring of 2015, Delta State was a member of the University’s website, reports the list of CVs that were found on the University’s website.
The stars that lost their charm power are the stars that lost their charm power.
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he was ill with leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
Word is that he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
This is indeed the case with regard to tax.
Manchester Unitedin Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double fracture due to a double fracture.
Luke Shaw had a double fracture on his right foot when Manchester United destroyed PSV Eindhoven won the Masters' league match.
Although the defender stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would be able to play for another time this season.
The damage caused by Héctor Moreon's reckless shielding was caused by the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had crashed into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes in the field and had to be given oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture in his leg, and now he's in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe the day after that, and then we'll cut him in Manchester.
This is terrible. a boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18, suffers from difficulties and then plays great, and now it's happening.
When I was in the dressing room, he had a oxygen mask on top of him.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the middle phase.
I hope he can play the game this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card or a red card and a punishment trigger.
The ex-wivesman Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian operator be mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged jacket.
Shaw twiittasi reads, "Thank you all for your messages, words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery is beginning now, I'm coming back stronger."
Subject: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw's case and loses the PSV to the PSV.
The British defender has an additional incentive to recover from the next June European Championships in France.
Coach Phillip Cocu of the PSV said, "It's a really bad injury."
If any player gets out for this kind of injury, everything is very sad.
The purpose of our players is never to offend the opponent.
Moreon's leg was broken when he played in a Mexican team against Van Galal's Netherlands in the 2014 MM tournament.
"Moreno takes this hard because it's not intended to hurt an opponent, and when you hear that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see you in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke's jacket.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after he was challenged by Chris Modeling.
Will Kai David Cameron know Lorax better than this?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won’t take long before he almost learns from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the service providing the children’s care for holiday was asked by the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s book, he chose Dr Seuss’s The Lorax book, the environmental protection story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes on the SuperCamps website of the SuperCamps website in a message and goes on to: "The fun, moving, creative, and contains a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have never seen before."
This is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the draft book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to fill the original text for quite a short time.
"In the rich city where all nature has disappeared and even the air is a commodity, Ted hopes to win his dreams over the girl's heart by filling in Audrey's desire to see the true tree", the text says and describes the love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write by Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it was taken from the plan sum of the Lorax film found on the Internet Movie Database website, starting with the following: "In the rich city within the library, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, the Ted boy hopes to win his dreams on the side of the heart of her Miss Audrey."
Considering that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so uncanny to have a book run. There's a young, anonymous boy who hears how the local nature has destroyed the greedy, wood-colding and the need for a fiber-cooking Kerskanen, without giving the story a name about the short, coldness of Lorax, which "fears for trees".
Such a relatively invisible PR task is probably outside for an assistant who has apparently never read the book 20 times for a consecutive child.
The Prime Minister's editor said that the text must have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff but did not comment at the moment.
Clearly, Adam Lyth was in danger of being side of the English team, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for tour, I do not believe that the repetition of the last 3-0 serial destruction is likely to happen.
I wouldn't even shut down the guest gain from the bills.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it is accompanied by good bikers and the team’s thinking is strong: they do not have scars from 2012, only young positives.
Moeen Ali develops in its threading and Adil Rashid is an attack option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped out of the English Cress team, he was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is obviously difficult to analyse for me because I'm his chief coach in York.
His seven games have been good to the attackers in challenging circumstances, and it is simple but the bear truth is that the critics are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the announcement, because, as I have said before, players are the best factors for choice.
About 100 points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he himself was responsible for his own fate.
I hope he gets more runnin' for Yorkshire, another chance comes up.
Mr. Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not do as well as it could have been, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is above all a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the hitter will be able to get a copy of the trail.
Lyth was elected seven times to the country team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was chosen nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and in guests.
The only subject of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first to the Caribbean when Lyth was in a state of excellence, but it was now lost in the past.
Alex Hales is coming along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
There's something in him that we saw early this season when he made 236 points against us in Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as anyone before him, but this, of course, depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in a hit-and-run has been rolled up on the side of Cook, where an extra feeder could be brought to the field, but we could have held four quicks, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why the hitter could hit there, and this left-handed man has already shown himself to be quite a Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job in the province of Worcestershire, but he is a third for them and there is little difference in it.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games at the fall of the first pull before he moved to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a thief, and the little I've been dealing with with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his non-depreciated statistics - hitting the average of 31, with the ball 35 - and thinking that it's a gambling game, but there are no too many players at the table, and the electrs chose young people.
He'll learn a lot about this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few hard increases for the coach.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter M.K.A. Jayawardenen as a consultant in games can prove to be a genius.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience because he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes into the game of the white ball and brings with him energy as well as an unforgivable sham.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international crises, whether it was playing or coaching, and he's got the same kind of exploitable fool as the Mirc.
Sometimes the new voices in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team manager from Durham, Ben Stokes, rested in one-day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, the coachers and the electrs do not make timetables.
And it must be remembered that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be taken on light grounds.
Britain's departures from the EU (Brexit) will be able to win if the economy is in difficulties in 2017
The half-life renegotiation strategies for the holding of the United Kingdom in the EU are facing an increasing number of problems, even though they do not even take into account the heartfelt Jeremy 's "Is it yes or not?"
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragsa.
The European diplomatic cooperation has recently explained that, since the EU is so far in a number of crises that are not all its own faults, some Member States have become tired of the British independent agenda, which is full of concessions and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not want in most respects.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Trade Union Organisation decided that it would not want to do so either if they were to undermine social protection.
Maybe we could call it Dave and George's selfiegenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance are delayed by summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, whether with or without a local eyewash, and then coming home, saying that they will win supporters for the reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outwards inside the British EU tent, "Don't leave us alone with France", says Berlin, he suggests that the shortest ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care about us then we'll leave.
German careful and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave his job before it is ruined in the same way as it took too long for the late Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France France France France Netherlands is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a evacuating force too.
Poland may now have a nationalist rule of justice, Spain has a left-wing left-winger.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificed for self-ibrites, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it because of similar separatist trends.
So, my friend presents, some such ministers can even consciously plan to make useless comments to the Scottish National Party style during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexit process.
"The renegotiation had been held" and "The renegotiation had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have had the bitter experience of being a part of the greedy Fleet Street newspaper and how the EU-sceptic press alone are what they were not inspired by Tony Bern at the time of the 1975 referendum, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by the ratio of 2 to 1 in the 21st century.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who made a name for themselves by writing "the EU's direct bananas" as a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s.
He may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of strangers who were visiting taxes, phones hacking foreigners and people who were registered elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Blair actually thought exactly the same about them, but realized that if you're in a cage with a lustful gorilla, bananas will have to be given up for a blur if you don't want to be at that gorilla's lunch dinner and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Bulgarian than Blair himself, when it came against Cameron's renegotiation, because Bair had accepted the principle of the EU's abandoned constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair access to the situation in which he was released.
The press never forgiven him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby, who killed me kindly at the Westminster Parliament on Monday (I told him that he has no longer had time to waste me), seems to be in danger of re-enacting Neil Kinnock's 80s boxing in Murdochia's strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take some time, however, he has to develop a coherent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not with me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, which Corby, from BBC, left on Sunday.
The official status of Corbyn in Europe is, beautifully speaking, evolving.
He says that he would like us to stay in a renewed Europe.
Well, most of the people outside Ukip’s war-war ideals and the most charming nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said this way both on radio and on TV this week, when his internal patrol officer would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint a kask John McDonald shadow government minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his father was embezzling on TV, trying to be unfair to his colleagues of the Labour Party without, however, going so far as to lose his place of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the fight to keep in mind "where there is any situation" - benn's statement - was not what McDonald said, and not because of what Corby told the Heads and referees at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever it is, Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched on me), the discipline of communication is important for the time period of the circular TV, and in particular for social media wheels, which are acceptable to a growing platform for persecution and fraud.
As McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to consider the support of the Labour Party in the referendum as obvious.
That's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But the basic debate between McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and, in line with their Benn-spiritual regulated economy and their anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult conversation with left-wing thinkers who are essential to the dogma in the mutilation of small differences.
As far as his duality is concerned with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby does not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats just have to try to explain it to his superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin be worth wasting political capital (including they have suspicious voters) on British concessions when it can be completely in vain?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed at the weak military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the case of a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded on Monday at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the Public Health England's electronic tobacco assessment by public experts.
Researchers have said that the claim by the State-funded agency that electric tobaccos are 95% less harmful than traditional ones was the result of a meeting of 12 people, some of which had contacts with the tobacco industry.
Experts who wrote the British Medical Journal (BMJ) agreed with Lancet's criticisms of the Public Health England (PHE) evidence in his report on electrical tobacco.
In the last month, PHE published this "virstancylüs" report, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
In the last month, the medical journal Lancet published a draft which attacked the "exemptive hutera base" of the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers, written in BMJ, have wondered whether the claims "were built on a rock or sand".
European Professor Martin McKee and Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, Simon Capewell, at the University of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, say: "The main principle of public health is that the methods of action must be established for proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects the PHE's argument that "the current best estimate is that electrical tobaccos are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it will be one of the 12 people who developed a multi-criteria analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on disadvantages combined with products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was the company called EuroSwiss Health, which the Director-General said had previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One meeting of 12 people announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not from the funding that he was told had previously received from Philip Morris International, they would increase their funding.
The selection criteria for the panel members are not reported, but the panel includes a number of well-known producers of electricity, some of which also report on the area of funding that they have received in the investigation.
Others have not been known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco director.
The study produced by the group "publishably admit" that there is a lack of "inconclusive evidence of damage to most of the products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say that the PHE claims that "there is no evidence that the electric tobacco works as a route for smoking children or non-smokers" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of PHE's health and well-being, says that the arguments put forward in BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Economics are significantly less harmful than burning."
Half of those who burn their lives die from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by the electricity product are relatively small, but we must continue to examine the long-term impact.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public uncertainty about tobacco compared to relative risks.
Almost 80 000 people die of smoking-related illness each year, and smoking costs NHS 2 billion pounds a year.
By explaining the current evidence, which is, even though the electrical pulp is not risk-free, their disadvantages are only part of a fraction of the sharks of traditional tobacco, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director-General.
Former Channel 4 president, Luke Johnson, said that BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "can give anything" from prices such as, for example, the soap series located on this Albert Square street.
Johnson said that the licence fees should be used only for the purpose of carrying out programmes that are not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticises the BBC that it will put in public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller audience, difficult transmission times for competitors' most viewed programmes and channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said that he had served Channel 4 at the time for six years to establish a relationship with BBC, in vain, for six years.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC is producing and sending programs that would be clearly compatible with unsubsidised competitors", Johnson said to the Upper Room Communication Committee as part of its research into the future of BBC's research into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained, and I am not sure that it would be a good idea for this media or in the long term, it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not do and produce.
The Voice will be sent to the most important delivery time, because the desire for the future will be to gather as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would look like a program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's clearly nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not understand why the aggressive tax should finance programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one of those, and EastEnders is another, no doubt inside the house is executed.
To be honest with you, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand what it's about about sending a public service service.
I don't think it'll weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4 in 2004-2010 serial entrepreneur Johnson said that BBC is responsible for hunting viewers "for the goals of people working with them, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the most popular series of BBC's comments, recalling Tony Ball's previous Director of Sky's comments. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sell such series as EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC's smaller public public public service programmes "are going to BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but BBC thus fulfils its responsibility and can then 4 billion pounds of licence fees while defending the yields of the licenses from 4 billion pounds, and it is only hypocritical to say that 'that we are doing all these unknown programs that no one looks'".
They'll put them on a destination where no one will ever come to see them.
Regarding the authorisation fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I want you to look for a more aggressive system in the case of who receives the most value for it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year gets a lot of value, but I don't know if it's true for people who have a big money for 150 pounds, because they don't use BBC much.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also witnessed to the Committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should review its current mission of Reith 'information, education and entertainment'.
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as training - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of the radio and that it should take a model of Australia and Canada's broadcasts and transform the task into a 'information, education and entertainment' format.
As far as partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he considers to be only one on TV, and to join commercial companies in such a way that all of them can be seen online.
The use of sound waves allows the control of the brain cells by means of the "phone genetics".
The video shows how shuttle birds change directions as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them by sound waves.
Small-scale wholesalers change directions as soon as they hit a sound pulse that is too high to be heard by human ears.
The pulses work by switching on geneticly modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic membranes that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light.
The researchers said that the worms show the function of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Researcher Sreekanth Chalasani, at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Sreekanth Chalasani, told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-brain stimulating. It is an invasive measure in which people have electrical pulses to control Parkinson’s disease.
The shells do not normally react to the ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with a microscopic small bubble, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles strengthened the ultrasonic waves, which then passed into the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4-ion channels, structures that are contained in the cell membranes of some worms.
Audio waves make these ion channels open up and activate the attached cells, reports the report published in the Nature Communications Journal.
To prepare ultrasonic controlled shuttle land, Chalasan modified worms genetically so that part of their business nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used the ultrasound for modified mats, the microcrumbs strengthened the sound waves and cared for the worms where they switched on the modified business nerve cells.
There are some similar features to those of optogenetics, a working tool that allows scientists to connect nerve cells on top and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Unlike the light that needs to send an optical to the desired location within the brain, low-residuous ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue in an occult way, so they can be sent to the brain from the skull.
"We believe that using the gene therapy and the therapeutic virus may be possible to obtain the target human nerve cells immediately respond to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in a clinical environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertising is a disgrace to Britain's arms trade.
Look at the video against Amnessy International's weapons.
Fascinating killing machines.
Folding leg irons.
Frightening bombs.
And electronic bending sticks that cause painful pain but do not leave any trace behind.
The happy voice and the comics text will leave no doubt that this advertising of the world’s largest positions is a sharp parade produced by Amnessy International in order to highlight the willingness of the British Government to trade weapons for repression governments at the ExCeL Centre in London's shipyard district of London for a long-term celebration of the Defence and Security Equipment International ExCeL Centre.
Subject: DSEI Stations: authorial governments arrive in London, London.
With a separate campaign, also, bus stops and metrojune appeared many posters that require more accurate familiarisation.
"Quality of information, Traveling on the DLR route 15-18 September?" one is asked using London's underground font and brand, as the line of the DLR turns into a picture of the tank.
This September, the pack of gun dealers arriving on the DLR route... customers are being asked to help stop the weapons fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists who had their work in the Museum of Cruel Designs Museum of Banks Disney (in the museum of public plans).
A collective named Special Prrol Group helped to spread posters around London using the Ad Space Hack Packs. It is a six-six-six-pack of six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-six-of-six-six-six-six-six-six-of-six-of-six-six-six-six-six-of-six-seven.
Transport for London is not interested in this unauthorised 'pubic vandalism'.
One of the parodia commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator of the Cruel Designs and the journalist of the University of Essex, artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political work to non-diversial audiences.
A lot of artists have begun working with activists in opposition fronts when they have realized that they must go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.

Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook over the last 24 hours more than 100,000 times. It created a free advertising firm VCCP, as well as a graphic designer and background director working for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that no replacement fairs were advertised at all - and also the ExCeL calendar had an empty spot at that time - and thought, "Give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic, darker corporate advertising, but "it was more stopable to stress the matter with bright colors and animation".
"They've done fantastic work helping us to raise questions about the illegal torture device sold at fairs," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
Now the United Kingdom Government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally sold near our home.
Perhaps in connection with the most creative art installation, ExCeL comes from inside when the screensmen shop fantasticly decorated products.

Eight golden rules for living in student housing.
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student home when I was an unknown 19 year old, and then I believed in the Barettes and moral relativism, but only now I remember the violent smiles and the numerous, long complaints that I've made.
The majority of what I have learned can be summed up into eight simple rules.
Moving into an apartment can be anything that comes from the nerves to absolutely scary.
It's nice to say where you're from, did you like the middle of the year and where you think about Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite, because really, it's just because I don't really have a chance to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to withdraw the spirit - ask questions and show an interest in the matter.
It will guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, and not those you would like to talk to even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'll share the switches.
Give people room.
People's rooms are often turned into cocktail dances, flats, and very common timeliness, but they are also places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Subject: Don't even imagine starting a university when you're in a relationship with a partner.
University is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments consist of a culture of walking from room to room, which is friendly, social and creates lifelong friendship.
It could mean hell to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say "I love you and I want to be friends with you, but you need to leave now that I can collect back the energy I spent talking with you".
Try to understand when a student friend is tired of socializing and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
You know, knocking when you came up with a speech: knock.
A guy in my student residence thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some stuff.
By making friends with bread.
As you start the university in the peak season of the bakery, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate-breadboard and presenting yourself to some extent less strange, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" -50s.
Offering self-made sweets is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk, and they may be joining you in the future with a delicious surprise for your face.
Of course, this depends, you know how to bake.
Badly mixed with flour-sugar-sugar fats are likely to get people to just pretend to sleep when you're knocking.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
I understand that taking someone chicken is stealing, but what if you just take milk for tea?
Ask him and check the milk owner.
It is possible that they will give you permission, even though they are climbing internally.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to take it as an adult than my roommate who mixed up his milk with detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise so people don't get to sleep or study.
It's just that you're not a decent person, but because you're like that proverb's dam soaking boiler.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbor if they could play the drum and bass music to the bottom of her voice because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume of votes.
Finally, when they silenced at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly allowed them to sleep two hours before putting their own music on the brink, locked their doors and left in a three-hour driveway.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to change with you in the same apartment with you?
Or, in turn, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought that a roommate would be your future mate, you'd be struck together, you'd break up, and then you'd see him every day and possibly lose all your friends together to him.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if a hot roommate is not really your future spouse, you could even try to talk to reason on your lower end.
At that exhilarating moment, when you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the border between playing and bullying is thinner than it seems.
I know it's funny, but it's possible to cancel in a moment.
You can give us the safety of useful and fun teaching by hiding something, but never mess up a room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock their doors and tap the keys to the water glass, which you then put in the freezer, but don't attach their property to the pendant ceiling like twice as many times as possible.
Ra racist attack at foreign students’ residence in Kitela, Kitela - The house that was designed for the reception center was hit in Salo Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo.
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made on Kite in northern Karelia.
Unlike the police before, it is not accommodation for minors asylum seekers, but for foreign students who have been living in Finland for a longer time, says Heidi Lukkainen, the teacher of the State College of Kiteen Evankelinen, says.
The windows and walls of the Parliament's accommodation facilities were jolted with racist characters, such as hats, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation spaces, reports Eastern Finland's police.
According to Lukkainen, the responsibility teacher of youth guarantee education at the University of Nations, the building was estimated at ten people at the time of the attack when the violence was committed.
"It's been a weekend and adult people who are free to move, and some may have been elsewhere," says Lukkainen.
There are people from 12 different nationalities who have been housed at the National College.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time as well as minors who have just arrived.
All those in the mixed building have a status status.
She is a student at adult school, she is a part of vocational studies and she is a Finnish student", says Lukkainen.
A status is so-called a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years in Finland for a foreign resident who has already been present for some time.
The Eastern Finnish police are investigating the attack as a damage and a violation of home peace.
According to a large number of people, students were held at a press conference on Monday, where there were also the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had 20 years of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," says Lukkainen.
According to a lot of people, the mess has been cleaned out of the walls by now.
The authors suspected that there had been at least three men and they had been on the move by a light passenger car.
I think this is the end of a youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," says Lukkainen.
There has also been a hacked hospital in Salo, which has been designed for reception centre.
The incident happened last week.
The matter was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
On the wall of the hospital, a hacker was drawn and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been made to the police.
Revision 15 September at 16.02 Revised by the police, corrected by incorrect information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state of the Y-train to the Lamb... the passengers are chewing, "the old idiotic"
The Y-train going from Helsinki to Raasepor to Karelia will cease to pass in March.
The news made passengers entering the train start-up at Helsinki main railway station.
In particular, there is a downward trend in the Siuntian population, said Torbjörn Bengtström, the municipality of Torbjörn Bengtström.
It's stupid because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time and the people who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is coming on the tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains on the main track will be combined into a new R-line.
I'm going to break into the station in Lake End and the Nuppunna Tuuskussa are going to be decommissioned.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes the Ministry of Transport to purchase train transport for the following contract term.
The season will change in the course of the year and there will be closed routes throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs later on.
Sir Bengtström considers that the State's train shuttle is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated them in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be regret on top.
Y-trains are also used by others other than Raaseporans and Siunists, because it is fast and will pass over several stations.
In Espoo, Annina Pöyry was harmed by the train to the fate of travelers beyond the urban area.
"It's really bad for those who have to plan their trip again," he said when he was in pain with his Y-train.
A little relief is promised.
It is likely that a new train connection will come to the beach, which will replace Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) region, i.e. to take you to Kirkkonummän.
This increases costs for HSL, in principle, the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
The costs are still impossible to assess carefully.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, the HSL has paid about a million dollars a year from the Y train, the Ministry does much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves between two positions.
On the other hand, the number of train posts in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
The whole country will end up with 28 small positions and numerous routes.
The Ministry will no longer buy train services from the routes of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinjoki.
The small mountainous river-skiing route is shortened as a route to the Little Mountain-War.
The train tours are reduced on the routes of Riihinäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, the port of Kovola-Kotka and Kajani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are made in closing shifts, while the total number of trips in transport purchased by the ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book "Marx is good to get to know."
The crisis in the global economy has surfaced Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his conclusion published in 1867-1894 to capital, writing the current state of Marx capital in the book, published today by Yrjö Hakanen, the former President of GDP.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time", Hakanen writes in his introductory words.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and intrusiveness of the capital economy increasingly far-reaching in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly far-reaching.
The list of authors of the book, based on the Capital Seminars, is also published by Professor of Aalto University, a respected financial partner, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx in its current "fort and forever".
However, the former Executive Director of the Industrial Research Institute and the Economic Affairs Committee is not a Marxian, is he?
Oh, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx as a timely economic thinker, but rather as an interesting socialist.
Today social sciences have been isolated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and literary class.
"The public understanding is that the architect tells the wrong opinions of the dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went really bad.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions that were too far-reaching of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
However, Korkman sees value in the radical attitude of Marx.
"The more relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are discussing the interests of Marx as well as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may perhaps give inspiration to those who want to understand a big picture, as a result of technological embellishment into a changing world", Korkman analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful for Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Even so, Korkman feels it's worth getting to know him.
"The '70s Marxia couldn't read", says Korkman.
"Maoes and trots and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx is also able to approach without the ideological and political weights of the years back.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's idea world, like the other classes," says Korkman.
The United Nations requires war criminals to judge in Sri Lanka.
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report charges both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil forces for war crimes.
A civil war in Sri Lanka is expected to have died of at least 100,000 people.
There's no precise data on the number of victims.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, the major armed forces' attack in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report is required.
Sri Lanka's armed forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual assault, which was equally likely to be victims of men like women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed themselves as fighters to force the minors and children to become fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice as foreign judges.
In the Yo test in England, she had to review social media in English.
On Wednesday there was a long foreign language, most of which had English in English.
More than 16,000 experiments tested their skills in England.
The test may have written the material from social media.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether the social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
In contrast, the English - language text of 150-250 may have been shown to the holder of the web page’s advisory service.
The site was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish rest chair in Leelia.
He asked him how to help parents look at things also for young people.
The total number of subjects was four, of which one was to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", estimates the third subject of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school English newspaper Mia Lybeck.
On the third issue was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the entire test of "melko normal".
In English or Swedish, the English test asked questions about texts that, for example, contained adaptations to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday a few large Russians (196 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The letters of the autumn continue on Friday, when the second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish, test will take place.
In the upper secondary schools, the test is conducted normally, i.e. the expression of the wage earners does not affect it.
The Board of Inquists invites students to search in good time for appropriate connections to reach a trial meeting.
An additional period may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
In Oulu, the deal was robbed with a gun threat.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning a store was robbed in Kello's district of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper had dressed up in dark clothes and a face-to-face commando shop.
The man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money from the recipient.
We're investigating this case as a serious robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters from other parts of Helsinki, other parts of the family from elsewhere in Finland.
The demonstration against the government's operating decisions will be blocked by the police at the centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicting the police.
Prerequisite data show that up to tens of thousands of people arrive.
The members of the Associations of SAK, Akava and the JRC will meet at the Railway Director at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of the spirit.
On the other hand, it is up to the police in work not only to carry out alarm missions and other police operations, but also to ensure that the giant air is gone.
The roads leading to the train shall be closed from motor vehicles for the period from 9:30 to 14 p.m. for the period from 9:30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
From Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from Kaisaniemi's traffic circle, from the west from Mannerheim to the west.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it seems that enough is enough.
I'm not going to take a stand for the police's work struggle.
Helsinki is in Kujala's view that there will be a demonstration of confusion about the support sections from elsewhere in Finland.
The police are not going to tell us.
"There's something coming, but we're basically gonna be fine with our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling upon us to avoid private car driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic stop goes from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standby traffic is expected from the beginning of the morning to the beginning of the evening.
With protestors arriving from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki also has a lot of subscription buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be released to the Railway Station.
As a matter of fact, the buses are going to be pretty far away from here.
We'll have to walk for the rest of the trip to the demonstration site," says Kujala.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is also a positive side.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally held at these large gatherings of people, will now be taken care of on a case by case basis.
The protestors have informed the police that Helsinki could become tens of thousands of opposition to government economic policy.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to be smooth.
It's a matter of normal working hours or unemployed people, ordinary citizens.
After all, the Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There are also local demonstrations from around Finland on Fridays.
Friday's spirit is in many ways exceptional - do you remember these varicellas and demonstrations?
The great demonstration organised by trade unions Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Professor Emeritus Martti Siiseinen, of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the ay-business protests.
If you didn't do that, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Siisiinen says.
A well-righted government has hit the fundamentals of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also those places that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that ay-move is really trying to get on their knees.
At the same time, the ay-move also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because, by no means, all employees are not supported by Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division of which the demonstration of the spirit creates among the ones whose ay-business would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed who met across Finland showed their opinion at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If we were looking for a comparison for Friday's demonstration, it could be a big account for the unemployed, but it's from Murrrusstorti, said Siisiinen, which was organised in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Murdors collected 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (central) the government tripped from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the wager organisations had never been as bad as it used to be in the time of Aho's mayor's government.
Now the difference between the government and the ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murstors.
Besides, there is now the most powerful government in Finland ever, says Siisiinen.
In this way, the present government coalition is still interesting that it is so strict right despite the words of the Basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the Yytsksk.
Several thousands of protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Despite the undistributed support of wage earners, it can become the largest in years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
There's a lot of them out there.
Traditionally, the protests of the ay movement in Finland have been quite calm - although the practices have been tightening up in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
The speakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisiinen.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on top of them.
The strike of firemen lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, visible strikes were pilots and pilots.
Remember these sheets and demonstrations?
In the 1970's, metal and electrical housings for the 1970s.
The most important sheets in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power and electrical strike in 1977.
Three-six thousand metal men took part in the strike of a metalman.
The strike was suspended on a proposal from the Board of Appeal for seven weeks from the end of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16 percent raise in wages.
In spring 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power failure all over the country.
History in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met in the Parliamentary House, many of whom were made unemployed, to show their opinion on the work.
In 1998, firefighters stayed three months in 1998.
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999.
In 1994, the police entered into an eggmeal in protests against the EU by farmers in protests against farmers.
“Siberia teaches, the EU stops,” said one of the attacks.
Espalia farmers took out tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also enabled farmers to protest and burn hay-pasts in front of the meeting site.
The nurses ceased to pay for 1983 and 1995.
Nurses stayed for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been resident in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
The act threatened with a strike and a mass arrest of executives in 2007.
The threat of mass destruction finally came to a conclusion.
Doctors have diabetes since 2001.
"The doctors in the strike - escape", belonged to a protest statement by laco-dating doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and gave a lively debate on how the strike could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' wages.
Students moving in 2013
About 5 000 students in favour of march for study support in Helsinki, from Senate to Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central police police police in Central criminal police will identify the backgrounds of a refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee police to the Austrian police police in Austria, the Austrian police police police police in Austria, the Austrian police police police police police in Austria.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help to find out the backgrounds of the refugee herd registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the border of Germany a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the scene of the event in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala, Central Criminal Police Commissioner.
At the end of the strike, the other refugees who were travelling on a truck in Austria were more fatally killed.
All 71 passengers on board at that time apparently died by suffocating.
According to the Public Service on cooperation with the Austrian police, according to the Austrian State, the vehicle belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company conducts, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreigner, some 40-year-old man.
In Austria, there have been two arrests of Iraqiism in the field of human trafficking.
The story of the refugees, a former drug criminal and a dead-sacerererererer, a top-scluererer, five smugglers, five smugglers.
The chief smuggler's king, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary, and a cab driver who himself thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people engage in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, and the editor, Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book The Death Travel Office will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the transport of human beings, present proposals for solutions and present smugglers at different levels of business.
The H.S. introduces five of them.
I'm gonna get my bones off them right away.
Round islands on the eastern coasts of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunish people are heading for summer entertainment.
On its behalf, islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometers away.
For the sake of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers away.
There, in El Attaya village, lives in Emir, in a chain of burning captains and the father of six children.
The single islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
Emir has done that with a blue, ten-meter tree water for hundreds of times.
If a boat's full of feathers, it'll fit 40 people.
Emir makes about EUR 8 000 per trip after spending.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
The customers will arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of tunnels wanted to escape the dissatisfactions.
After that, the situation calmed down until again, following the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland in small groups on the One-Sari island.
Emir will accommodate them into empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if the client stops the money in the middle, it's their problem.
Let's go to the water at midnight, we'll be swept in a lush.
The first night we drive off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and throw up in 20 metres of heights.
At the end of the mission, the human cargo has been broken in half an hour and Emir leaves on his return trip.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients up and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
He tells us in the book that once the police suddenly stopped him, he threw all his passengers across the border and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took customers one by one from the neck and threw them across the street," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come south of Sahara.
According to his countrymen, he has to be sorry about this.
I'm gonna get my bones off them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
A regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Bologna, Serbia.
His cab's not very good, the starter motor is finally running, and anyway, it's seen its best days.
However, most important to Goan's customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Rovacha is a village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the center, men travelling without their families are accommodation in tents, lakes and abandoned cars, what everyone has now managed to find or build.
Other families living in the forest who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for reasons other than reason or for another.
Some may also stay in private dwellings, but it's a public secret.
Out of the woods, Goran will find most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walking distance in difficult lands, often mountain areas and in the dark.
As soon as they arrive in the region of Bologna, at the heart of a large area of human transport, people are tired of death.
The natives of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say the truth once and that's enough," Goran says.
According to him, the Africans are trying to make a move.
Goran doesn't like that.
That's stupid nonsense all the way.
First, the price is agreed, for example, for 300 euros, then they drop to 200 and eventually they offer 150 euros.
Goran stresses himself to be a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he is working at a cheaper cost than others and that he is taking a ride to the Hungarian border for only 50 euros per person.
It's about a quarter of a mile, most of it's nice on the highway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-time price.
Goran deserves about EUR 50 000 per year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it's a really nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcut, and he takes his travels a mile from the border.
Then he points the right direction to his customers and goes away.
At work in the work of loving - kindness.
A 35-year-old congolist is called the Confederate, and it's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, where many believers who have fled from Congo, as well as a small center to help children refugees from Congo.
In addition to preaching, the Consignor is running a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the ambassador to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and keeps in mind that the rubber lining of white beads gently bends under the lower waist of the jeans.
The ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car and his three motorcycles.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client is calling at first from one of the five telephone numbers of the Consignor.
He advises that it will be worth coming to the border in the morning, hiding the money and rowing among the traffickers crossing the border.
In order to get the status of an asylum seeker or refugee to the Ugandan authorities, it is necessary to inform them that there are, for example, from the northern part of the war zones of the case, and that there have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, the Consignor will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another identity card will be obtained.
It will help to contact the Consent in Uganda police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually the United Nations Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The ambassador knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He invoices each port separately: the lodging of an application to the Ugandan police costs approximately EUR 100, the processing of documents to a humanitarian organisation of about 150, and the migration process, for example, for a European country of EUR 4 500-7 000.
Foliota and ice-creams
Tom's a beginner smuggler, former drug offender.
Nictic Irish captain on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into the loops on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know he's in the trafficking in human beings.
At night Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from someone coming from the centre of Calais.
They're driving a highway A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it, he's been sitting there for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs over its customers' motorcycles to the resting place where the dogs sleep before they cross the canal to Brits.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure it's on its way to England, not even the Netherlands, and cut off the protective protective safety device.
It's got to be done shut up so that the dogs don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's on the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into an aluminium foil, similar to the one that is wrapped in the kitchen around a shirt or an oven.
It should prevent police heat scanners from detecting hideaways.
Some people use a sleeping bag that was left on the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping that the driver will not stop the smugglers at least before Britain.
King of Spermtors
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
Ugorical Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed King of the Undisputed Explorations of the Mediterranean, who manages maritime routes from Turkey to Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Cyprus has been operating and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has one competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he's only gonna demand the money.
One of the new methods is the luxury guardianship: Turkish ports are rented for recreational trips to take US or European families to tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are being loaded in full against the Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans who are transporting EUR 5 000 to 7 000 000 for the first time from Istanbul to a port and sea in Europe.
Customers are kept in human storage facilities, for example in old industrial plants until the time has come for them to leave.
Let's go somewhere towards the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the mark.
Once it is given, it must be quickly boarded.
Passengers must stay hidden under the cover throughout the entire journey.
The Navy can only observe how deep a ship swims, as no other signs of human population are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers release and vomit, the better.
From one luxury trip after spending, they will receive approximately EUR 53 000.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, housekeepers and other smaller factors to deal with the work for his own good.
During the summer, transport is organised by at least hundreds and Kyüčük makes millions of dollars.
He is believed to have bought through covert companies land, pharmaceutical companies and over 100 apartments he rents.
In 2011, Muammer Küçük was arrested at the same time as the Congressman of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: Death travel agency book will appear here, not next week.
American Olympic Olympics from America in his book about their illness and becoming a prostitute from being a prostitute in his book of being a prostitute in his illness and becoming a prostitute.
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells about ending his career and driving his career into a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published a breakdown of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the top of the race and ran for the second time.
But he was panicking in the finals.
At the beginning of the day, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership with a country run.
150 meters before the paint, however, his power fell.
He fell to the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself across the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered a bilateral disorder of mind.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney's races committed suicide, and he himself felt enormously successful pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The partner had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with other men.
He also overcame his husband to accept his action.
Mr. Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR 450 an hour.
He'll tell you that he's spent his money on luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of being prostituted was also that he wanted similar adrenaline games as he had been in competition for public sport.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bilateral mental disorder.
The double life of the ex-stars became apparent at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the last of Sydney's Olympics during the world's statistical cycle.
The world champion was delighted when the alliance put Norway's ski court in the direction of "Indirect".
In the opinion of at least one of its colleagues, the Norwegian ski-tooking Petter Northug has exceeded the compatibility limits.
In the summer and autumn last year, a sports agreement has been reached between the respective Nordic Ski Federation and the Norwegian Skiing Association.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been good enough for a multi-time world champion and an Olympic winner either.
The conclusion of the treaty was that the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to close the Northug off the world Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance put the skiman in charge.
"Thank you for showing your spine", Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and the Margu is about money.
You know, he'd probably like to be part of a country team in the season so he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and he will not give one athlete in his solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both financial and other privileges for many years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because it's the best.
On Tuesday he published his own publication, which assured me that he would like to be brave in Norwegian colours next season in the world cup as well as then in World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals in his career, two of which are gold.
He was involved last winter in the team that won the post-intercom.
The shield day of the stake-overs will also be spent in Northern Finland in Northern Finland.
On Thursday, 25 September, there are places to be placed in different restaurants and shops, which have been issued with the Paistin Translation shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high level of food expertise and to lower the threshold for the departure of the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants that are controlled and classified by an impartial operator are located all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of thyroid restaurants and the organization.
In northern Finland the day will be held in Vaasa, a restaurant in Foundation and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant is participating in the holiday event.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
It has been decided to make an organisation one of the most significant international events taking place in the same day around the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhahabányi magazine: Applyed to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of the district reception centre of Kauhahava.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre at the premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the region is still permanently located in the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Specials Networks Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building assembly would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interest in the territory and the airport of the former Airport School, which have not also had an impact on the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The report states that there have been negotiations for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport for the last two years.
This has been discussed, inter alia, with Mr Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and Mr Arto Rädy, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence.
The person declares to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter for the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former military area is wrong.
The district government of Kaowava dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
June: The situation of Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
The government means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions, Niinist comments to journalists in the evening after meeting with the chairmen of all Parliamentary parties in Mänttyniemi.
According to the president, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all participants.
He considers it valuable that the Government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss confidentially on fundamental issues.
Especially in these times, when we face great challenges, we are facing major challenges.
According to that, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic region.
It is hopeful that this will be the case for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and continues to have tension over the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to what it says, the NATO issue was also discussed.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Researcher: Sipilä takes a high risk of risk.
According to Sipilä, various channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio phones are one channel among others.
Such a direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This is not going to stay the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
The song did not yet want to assess how often the repeated practice of Prime Minister's television and radio calls would become.
According to Sipilä, talks may not always be transmitted to Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels report to the channel, then we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the situation of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio services be kept to citizens.
This whole thing we are talking about is quite complicated and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Sipilni takes a big risk risk.
The Media Researcher hopes that Sipilä's television phone will not tell you more about the general government's inward turn.
Is it the intention to take more strictly into account the right to decide on the public debate and to refuse the public debate on the presentation of questions? asks Professor Anu Koivu, of Stockholm University?
It is recalled by the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and that he does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be interrelated.
The pain understands that commercial media is upset by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field wouldn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting matters in democracy.
The role of the media representatives is, by definition, to aim to ensure that the political agendas are not taken on board.
According to the experience, the phone is a major risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipil would have to bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Are there any more available today for what we've heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or to say something new?
The snake says that if there is only more of the same old, you must wonder why such a large gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in that sense, in the case of not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
The risk is that Yle will be entrenched into a communication between politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interest or general policy.
A soft bet from the black bets of the black bet.
In the future speech of Sipil, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is highlighted by the media researcher.
Tonight we should look closely at what Sipila is missing and what is not, says Heikki Six, Research coordinator of the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Moon, the TV is a clever bet from Sipil, because this is how it can bring its own vision to the point of view without sounding.
This message will be made available to the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The wing skips the media and speaks directly to the people.
The risk, however, is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because there is no way to put any further questions.
According to the moon, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV... how the sweat flows, whether it shakes hands or not.
He compares Sibiha to the father figure that now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do it well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to know something about it, because here a person like he's talking directly to another person.
This (United Kingdom President Barack) Obama and partners regularly pursue their activities.
Very exceptional, very exceptional.
Erkka Railo, a political scientist, considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The director thinks that the Prime Minister would like to make Finns more generous to the tensions that are ahead of us.
On Friday, wager organisations will organise a protest and strike against the government's activities.
On Twitter, President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss the speech.
The President of the SDP Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he will challenge Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
About six months from the election.
You can't hide in the end, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The boy on the 9-year-old runaway has been found on Tampere.
The boy was in good condition at the moment we found him.
THE PHONE AND MONEY, the son's father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finnish Police Department also confirms the matter to the press.
The kid went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later, he was never contacted again.
My father thank all those who have helped me look for help.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time period.
Finnish UFC star disappointed young people in violent fading: You are at a time of anger.
Márkhani, a punishable freelancer, has published a video on Facebook, where young people are particularly attracted to immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Markhani had to give a strong talk against young street fightings.
Amikhani, born in Iran and reached Finland at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Mikhani tells me that he received a message asking me to check a Instagram account.
There are videos on the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
My past tells me that she is disappointed with the wildness of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking the ground, sitting on the other side and knocking in plainly without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos of this kind, my Markhan is updating.
It's hard to stand up anymore.
Some of the young people in the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos to social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and Finnish young people.
The fact is, you're fighting around the street all the time.
You do so by making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turkish Mimarkhan reminds me of the Turkish.
Amishani recalls that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite gross.
It's a little hard, boys, more to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests for a long time here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirhani.
My husband says that young people remember when they're close.
If they ever end up being a target for racism, then you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a few times before you go in there, guys.
The mishap says that violent action is giving birth to racism.
In the meantime, you'll get the hate I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad, and you won't make it any better, Mishrkhan decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Ly: Decisions on Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday: decisions decisions - Ly: Decisions decisions decisions on Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday on Monday Monday on Monday Monday
On Twitter, Mr Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, says that on Monday the employees' organisation will consider its position on behalf of the STC on the alternative savings it has proposed.
Lauuri Lyly commented on Twitter on a proposal from the JRC.
On Wednesday, the STKC told the government that it would present its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) to reach the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Plan, believes that the Government will adopt a proposal if the SAK, STK and Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wager organisation SAK improve its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, commented on this issue in a word on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyny, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that active agreements are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
In the past, the negotiations were terminated by the SAK when it refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: High-mindedness is threatening to go off - "It feels like it's a little funny to put on a fist"
I mean, it's kind of funny to put on your fist, if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The sensations vary from one person to another in the payee camp.
Are we supposed to call on the government to repeal or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK’s allies broke down holy hatred for the government of the kingdom.
The whole of Finland was threatened to close down.
The skin also spread to the pouts.
OAJ, a trade union for teachers, threatened the closure of schools and day care centres.
Tuesday OAJ canceled: no schools or daycare would be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STKC president of the Centre for Staff, was in agreement.
He stated that he had kept in contact with the government and that Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) had called for an alternative presentation to be a 5% productivity bonus.
Mr Sture Fjäder (Kok) rushed immediately to announce that his piece of paper is already ready.
At first, there was no yard at all.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the Joint Directors told them to stop the country on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a five-percent profit gap target.
There is no wonder that the Palestinian PSC has relations in order with the Sipilä Government.
On the right hand of Koolan, Director of Social Impact of the STK, Jukka Iineus, formerly served as special assistant for the Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
As a matter of fact, Palola described that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Slightly or not, however, the output of Palola took a little off the Finnish stand-alones, whose circulatory is the ACP Marko Pieainen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put on your fist if there's a piece of matching paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lylyn's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again".
Russia's President Sergei Naryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Finland.
In Mongolia capital city, Ulan Battor, the General Assembly of Etyj has started the House of Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments about the July Helsinki Assembly meeting.
At that time Finland did not allow the European Union to arrive at a meeting of political politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced by the European Union - a matter which the President will take to remind journalists of the journalists of.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again, Naryshkin's print by Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access had also been prevented.
Sanktios are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared a political suicide.
So Naryshkin continued to listen to Finland with a compliment and thanking Mongolia for "industry organisation".
I am sure that the parliamentary Assembly will be conducted constructively and with positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia realizes that parliamentary dialogue should not be an obstacle.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (Kok), who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock hits the real playoff mirror: "Put tight"
The Tappara and the Lock will continue today in Hakamets for bull days when both of them are on fire on the second day of the second day.
Janne Lahti expects us not to see a real festival tonight in Hakamets.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to dig 3 or 2 times a breakout from KalPa.
The rise was male, because last year's silver team was at its worst two-tone loss position.
The lock Tuesday was more like a bulldozer.
As a guest of Blues, which started the Iron Hall with a guarantee, there were round zero points, and the losses were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tightly, if any of them play the same game as last year, the Slugger Janne Lahti expected the events on the company's pages.
Tappara has become quite a playoff presser for ramen people.
In fact, during the second period of the previous year, Tappara has been cutting off the finals of the Lock just from the final series.
On both occasions, a decisive seven-mat has been required for a solution.
In the last period, the Log took the series into the box already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next side and past.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for the goal guards.
The cashiers that both sides rejected yesterday will be able to get a holler today.
The killing of Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolskin between the mouth-tocks.
Face: In a Ässs, a bad play is going on.
Sports director Solola scripted a follow-up to Mr Rautakallio, writing from Tampere, Santtu Silvennoinen.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Ballone scripted a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The explorer set up sensational styles for Apollo Creed, a heavyweight world champion of the world.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost a title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Solola's script was written by Pori for a restless ashtray story.
The name and wood-dressed pope went into the surprise of all of SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough bottomers like Rocky.
There was white Indian, Pori Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, players dyed their heads red and cut the ironies.
I'm happy to become a blonde.
JP Jalo, the great TV director, called Coach Neumann.
He took the winning silver.
She was one of the heroes.
author Dévola believes that the news of this period will work in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as head of sports for Ässi has built a bakery for evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have stunned these guys in a faraway like Rocky's pig clothes at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Vitainen, Juha Kilholman and Matti Kuparinen's privileges are in some other way than in the field of play.
The hope that Rocky VI has forgotten the main role played by Pekka Raukatalio.
Karri Stone has crucified Raukaallion Sean Connery.
Raukaalio is the most clumsy performer of Rocky's manuscript as if Connery had been in the original of 1976.
There is nothing more Rocky than a nickname in the Iron Chamber.
The game philosophy of iron iron control is not part of the rushing and small scale.
He appreciates a hard game, but there is a different thing about playing hard like a pig.
Over the past few years, the Ässien Garrett Staffford had a fight with the head of Jere Karjalainen, the killer.
He got two to ten minutes from the judges, but Raukatallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute.
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept such a game and it's not part of the ace, and the hot-fired Rautakalio woke up after the game to the nation of Satan the Commonwealth.
This season's team has been strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and conspires.
There are virtually no key players in the game age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about the skill drive.
How much have you been able to influence the game acquisitions, Pekka Raukatallio?
The recent events affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite narrow, Rautakalio replied diplomaticly.
Under the surface, the dynamometer.
In 1953, Raukatallio is obviously interested in moving to the Hope place as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance balance between the balance sheet of the ace of the three leagues of the season is equal to a loss of a total of 1-6.
I would not have liked to have written the extension part of the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa's mother.
Olga Temonen exposes that if he had met his husband Kauka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under his husband's guidance.
Yes, I'm gonna play my husband's friend's mother in a movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, acting and producer Olga Temonen's laughing at me.
He has been married to Apinna ex-bassist and director Tuukkas Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but for the first time Olga is acting under the direction of Tuuka.
The role of Olga in the early years of Akilanna's film You and I in the beautiful film are drummer Sipe Santapuki's mother, Sirkka.
Sirkka tszep and supports his son, although his father Risto (representing Lorenzo Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true example Sirka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Kaukka that he trusted me with the role he played.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone and talked to me about it.
The circus has done so much for you.
We've been through a lot of different angles through their history.
Unfortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is a drama, and the truth may have to be slightly coloured.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only person in Heinola who blindly believed that the aid would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a lie and a very tough one.
It was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some kind of inspiration, and he was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard a lot about Tuukala from this youth before the movie plans.
However, there have been little different between parents ’ stories.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing?
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola’s infamous scepter Tuuka.
Olga was a decent and kind girl who wouldn't have had anything to do with Tuuka's movie.
Mostly, he could have had a secret crush on him.
Olga says he's been working so hard with Kauka over the last 10 years that a big joint project won't be afraid.
Everything's always been great.
Now the whole production team is starting for a month in the descriptions of Heinola.
However, the couple who live in Italy are often planning to drive home because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take the whole Heinola for a month.
They've taken us very warmly, only to ask what street and when to empty us.
Iron Sky 2 Iron Sky 2 became Finnish’s most expensive play movie film. Iron Sky 2 Iron Sky 2 became Finnish’s most expensive play movie film.
The budget for the Iron Sky film by Timoresola is EUR 17 million for the film The Coming Race.
The photographs will start in Belgium in October.
Timo Vuorensola, director, begins with a picture of Iron Sky 2 in October Belgium.
Scifi film Iron Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive play movie in Finland all time with its budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been to Jalmari Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will rise once it is completed also by Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
In October the films of the film produced by Timorensola and Tero Kaukoma will begin at AED Studios, near Antwerp, in October and take eight weeks.
Timo Vurensola, director, is leaving for Belgium next week.
The guy's not scared.
I've been really sick.
I have such a relaxed file script because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
While the time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the paper.
The initial budget for the film was 8 to 10 million, but as the script was developed, the budget grew as well.
The budget is big, but it's a big shot.
However, 100 million people would be involved in the film, because each aspect and efficiency are so expensive.
Now it's so tight that there's nothing to find.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today on Wednesday a mass finance campaign and a crowd loan with an annual rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will pay back the loan.
The action film shows, among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Jew or code?
Big logos go back to their shirts to their shirts. Big logos go back to their shirts.
Trends in breasts have recently decorated large logos.
A while ago, a fashionable dresser was considering clear and big logos like Crocs in a console.
The promotion of a hood or a t-shirt mark was seen as some kind of a train.
It's not just the times that change.
Sport has become the true megatrend of the fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports patterns such as Adidas and Nike.
And as often as before, the funny and trendy border is a shame: if something is right, it starts to turn into iron and cell.
First came the norm for the core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, where the trends were surprised by the most boring basic clothes as possible, as well as by the means of separating from the mass.
Now, instead of turning on the grey base, we've already put on the base of the closet buried in the net, which the manufacturer's logo has before us.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' IDs are raves, favorite team cards, and New York Yankees' flags have made a return to the regret fashion.
The edge of the tracks start to mock the lowland Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The tradition seems to be moving from sports labels to luxury brands as well.
For example, the chest of Versace's viscosity makes clear what the sign of clothing is about.
Would you be willing to introduce your logos when you're dressed?
The Russian politician published evidence that I wasn't stuck in a tank hatch.
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, Russia Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian emergency department had to remove the large size of Zotovia's tank lock for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page where he seems to be crying about the door of a tank vehicle in a very good mood, and not on the basis of their images, it's about getting drunk or getting angry at anything.
This is bullshit.
Let's start with that I didn't go into a combat tank, but it was a train-run tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel Colonel, and I have served in Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and came out in peace, Zotov said Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I definitely didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army's TV channel that he was a former professional soldier in the exhibition.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I was curious about our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the train tanks, Zotov promised me.
Zotov also called it a fool for a writer who wrote it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like I'm stuck in a tank, it didn't happen, he said Russka and sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photo of the claim of aging has been published, although over a few days, a total of 50 000 people were present at the arms exhibition.
The argument about Zotov's getting drunk started on the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told to hang out a tank lock while trying to get out and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he got off his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published an extension in which the organisers of the exhibition explained their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his great size, was simply delayed when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said the coordinator of the exhibition Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kitilä well of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian mining company.
The grubbed process water has leaked its so-called rich sandland stream.
According to the company, measures have been started to correct the leakage.
Alla has neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water in the foaming process.
In general, water is either pumped for reuse as process water, or it is authorised to run through the surface light field into the environment.
The figure was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current terms of the permit.
The rest of the substance didn't leak into the environment.
The bleeding was found during the inspection round Monday morning.
The bleeding has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures in the pool.
The company will inform you that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansk Kukoppamaski: IMF warns against cutting too much too much pressure on the IMF to warn against being over-cut too much too much too much.
Finland's country report, published today by the IMF, is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization packaged structural reforms to cover Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction in overtime and paid holidays contributed to Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be necessary for the whole contractual system as well as for the protection of unemployment.
According to Mr. Pasi Kuopopamama, the main co-founder of Danske Bank, the structural reforms are in agreement, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of useful communication for government activities, but on the other hand there are also some warning words about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopomaski says to the Economics.
In the opinion of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates Finland's economic growth of 0.4 per cent for this year, which will rise to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske is expecting growth to remain low this year in his new cyclical forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total output was in a small increase in the summer, says Kuopomamäki.
Less attention has been paid to reduced confidence in the industry or to other so-called softer measurements.
However, there are only a few percent of the decimal places.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who died in July under Sapul Iwata, started his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwa led to Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic in the face of the game industry.
For example, Iwata responded successfully to the depression of the Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishma is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishma is a safe choice to follow Iwatan's footprints, evaluate Ace Research's analyst, Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishma is to take Nintendo with strong involvement in mobile games, but so that it does not eat bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
There are increasingly and more and more and more minor asylum seekers from asylum asylum seekers and asylum seekers who are asylum seekers who seek asylum seekers who are asylum seekers who are asylum asylum seekers who are asylum asylum seekers who are less and more and more and more and more vulnerable asylum asylum asylum seekers alone in Finland
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who have entered the country will disappear annually.
It has been reported, among other things, on the website of SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, by the Swedish Immigration Service, that hundreds of minors are lost annually in the country.
Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much do applicants disappear in the "landless" year?- In Finland a total of 156 minors' asylum applications were made in 2013 in the same year.
They lost nine.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11, Kannelmaa reported their disappearance.
On the basis of the disappearance, it may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the responsible country for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3651, of which 134 applications were rejected because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so the adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the volume growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone.
The total statistics on minors missing this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he will stress.
What happens to those who have received the appeal decision?
For example, will they be lost for example on "the blind labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service because the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, but Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of State Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of those seeking to enter the country that is not registered.
He has taken action on this.
At the EU Ministerial Conference on the issue of refugee matters, Orpo, who spoke on Monday about practical measures to ensure that asylum seekers flow through Sweden to Northern Finland through Sweden.
Nina Mikkene sells Tim Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s equipment for television and radio production is now being sold for sale by media pioneer, who has lost his job.
Mikkoinen's spouse Nina Mikkene sells in Huuuu.net equipment, which was at one of the most advanced professional tools in the sector.
The online announcement was the first to be reported on the website to Iltamacasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained under technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer described for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikonen is still confident that we can find those who are interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbys - collectors and individual studio builders, Nina Mikkonnen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Myrskylä home.
There's nothing we can do to bring all the goods with us.
I'm just beginning to think about what's going on.
Now I'm starting, Nina Mikonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio equipment.
It is clear from the findings of recent strokes that a long career man will not return to work anymore.
Nina Mikkonen notes that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was filed during the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box shop to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic is threatening to get worse thinking traffic is likely to get worse: Metro and railway wagons can stop by all Friday.
Metro and tram drivers are today deciding whether to expand their efforts on Friday's demonstration of demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the railway and tram services only for a Friday's demonstration.
During the afternoon, it will resolve whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
The operation of night and shift cuts is a bad start for drivers, so the government's plans to cut the parts into opposition.
Hilvonen wonders that standing up for the whole day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital area will be almost completely halted.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there is no movement between or far-off traffic.
Trains departing early in the morning will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left to the front end.
The members of the ACP will be absent from work on Friday morning from 3:00 a.m. on Saturday at 3:00 a.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by a superior power, the HSL informant Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't tell us exactly what bus tours are going on Friday.
On Friday, 11-13 a.m., the civil servants' organisations will organise a major demonstration on the Helsinki Railway Agency.
Aftonblad: Aftonblad: Hungarian police police used tear gas to combat refugees against the refugee refugees.
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make progress in Europe, reports AP.
According to Skys, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Even refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water tanks against people.
Muslim boy was arrested in a school in Texas, in Texas, the teacher thought a school of his own-made watch was a bomb bomb.
In the U.S.A., Ahmed Mohammed, 14 years old, has been arrested after the teacher held him at school for his own-tech watch as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News he just wanted you to meet him on your electronics record.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock would look like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation ended in the end that the boy was taken to the youth detention cell in the cuffs.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed at any time anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of committing a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had reported that the watch had appeared to be a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was definitely composed of a circuit board and a digital screen between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday, and Mohamé was punished for three days in forced school.
His father is angry about the case and the American Islamic Council in the country wonders if the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain - Director of Labour refused to sing national song.
In song God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corby is the opponent of the Monarch.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been agreed by the representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people, thought about the Labour National Representative Kate Green in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have used a song.
The Memorial was held last night to honour the fight against Germany's Luftwaffe by the British Air Force's pilots in 1940.
In its official opinion, the Labour Party defends Corbyni and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in great debt of gratitude to the heroism of the pilots of the Royal Air Force.
He (Corby) stood honorably silently during the national song, the opinion was highlighted.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the rows in the lab.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral repression, end savings and increase public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is supposed to be a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron climbed around the weekend on Twitter on Twitter with Corbyn's choice as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister's reference to our own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota is still unclear, the father of the family was waiting for a court case.
Southke Mintonka police have been investigating the family death that happened in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
Five families were found dead in their homes on 10 September and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After the first shot at the gravel of his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage in the house.
Days that have already died for days.
They found a family after they were worried about the absence of children at school.
On the basis of this notification, the police went to the house at the inspection visit and found a huge house on the other side of the family.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been killed for days.
Millions and successful company.
The investigation of Southke Mintonka's chief, Michael Sitari, is still ongoing.
The cause of the bleeding is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site of AllNurs.com.
In 2014, in StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've been offered 50 bids for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a company, but not yet.
The success was reflected, among other things, that the Short's family bought a house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million a day.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers different prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there were no disturbing comments on the Short site, and therefore they had lost their customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered me cake coffee coffee.
In addition, the three owner's prize was awarded at the destination event at the Finnish Hippos month's horse owner prize.
This is great, Loir commented on his generous honor plan.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned a win of EUR 100 000.

The amazing gesture that's going to come from the NHL star - "The gift made by all the greatest athletes of all time"
The Grand Star of Montreal, P. K. Subban, has donated $10 million (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital for the children of Montreal hospital.
According to the health information provided by the hospital, it is the most recent individual donation made by athletes to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million a year ago.
Thus, Subban’s contribution amount is significantly higher than its nine million dollars per year.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a lobby bearing his name from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have, in the first place, benefited significantly from local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a sum of money for another large hospital in the city to receive a PET scanner for cancer research purposes.

ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and planning recommendations for advanced cyber-security solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of the best practices in cybersecurity.
The Company will continue to update the report on the basis of the ASRB's findings.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consultation firm, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, generate and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in information processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately EUR 52 000 in Finland.
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as the moon rises up.
Finally, the car begins to be also in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS information now that the car world's eyes are on Frankfurt's auto show.
Ford's new four-wheel RS accelerates by a 2.3-litre, 350-Hero-power engine of 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed of 2.6 km per hour.
There is also an interesting price, which is initially reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell us when it comes to information.
The favorite mark Kia introduced two new developments at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - such is the new Sportage and Optima.
The second generation of Sportage, which Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever-growing street-ground market, is certainly more important than the two new ones.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaum, created under the leadership of the Guillaum, is more round than ever before.
A quarter of the time has come to this place, and the car is more efficient than the air.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but it has added a 1.6-litre turbo that develops 177 horses.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in the spring of 2016.
Even before the shift of the year, they've got new Kia Optimats into our country.
Suddenly, the news doesn't look different, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
The building is equipped with 1,7-litre turbodiesel and 2,0-litre petrol engines.
The next summer, the speeds were high when the Optima GT, equipped with a 2,0-lit turbo engine, arrived next summer.
At the same time, the sale of Optima Farmer will begin with its arrival.
Chisu returned back to the stage... blew up in a brave suit of armor.
Singer Chisu is involved in Life for a child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pantsuit has a bright, open neck hole.
The apartment offers a beautiful presentation of the crown of the Siron’s crown of the singer star.
A total of crowned gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a mother singer has obtained her pregnancy pounds with a tighten of light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will soon be over a year.
The singer published his first singles from a new album in August.
Back to the stage and coming up to the general public after a long break, I'm not really excited about it.
I'm sorry I've had everything to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish his new and fourth album in a few weeks' time called Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired us to make new songs.
At this point, I'm wondering if people are gonna find my new album, Chisu is wondering.
Kim Kardashian's maternity style again, now we're looking at breasts.
True-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives topics to one after another.
She presents her pregnancy clothing and her breast equipment fairly in her sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 p.m., when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian, a husband from Kanye West's gig with her sister, Kourtney Kardashian.
Mother's mother's dress is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress when lightning lights flash.
The last time Kardashian was dressed up in an amatenic maternity ward, he visited his friend's dinner party in New York only a few days ago.
Black superstitious boots that highlighted the importance of honor.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the opening act had its pregnancy births.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, the competition is terrible.
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to take a look at the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary on Speeding Dolls (Speaking dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues spoke about a clean model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered the six hard truth about Leloup behind the scenes.
Every season starts empty.
Even if during the previous season you would have been in the costumes of top designers, the new season will start again on casting.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for work with hooks.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that the place of residence is a room or apartment in which fashion houses house their model.
If you are very young, and your mother can't travel with you, it can't be too difficult to be lonely.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
It's not just the density of one sort.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Design models and designers are always together and operate as a support network.
When fashion weeks run out, the difference is bad.
Models want to be in this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are afraid that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own person, too.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But in the work of the model you can also express yourself.
Models at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York is currently having fashion plans where designers will reveal their model for next year.
In style, modified by Roope Salmine, filmed by an unknown Audilanta musician.
Roope Salmine performs Antti Laatalaa, the founder member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta Group.
Lautala was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtaen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rapper, and in this movie I'm playing 16-year-old guitarist, Salmine laughs.
I've never wanted to see a real Antti before the photographs, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I just learn from his music style from a video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
A man who can trust Roope Salminen and Dogs is not going to play the role.
The punk masters come from a man's natural nature.
The stars, in the punk episode of the stars, must have been seen by many before, and also if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our presence has never been a little bit of a time, but we'll always be on our way.
In 1993-2004 the main actors of the beautiful film by Tukka Temos, who played the bass, were released today.
A nuclear force that became familiar to the band's audience is being presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumuli Sipe Santa Santa present Teppo Manner, singer from Toni Witasta Tattu Sinisalo based Tuukka Temo Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salmine gave me a tip about his coming nest last night when he told me in Snapchat mysteriously that he would prepare himself for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new story yesterday in Instagram, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, seen earlier in the mustache, has driven his face to silropos, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psych psychologist counsel: This is how you tell your children about refugees from refugees.
In recent days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking Europe.
Or should I at least tell you at all?
It does not have to be spoken with violence, a member of the SP crisis group, a psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not let them watch the news alone.
Small children can't always understand what they've seen, and it can go around thinking and anxiety, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news about refugees or has heard about it elsewhere, it is worth speaking up.
It is a good thing to have a conversation about the child's basis and listen carefully to what he is asking for.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You shouldn't be afraid of anything, even if you're upset and afraid of yourself.
The younger child is closely following the conduct of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, they also feel that they are safe.
Major children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents should be happy to speak with them if they are concerned about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well at all.
Parents, together with children, can think about how our family views this.
In the end, do we think that the world is a safe or secure place, at the end of the day?
Parents may also have different farming perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family is also talking about difficult matters, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come to life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: " Teach your child to help the weaker".
Your own powers at the end?
You may still be a good parent to your child.
Verminable Ballsalamaa is difficult to control.
Perttu Põhjola got hit in the middle of the strike by Apila Ballsalama.
It was only open to profits and seconds, until a collapse occurred at the end of July at the end of Tampere.
Since the slave fell to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a safe period of time from his veterinarian.
The explanation for a step-by-step was made clear in the observation.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the least of its head, but the tearing of it required two drug courses.
Since Apilan Ballosalma had to be on a light move, the North says it was a good idea to be surprised at the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time another SE-mama after Taruntuvus.
Apilan Pillosalma was under pressure from a break when it was possible to drive normally only a few weeks away.
Those things at the end of the little bending of attention were understandable," The North says.
The coach assumes that a fair competition made the slaves sharp.
I'm sure the horse's score moved on from it, and I hope it's even more balanced.
Apilan Ballalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it's not fun, it could have been thrown fat without any illness.
On the day of the day, the slaves have, on the other hand, removed the lightning rule that the opponents have been wonderful.
At the speed of the match-offers will not be able to do anything to Pillosalma, from which even warm rides are off.
The hopes of the north are a pesis run in the Vermo.
However, the difference is how Apilan Ballsalama agrees with it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might even fall under and like that.
I hope that the slave would be more calm than Turku's leaving.
Apilan Pillosalma is capable of coming out of the ring when he's in good condition, and we're going to drive out of victory with it, coach permission.
This is why you can't get rid of any corrupt iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be deleted in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports Tim Cook Buzzfeed's interview with the company's CEO.
Apple iPhone has a series of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioskio, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkis come to mind.
The latest addition to these programmes is Apple Watch, who entered an emergency update on iPhone phones, even though it is necessary only for Apple smart owners.
According to the Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are deleted, it may cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook your supplement.
So according to Cook, Apple is investigating it, because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
The euro area inflation slowed to 0.1 per cent in August to 0.1 per cent of GDP in August.
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices slowed down the downward trend in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised the estimate for a couple of weeks to a slightly downward trend of 0.2 per cent.
The inflation rate was 0.2% in July.
The so-called underlying inflation decreased by 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate for the whole of 28 EU countries in the EU was at zero in August.
In July, the rise increased by 0.1 per cent.
The highest number of euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, the lowest rate of inflation was 1.9 per cent, which was the lowest in prices.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU harmonised index.
The euro area's inflation remains a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) which is a two-percent increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB estimates an average inflation rate of 0.1 per cent for the euro area on average for this year.
Next year, the rise will rise to 1.1%, the central bank will anticipate its new inflation forecasts as announced at the beginning of September.
The United States Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy on monetary policy.
The United States's next recession will start at a speed of less than one year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed is again starting to raise interest rates for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the deficit will begin before the next recession begins.
Fed has suggested that it will start with interest payments possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Therefore, the next recession can press ahead at the fastest time by next autumn and as a series of courses on the financial markets before that.
Or at least that happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets function the way they have been, and if they react to Fed's money tightening as they have done before.
Such conclusions have reached the conclusion of the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a wide range of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank shared the Long-Term Asset Return Study report on over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The strategies developed by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market thereafter.
Instead, they present how the economy and the markets have previously behaved during and after Fed's interest rates, using the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine which key parameters of economic and financial markets are now the same or the same model as in previous interest rates - and possibly the result of that.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now more well-balanced with the increase in interest rates than once before since the 1950s.
It may not even a year at the beginning of a recession, but not one year, nor one year, nor one year, nor one year, nor another.
The monetary policy of the Fed and its leaders, which decided on its current regime, have been in the middle of last summer and the beginnings of the year have suggested that the time is beginning to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate period for more than nine years may already take this week.
This will be settled during the mid-week and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee meeting of the Board of Feds will meet on the occasion of its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised the so-called Fed Funds Guidance Rate in June 2006.
At that point, the relatively regular but at a time, relatively small percentage point of interest rate of 0,25 percentage points ended at a rate of 1,25 % of the interest rate of Fed increased from 1,25 % to 5,25 % of the interest rate.
In 2007, financial market relief began from the most risky housing financing difficulties in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis became a global nightmare of the day of the judgment.
The largest recession was reached in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic shocks began more slowly than has typically been the case since previous Fed's interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were more severe and severe than once since the 1930s' recession.
Deutsche's strategies have been reflecting the rises and falls of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950 and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
From the 1950s they will be making clear on the interest rates and their economic and financial implications.
The onset of the recession has taken less than a year at the earliest of the first interest payments, mostly less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
The increase in the exchange rate on the financial market has ended in two years from the start of Fed's interest rates.
After the early 1950s, Fed has set up a cycle of about a dozen different dimensions.
Each time there has been some deviations from others, and the coefficient is relatively scarce in the review, so it is unlikely that there is any certainty about the impact of the following interest rates.
The strategies also remind me that this time many things are different.
Not better than that.
Interests too low too long too long too long too long
Even decades of research work may not be undisputed because of the crucial causes of the financial crisis.
But the three factors that led the crisis and the causes that have increased its power of destruction are likely to be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks of the world in the 21st century considered their steering rates too low for too long.
They placed traces of the technocouve system, and they raised the next one at the same time.
2) The volume of debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and even too large already, increased by overvaluation of central banks from monetary policy to even greater.
Born in the economic history of the year before, the largest debt bubble in the history of the economy was born.
3) In particular, in most cases, the worst-case financial holding of the financial sector was the result of the major exchange rates of shares in real estate, bonds and commodities in most areas of the financial market until then.
Moreover, it is unlikely that there would be a very severe dispute that, in the case of increasingly complex debt gaps, the increased financial markets were extremely dangerous and unstable, when Fed and the other central banks last put up interest rates.
The valuation curves, which had been provided by the debt-backed financial structure, did not last as long as they had been after the interest payments had begun and the debt financing costs had turned up.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Largest bubble and more debt to you.
Deutsche's strategies don't think what's next, but they give the topic of nuclear technology by mentioning, for example, the following elements:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now held the momentum of their monetary policy even more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis, they have now been even lower than even longer.
(2) Debt has not long been insane as it was ten years ago, but now the debt is at its worst literally cheaper than it is to say.
Thus, the financial and real economy debt stock has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt debt ratio has become more severe than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity provided by the banks has largely remained on the financial market and the key types of securities and assets have slowed down at most since the peak or never before the financial crisis.
Not only are the strategies of late feeling on financial market warning signs, but they also note that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the decades of the most difficult recession to the model ever since.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but in contrast, the pressure and risks of financial markets are equally higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten up its financial resources.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French bank Societe General's strategic Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may seem.
He has already trained international investors from the Bank for a good time to the following full versions of Fedi:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles will break, and soon it will be time for Fed to move forward in order to shut down financial flows with even larger QE-breaks.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are due to the HP Business Service Party, the company reports.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., a company that focuses on business sales in November.
HP had the largest number of staff in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the non-recurring costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The cost reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has balanced its business already so that none of its clients will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating income.
In the second year, its three main customers brought 65 per cent of their operating income.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after the update of the iPhone Apple update of the iPhone for a new operating system after the update of Apple's iPhone.
The new operating system may be requested by going to the Settings application, clicking "General" and then selecting "A software update".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation, since the "The Update Date failed" statement has been published on the screen.
In order to avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst carcase to pass or try to update via iTunes.
Phone the user in the final process.
This may include the removal of applications to obtain status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process by a new tool that proposes deleted applications and then reinstall them when completing the update.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is loaded or in close proximity to the charger during the update that the battery does not stop during the operation.
If the download level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery is in the middle, it may result in an update failure.

Yle: Minister Berner has acted in the Government of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company’s activities were related to so-called tax planning.
It is a question of a Luxembourg-Stri II LuxCo company, which was appointed member of the Board of Directors, Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself said that he had submitted a notice of resignation of membership this May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the chain of registration takes place in an agreed timetable, Berner says in Yle's interview.
In post post-inf post post-fusion required membership of the merger, the membership required after the merger followed after the merger.
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company.
Kährs is a parking manufacturer who joined the Finnish parking manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served as the Government of the Karlia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger with the Government of Kährs, as well as the Luxemburg company.
According to Yle, the owners of Kährs go through a multi-port property structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted a government membership at the Luxemburg Company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Government of Karlia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was requested for the company that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to take care of the capital benefits of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that income from our capitals of Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that it is safe to base in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capitali's ownership does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure established for tax havens is because the largest owner of Kährs’ capital fund Triton had already been prepared for acquisitions by a Luxemburg holding company.
Espoo opens the reception centre of the company managed by the company's reception centre in Espoo.
The first reception centre held by the company will be opened in Espoo in Otaniemi for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this evening.
The number of places may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service shall establish a reception centre at the property of the former Finnish Rescue College.
The operation is maintained by Luuna Oy, whose sector is particularly concerned with the production of health care and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luuna Oy agreed among other things on the Centre's security arrangements.
The JRC will prepare an alternative occupational blackmail package to prepare an alternative work-life package.
The JRC is proposing to prepare an alternative package for the government's labour market blackmail.
The organisation also hopes that other employment centres should be included.
According to President Palola at the moment, the emphasis is on Friday's demonstration.
An alternative way to reduce labour prices will be restored afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out that the organisation’s administration meeting would take a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that, on the other hand, the Central Business Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The EESC's eco-economics have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, which is €2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if a party is awfully eager to have a conversation if there is one ratio to 100.
Palla: The negotiations had been constructively constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication of its own package to the Parliament and start the preparation of reforms.
The fire did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
The discussion with the Government is in existence according to Palola, and it has been constructive about him all the time.
In particular, in the field of the STK, on Sundays, Palola says that there is a sick spot.
The organization requires the government to resort to compulsory legislation in which it would be involved in the implementation of part of the crises.
According to the PSC, Palola does not allow the option package to be prepared with the relevant SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the labour-life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the salary for the first sick days will be cut, the overtime will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The STC stresses that the central organisations have called on employees to express themselves, and that there has been no strike.
The plan Fjeder congratulates its thanks.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Plan, congratulates the JRC on its communication on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjeder, the JRC is now coming to the same lines with the Plan, since the Plan has long been developing an alternative model for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare a presentation for surgery as an alternative.
Antti Palolan's STK told us earlier on Wednesday that he would prepare new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
The plan was announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time to negotiate the five-percent competitive jump as an alternative for operations by the government of the country as an alternative to operations.
The plan has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to look at the terms and conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Agenda lines, as the JRC has done on Wednesday before.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The scheduled Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä is very exceptionally speaking about the state of Finland's economy on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for the corresponding Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister when he held the famous radio call, which meant the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then held a number of calls during the winter and the continuation of the war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho, instead of President Mauno Koivistö, gave a New Year's speech, but it was more of a ceremony.
In autumn 1976, President Urho Kekkonen quit on television the strike of train drivers.
Single phone, monarchist makeup
The speech by Sipil has raised all day criticism and guess what I'm going to have to do with it.
Mr Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Union, said on Twitter that "The Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinist, "one phone has already been seen.
leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the Erkki Judge of the SDP condemned the fact that "monarchist us: Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, appealed to Sipilä's dialogue: "I have six months of election.
No single presence from Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is it you are afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was submitted directly by Mr Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, and by Jyri Häkäser, CEO of EK.
Yöle has been criticised for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered this and noted that it was part of the public service mission to promote the entire Finnish-wide publicity of the line Yle’s publication director, Ismo Silva Yle’s news.
It's like the time of the Tammelestime.
The speech has also raised the facets of beggars.
The dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the kids will be stowed and dressed as their best.
Mom's gonna put on the nicest bitch and Dad's gonna tie his neck to the tie.
At 9:00 a.m., it's slowing down to television than I used to remember at the time of Me Tammelois," writes bbigar Saku Timonen.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also asking why the Finnish Government sits in its tax havens for millions who hide their capitals from its tax havens, who make laws of mercy to other tax-maker friends, and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the State is out of the money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is the Green Left from Tampere University Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by the other bingon.
Do we hear about the same boat, the common coal, living in debt, and the team crew?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it begins and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
A Ahtari in Guardian: The Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for a Russia's exclusion from Al-Assad proposal.
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by which the Syrian President Bashar al-Asad was allowed to abandon his power, reports President Martti Ahtisari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan in which al-Assad would, for some time, have been swept away from the power in a elegant manner.
However, the Western countries did not take on the proposal because they thought that al-Assad would fall in any case a few weeks.
Ahisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed him in a bilateral discussion with three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and Al-Assad immediately had to be contacted and the withdrawal of Al-Assad had to be done with restraint.
I know, Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we will be able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down in Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember the interview with Guardian.
Diplomatics did not comment.
The Ahtisaari tells me that he communicated the message of Tshurkin to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaari, there is no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Mr Ahtisaari's arguments, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements he would have been in possession of.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle East Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, has expressed doubts about the Ahtisaari talks because, according to his experience, Russia was not prepared to discuss Al-Assad's fate at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
In a few moments, Ahtisaer claims that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow council.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
At the same time, he would have suspected in that case that it would have been Putin's passion to maintain power with some kind of supporter of al-Assad.
The refugee flow of our own efforts is our own fault.
During the negotiations in the Ahtsaari, approximately 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is what we do.
I see no other choice but to take good care of these people.
Now we're paying the bill that we made for ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the paper.
An asylum asylum asylum seekers’ organisation centre with a trap to Tonnio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The Centre would be set up in the centre of the city in an empty building of the Tornio Joint Assembly.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin sanomat announced that the council would have already decided to present the school building to the Ministry for a space resolution.
According to Vice-President Saul Hööppinen, vice-president of the Tornio municipal council, that is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the team wanted to take a formal decision, we decided to invite the council to the meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specified the matter to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the local meeting.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision would be positive," says the "Best".
According to General Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and quickly responded to the matter.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at one time would be able to cooperate.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so that would be in mind, Nousian says.
Sipilpil still still hopes for a job market option for blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) the half-life of the public holidays would only cover part of the government's efforts to calculate the labour price.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the organisations of the labour market are successful in such an agreement.
Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament that he had not been in contact with the organisations of the labour market.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternative means of blackmailing working life reported by the government.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will, of course, be happy to receive it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, half-life would be a means, because it would be directed at almost all employees, unlike, for example, the surgery planned by the government on Sundays.
Organisations could agree between themselves on the operation of holiday allowances because they have been registered under collective agreements instead of law.
On Wednesday next week, the Government will report to the Parliament on labour-life crises as a communication from the Government.
According to the team, the suggestions of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final payout either.
The legislative work will then take off, i.e. the train is on the move and it will get harder and harder all the time.
This is a very good time.
It's not going to be long on such matters if there's a will, Sipilä made it up.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the change in the statutory working hours for unpaid holidays without shortening the working hours of the year.
In addition, the salary for the first days of health is cut, the overtime are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75%, and holidays are reduced to 50%.
The reforms will be implemented as a compulsory legislation by trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of these actions, the civil society organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political laws.
The Law of the Tohma Lake's council approved the extension of the storage stock of the juice hall.
The mandate of the Tohmajärvi was unanimously approved but the extension of the stock stock of the Administration of the Nordic Koivu Oy, called the juice hall, was slightly extended by the Administration of the Nordic Koivu Oy.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was larger and more expensive than the originally mentioned project.
The busy schedule is too busy.
It was also a little wonder that the order was not known a year ago when the decision was taken on the previous extension was made.
At this stage, the extension of the stock at 400-450 sqm was approved in the investment programme, but the funding will be decided as part of the interim report.
On the new agenda we were talking about an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but at the meeting of the Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the local community.
The municipality has no risk, since the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Population (ps.) was justified.
Another place for the sole language of the herd even lies in Joensuu, where there is a place for the tongue of the herjala in the city of Joensuu.
The city’s government reduced its previous firm stand to bring cattle-language street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the election of the tradition of cattle throughout the country.
Joensuu is not a capital city of cattle because it has no historical grounds and is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the River region has been more famous for the Eastern Savoval murders.
After a new decision, there will be no sign of nickname in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, well prepared to use the language of the cattle, for example in the information tables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude that the city recommends to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is a formal one-lingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of the language of a cattle who live and change strongly in Northern Karelia as well.
The language of Karelia is still unique to the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both can well benefit from various marketing activities in the region.
The end of the train connections will cut the life force of the county.
Train connections surgery hit the county's vital vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the business and competitiveness of the county.
And that seems to me whether you can live and work here at all, Karen Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu, wonders whether you can live and live here.
He also points out air carriers, which have also been on several occasions in the course of the report.
For the whole region, it is important that we do not have the opportunity to reduce government measures, as is the case now.
The impact of the cessations of these transport links, for example, on employment should be seen, for example, by Karjalainen.
The worsening of transport links creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the principal of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen, says.
He points out that bad connections also affect a faculty that is very mobile and travels a great deal because of research.
The recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing of the university towards Western Finland is already difficult as the transport links are weak in the cross-border direction.
At present, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them again are New Zealand, which is partly explained by the direct connection to the train.
Joensuu became one of my soars for Siu’s war.
The view of the Government of Joensuu on the Local Siu War project is apparently unanimous, but one of my lines is also one of them.
Pentti Central Hall (sd., p.e.) presented the entire project for abandonment at the Government's Monday meeting, but his performance became unprofitable.
The Board of Governors approved a draft resolution by Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the municipal council, which will give final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train train from Kotka Kotka to Kouvola will end next year next year.
Personal train services from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less often than one train couple.
There will be changes to passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train partner will stay away, but another five days will get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state savings.
The purchase money for the next four years of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out of the way.
The rescue facility let off the climb to the roof of a 12-year-old who didn't get my own way down from the roof.
The situation was born in Tornionä on the Keto Road at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storeed wooden house, where there are no ladders that can be taken to the roof at all.
It did not stop a crew that decided to climb up the roof of the house along the mask of the radiomagists next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the other people were making noise and the passersby alarmed the rescue facility's position to assist the last person on the roof who was safely left behind on the surface by means of bets.
FedEx's operating profit is suspicious, lowers the tax tax year 2016 prospects for 2016.
FedEx reports depressing results from the latest quarter, and the delivery waste cut its entire year's profit forecast, as a result of reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it was going to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the rest of their holidays.
In recent years, FedEx announced that it would be hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the rest of the holidays.
Its share decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening time of the middle week.
FedEx Corp. says it will expect the tax year to end next May to end 10,40-10,90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, let's tell you what happened at the FactNet survey.
Despite the average price increases of 4.9 per cent, which entered into force on 4 January, and despite the higher fees that started in November for land transport of heavy or large packages, the lower outlook was, on average, 4,9 per cent.
The company said that it expected operating profit to grow from previous year, as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and the online trade is growing.
Fred Smith, president and CEO, said that "the company is going to be "responsibly, taking into account expected weaker economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
Planned pay for the holiday period was announced day after the competitor UPS told me that he was going to hire 90 to 95,000 extra workers, about as much as it hired last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's profit was USD 692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year's.
The profit per share was $2.42, which is left with the average estimate of $2.44. The 12th analysis questionnaire was carried out by Zacks Investment Investment Research.
Net sales increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were expected to be worth $1 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been suffering from a reduction in international priority transport, which has stopped the development of its turnover in the Express Unit.
However, the rise in the network trade has improved the performance of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the land unit turnover increased by 29 per cent, but operating income was basically the same for the cost of larger packages and for the cost of own insurance.
Express unit revenues were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight operations decreased higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening order, FedEx's shares decreased by $3.55 per cent to $11.55 per cent.15.
FedEx closed on Tuesday 11 per cent in the fall for this year and 17 per cent in the record of 11 June.
The governors of the central bank are sitting two days a week around a huge mahogany table in a long-awaited meeting deciding whether the time has come to raise the steering rate for the first time for almost a decade.
On the other hand, the two-storeed meeting room of the central bank is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Central Bank, and his colleagues must place the financial interests of the nation above all else.
The Congress has placed a dubious responsibility on the central bank’s shoulders: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after a large recession, central bank leaders have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a crucial factor in a decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot be predicted.
While most of the data shows a steady growth, recent droughts in the global financial markets may have already been made more stable by the staff of the central bank in advance, as is the case for increasing instability, and fear of how it would affect if the federal fund limit value was raised by even one quarter.
"I understand the labour market and inflation are the first and most important factors to be followed", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert of Stiel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for justification for a recovery of interest rates, there is an increased uncertainty on the world market that is sufficiently valid yet," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been agreed on, which, at the same time, is causing tension to the economy.
According to Bloomberg's recent research, about half of economic experts predict that the interest rate will rise this week.
The financial markets expect the central bank to slow down, as the key indicator indicates that growth is only about 30%.
This refers to the fall in the securities market if the central bank raises the level if the decision-makers would then not be able to ease the blow by promising that the next raise will not take place in the near future.
The industrial average index for Tuesday Down Jones rose by 228.89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new chapter of 16 599,85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Marketss Research Group's main economic expert on the main economics division.
"It's surprising if the central bank is raising interest right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must see a lot of trouble in their guidelines in order to support the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank is operating.
A month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates by a quarter this month, so the first small step towards a slow tightening up of the monetary situation, which would ensure the stability of the recovery of the United States.
Yelle has stated in spring and early summer that he expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are demanding more economic development in their complaints.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell by 5.1 per cent in the last month, which is a figure of seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of an increase in wages.
While inflation remains below the central bank’s 2 % annual target, the central bank’s decision-makers believe that access to this is a temporary effect on the price of significantly reduced oil.
The economy is "higher than even higher interest rates, and also needs them to take into account the strict situation of the labour market", states Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world were distorted last week when China devalued its currencies.
The Dow Jones industrial average ratio decreased by up to 16 per cent from its May record when investors were afraid that the slowing economic growth in China would also slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the peak of the May peak.
To the central bank’s decision-makers, the wholesale market is an additional element in a complex equation, which tells us when the interest rate should be raised.
"Withoutout these financial market events and recent weeks of news on the weakness of the Chinese economy, policymakers would tighten the level at this meeting," says Stephen D. Osolier, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the impact.
"The possible effects on the US economy are still very unclear, and they do not have much information in their use regarding the consequences of China's events," says Olier.
International economic well-being is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank of the federal government has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
In 2013, the present President, Ben S. Bernanken, pointed out that the central bank can "develop" the increase in the amount of money, caused upheavals in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, officials of the central bank are expected not only to progress elsewhere, but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Kabell, Head of the Global Strategy Strategy for Envestnet Inc.
In this month, Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the State of Virginia, noted that "the Central Bank has previously overrerereacted its financial market operator, which has been influenced by being separate from the basic factors of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which has taken decisions, has called for an increase in interest rates, and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee's right to vote, calls for an example of the decisions taken in 1998-99.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "Despite its limited, identifiable impact on economic growth in the United States", Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank repealed these cuts.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only in a time of major crisis, as when the market collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate setting committee.
The last miller's not coming anywhere near that level, Posen says.
"No one wants a situation in which interest rates rise is feared because the market is getting worse," says Posen, Chairman of Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act continues to contain a dubious requirement and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

SPRS in Brazil has invented a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good food during breast-feeding by publishing images of babies sucking breasts with pictures of inappropriate foods.
Rintamato is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients needed to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study suggests that the addition of calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Professor Robert Waterland, Texas’s Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, abnormal diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
The Seven Channel Sunrise program is a favorite in viewer rates, despite the fact that the Nine Channel companies are being informed about the management of the Today Show program.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's attack on Canberra to news the latter's announcement of the leadership of the Liberal Party failed to increase the number of Today viewers.
The morning programme for the Nine Channel was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull was swept away by Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, which is run by David Koch and Samantha Armyage, was stuck in London as part of the week's long international broadcast series covering also Dubai, New York, Niagara falls and Cancun.
The distance between weights did not seem to interfere with the Australian TV viewers, since the average of Sunrise’s viewers was 397 000 in five state capitals, while Today’s figure was 339 000.
The mean of Toda rose slightly from Monday (317 000) to last Tuesday (283,000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has captured Sunrise in recent months.
In August, the mean for Today was 318 000 and for Sunrise 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40 000 and 50 000 observers.
So far during September, Sunrise averages 349 000 viewers while Today's figure is 314,000.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The changes in winds this morning will blow even more than in Parliament.
Karl and Lisa can do well, please ask me a question.

The big news from the Seven Channel was 800 words series with a former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered quite an impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells of the father who has recently remained widowed, who decides to move to New Zealand's coast with two children.
The critics have wondered whether Thomson is the most popular series of power on its own without the Rafers Star Rebecca Gibson.
Last night's results gave us real certainty.
The Seven Channel The X Factor program was a strong favorite with 1.336 million viewers, easily winning the The Block series (838 000) and the TBL Fairies series (726,000).
The Seven Channel had a suspicious fate on the second night of the Chase Australia series.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half-hour vision programme (17-17.30) collected 446 000 viewers from the middle.
The second half hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers - which was enough to gain from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
Monday night, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewing average was 520 000 viewers, and the second half-hour figure was a peak of 70,000 people.
The average for Hot Set was 620 000.
The fall in the second night average for Chase Australia will give Nine the confidence that Hot Seattle will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce the viewers of McGuire's programme.

The final three agrees that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markos could accidentally reveal who wins The Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept extremely secret from the one Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't slip who got the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, one day before the three became two, they could, however, deliberately give a hint of the winner's identity.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women were throwing themselves into the ground when they told me how Wood was a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness as the reason why they wanted to be his partner.
However, when they were asked, "If Wood's last rose is not for you, who should it go to?", their answers could offer a revelation about who won the heart of the bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markosk quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for him after themselves.
The relationship between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been complex since the first day.
"From the moment I walked in the house, (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the whole series," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really close to the ground, it's fun to be with him", Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxing together.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood would be a great match.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "it's the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game... I'm with my whole heart here," he said.
When asking who Wood should be chosen if not for him, Mackay was valuable.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I keep as much of the remaining girls, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in his amendment to the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him for his impressive open training day after the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team as well as Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne's change bench for the rest of the game after the turn of Australia's rugbylige dropped the ball when the first flight kick came back to the team when they won the team in Minnesota on Tuesday at 20-3 a.m.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and allowed Hayen to return the next flight shot and took him into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real nature of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his new entrants a balconies in front of the other team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
49ers' special editor Cam Inman reported that Haynea also encouraged Special Team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the dropped ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the air blow that the Vikings in Minnesota caught on the first game screen.
This really wasn't the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wished for a man in NFL debyyt.
Hayen was seen cursing on the way from the field after the drop, and later he told the Australian radio light to the Hamish & Andy 2DayFM channel at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"That was just one of these things, you have to think about the next game and it's on it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared it with his hacking in the 2007 Original debut when the input in his own goal area led to the Queensland goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted to his Instagram account in a photo with fans extending the Australian flag.
Elton John and the President of Russia Vladimir Putin meet in order to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, the richest Russian man, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun on the Siperian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was sentenced, his oil company Yukos was imprisoned and his efforts to support democracy was limited.
4 killed a police officer when shooting rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in the south of Nepal after the police shot rubber bullets into a crowd that showed their views against the new country's draft constitution, the Authority reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior official of the region, said that more than 1,000 protestors had gathered outside the police station and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then shot him in the air before he got into the rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to have been killed, but which are traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In recent weeks' violent demonstrations, which took place in various parts of Nepal, the members of the ethnic group named Madhes said that the new provinces set up under the proposed new Constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in the West Nepal when the Tharus Group demands its own country.
After 10 August, at least 40 people have died in acts of violence, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to distribute the country to provinces - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but it is a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
The new constitution has been designed since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process since April's devastating earthquake killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted this week on the Constitutional clauses in their Review, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could accept it by Sunday.
The United United States National Hurrican Center NHC says that on the south side of Cape Cape Verde, there is a 60% chance for a hurricane storm.
On the low pressure front, located about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verden island group, there is a 60% chance to develop into a tropical thunderstorm over the next 48 hours, the US National Hurricane Center told on Tuesday.
On the other hand, the exact low pressure front, located in the middle of the Cape Verden island group and the Little Antillies, is also a 60% chance to develop into a tropical circular storm over the next two days, the weather forecast center in Miami added up.
Google will start a donation campaign for the goal of the donation campaign to collect $ 11 million to refugees refugees refugees and refugees.
Google Inc (GOGL.O) has published a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees to come to Europe in their escape from war cracks and poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective on its published donation campaign blog.
Instead of making a statement by the Director, it was from his personal experience that he wrote about the Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled from Kabul when he was seven years old with his family.
"Our journey belonged to numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as to hunger, thirst, coldness and darkness," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But after the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Donations will receive four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told me that it is equal to the same amount for every donation made on the Google.com/refugeeriereef site worldwide up to $5.5 million, with a total target of USD 11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe has occurred since the Second World War and has been the main cause of a civil war in Syria for four years, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many will also flee war on Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

A rash may help mildly obese diabetes mellitus.
According to the new study, the benefits of dilution surgery for patients with mildly overweight type 2 diabetes can be at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say that do these mildly overweight diabetics live longer after weight loss than those who are treated in other ways than surgery.
"A long time to obtain mortality data", Dr. Robin Blackstone says, he's a weight cutting expert who wrote a script for a new research into JAMA Surgery magazine.
For dilution or bariatric surgery, different methods are used to reduce abdominal size.
They reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects involved in the study have been sick and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of weight to length, is considered to be normal when it is between 18,5 and 24,9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if the person BMI is more than 30, he is considered obese.
You can count on your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the purpose of this new research, researchers in the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric reduction, type 2 diabetes medicinal treatments in people who were mildly overweight.
The study showed that the average BMI of cut-off subjects decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI remained broadly the same in 29 persons who were treated by other means than surgery.
Of the cut-offs, 36% of the patients had improved total and 28% in part diabetes.
For the sake of comparison, in the medicinal product-treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL column "they were generally better in the surgery group", writers said.
Researchers also monitored patients with haemoglobin levels of A1c that reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
The haemoglobin level of A1c should remain below 7%, researchers write.
Post-operative haemoglobin level decreased from approximately 9% to about 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
This improved haemoglobin levels of A1c did not, however, reduce mortality over a period of five years," says Chief Research Officer Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared the average results between two different types of surgery.
At the age of five, when compared with the gastric reduction group, the gastric bypass group had dropped more weight (18,7 and 14,2 kg), decreased more than its weight index (7,4 and 5.1), decreased the haemoglobin A1c level by more (3.1% and 2.1%), and had been more likely to achieve complete diabetes retention (46.9 % and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix's Blackstone says that although the study does not look like survival or surgery after five years, there are findings from Sweden, where surgery led to longer life in more severe people.
In a Swedish study, it was found that 29 per cent of the lowest probability of death was in the 15 years period when compared with a group that had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not appear to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging to people with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
"The results of the investigations are crucial precisely in showing that the operation is safe for the lower mass index group", and it does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their physicians should take weight very seriously at the time the patient has BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"All cannot come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is from the Middle East.
The leader of Tibet’s Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees’ countries of origin.
Dalai Lama discussed the current refugee crisis in his speech, which he addressed at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford at the beginning of his ten - day visit to Britain. The centre is dedicated to ethics research.
Dalai Lama claimed that, in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put before individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it was also insufficient.
"All can't come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to consider long-term solutions: how real peace and real development can be brought to these Muslims, mainly through education and training.
The bottom line is to wonder how we can reduce killing in their own countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
Use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
In his view of the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the activities of George Bush following the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response from the United States led to violent events in the chain.
"After the 11th session, I presented my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem was found through the inviolence of violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used strength and it created unexpected consequences", Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, the swallowing of the child’s hand-infining substance has increased four times four times in the last four years.
The United States has reported an increase of nearly 400 % in the absorption of a highly alcoholic manual in children below the age of 12 years after 2010, reports Georgia’s poisoning Information Centre.
According to Gaylord Lopez, the director of Georgia’s Poison Information Centre, the case of the disinfectant in children below 12 years of age was raised from 3266 in the 2010 3266 case to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will have to go to the emergency department", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant for a purpose, while some want to impress their friends or meet the challenge of social media.
YouTube has videos in which teenagers drink disinfectant in order to get a low level of weight gain.
According to the reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant in alcoholic oral water to obtain a stronger drink.
A good disinfectant smells can attract younger children.
"The kid doesn't think it's bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (hands) are those with added smell.
There are lactose, grape and orange-based disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The disinfectant of the hand may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95% of any alcohol.
Especially in small children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol", Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 to Kansas City, the director of the Medical Information Centre for the Prevention of Diseases in the University of Kansas.
So you wouldn't leave whiskey on the table, but the hand-infectant is visible, and if the children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Oh, yes, Russell is a six-year-old girl who, for a while, swallowed only four injections from the manicuries hand disinfectant at school, and was taken to emergency care.
His blood alcohol levels were .179, which is twice the limit of the adult wheelchair drinking, reports first aid doctor Chris Ritchey, who was treating the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Oh, yeah, when you were talking about yourself, and you couldn't walk when he arrived at the first aid.
Doctors followed him in a hospital of children over the night for possible brain injury, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary", Nhaijah's mother Ortoria Scott said to CNN.
The situation could have been deadly to my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are combined with deaths.
In 2013, two Italian women died from swallowing their hands with disinfectant containing toxic, unannotable ingredient.
The health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and no ethyl alcohol reported as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourth graders planned to poison their "good" teacher by spreading bacterial poison to the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand disinfectant and denied it for his class.
The police have to prevent the plan of a "rolling up" and leave disciplinary action to the school circuit.
Word: There are no conflicts in Celtic: no conflicts on Celtic.
Griffiths will be short of talks about the conflicts in Celtic, and Deila admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but he can turn it around.
Hearts is fighting Scotland's football League against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is guarding the January recruits, which may interfere with the unity of the team with the unity of the team.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic at five points in five points.
The first half sentence shot by Adam Rooney took Aberdeen to a narrow victory at the Pittodre Stadium from Hamilton and gave the team the opportunity to raise the gap between Celtic to five points.
The Griffiths are calling on the conflict from one of the contradictions.
There have been rumors about the internal conflicts in Celtic, but Griffiths immediately passed them. He claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under more precise eye-to-face when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting for the encounter.
The lack of a Scottish championship to bore the Dutch - de Boer - de Boerer
The former Rangers middle-field player and former Dutch national football player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition from the championship with Rangers.
The current Ambassador de Boer of Ajax said: "The Netherlands no longer shows the highlight of the Celt games, and why?"
Because the Rangers are not involved.
People around here just can't talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
The games of these teams have a lot of excitement, and also non-Scotlands want to watch them play.
Deila swears that he will turn things around around around around the situation.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss is sworn to turn the situation around.
To destroy Malmölle and the resulting peaks of the Masters' league quickly resulted in a loss of ten men to play Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series by five points apart from the next one.
Deila said, however, "Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We are, too, but we have to keep going.
Indeed, we need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is equipped with reserves from January’s player transfers from January to January.
While the Rangers-pomo Mark Warburton just a few weeks ago commented on possible January players' points of play, he is alert to recruiting the most convincingly convinced that he does not want to confuse the team with consensus.
The former Brentford boss said, "The January transfer window is very different from that of the summer window."
For future players in the summer, the adjustment period is the pre-existing period, which appears in our team this season.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes increasing unnecessary players can make you more trouble.
The interest in Celtic's interest in Michu's point of reference to retirement is a reference to the way in which it is left to live.
The Swansea attacker, Michu, whose name is attached to the transfer window in Celtic, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans is over.
A 29-year-old player has had ankles for two years and has failed to find a new company outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight against the Scotland football Union because of Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2 after this. The defender's red card was revoked later, and this was the third red card condemned by Collum during the last eight months, which was cancelled.
He stayed behind and said, "I didn't question honesty, I didn't comment on performance."
The Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastlea.
The faithful Hibernian player became a nuisance since he accepted a offensive song about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before Edinburgh's derbya Tynecastle stadium in March 2014.
"There was a derby and it was a moment of thought", the attacker said, "It's too safe to say I'm not coming back to Tynecastle, unless I go on to play with Celtic."
Tanndice's government believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly Donnelly - Donnelly.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United Government still has the power to believe in management teams the ability to reverse the situation, but admit that the deterioration of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
Mcines is happy to be "a ugly victory" in the Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accisia, but it succeeded in reaching their seventh consecutive league victory, which raised them to the top of the table five points above Celticia.
McInnes says, "There is no team that has won anything, whether it's a cup or a league that would not have won any games in this way."
Scottish unemployment continues to remain the same with the increase in the UK's total population growth in the UK's size growth in the United Kingdom's size.
EMPLOYMENT IN Scotland, 164 000 people remained in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the United Kingdom increased by 10 000 people totalling 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the United Kingdom 5.5 per cent, the National Statistical Centre (ONS) figures are shown.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12 000 people over the three-month period and the number of employed persons is now 2,612,000.
The employment rate of Scotland decreased by 74 per cent over the quarter, which is higher than the average of the United Kingdom by 73.5 per cent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest figures: "The long-term government plan is to build the foundation for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to stay as part of the United Kingdom.
Over the last 12 months, Scotland's labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I testify to the execution of Oklahoma in Oklahoma, Oklahomamaa, Oklahomamaa, Oklahoma, Oklahomamaa, Oklahomamaa, Finland,
If there is no legal intervention, I will see later today when a man is executed.
If so, and I hope I don't, I'll sit on the viewer page at Oklahoma State Penitentiary to watch Richard Glossip be executed with a deadly injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've been starting to be a bitch this day when I'm approaching it.
So why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
For suppliers, of course, it is possible to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants are selected through horrific values.
The Oklahoma has reduced the places reserved for the media twelve to five.
Whoever they choose, they watch the event cool.
I can't do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also created my own contacts with him through monthly calls and a two- and a half-hour visit.
I like him.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and pen with me to record what I see.
I just need to try to remember all the details.
On Twitter, a cardinal reporter accused me of being objective about my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner the story he wanted, and you'll be able to participate.
I chose the supplier.
He admitted that "may have been better", but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what I'm supposed to write, and I wouldn't do that even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants us to have an international supplier who writes about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware is right next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I can't go through all the details here again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, he would do everything he could to help the guilty.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he will not commit murder.
I'm sure there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And this is the perspective I'm looking at that guy dying from.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
There will be other suppliers who will take care of it.
I'll give you a picture of how it feels to watch the man I like dies unnecessaryly.
The man was lured out of the Canning River River after he was pulled after the police station.
The Canning Valen officer remained dry when he lured him out of the Canning River River River River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to mislead the police from his cans went wrong when he found himself in a low, muddrum just a few feet from a policeman who tried to "fly him back on the beach".
The Canning Valen police were invited to Beckenham on Tuesday because of the illegal invasion of Beckenham.
When they found the suspect, he tried to mislead them by heading to the Canning River River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He stood in the water, saying, 'I'm not coming out, come for me,' said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to grow up, so he used safer tactics: "a good police negotiation".
"Some people do funny things trying to escape," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Master footballer Ben Cousins is an outstanding example.
In 2006 Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the outbreak and tried to swim across the Swan River River.
He did not succeed in his company, but inspired the locals to start with the playful Ben Cousins-biathlon design.
Peter Moody claims that operators tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's agents have tried to force their trust in his deposits last year, and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames the operators and the Racing Victoria section for claiming that they have a personal campaign running against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment taken on the day of the race was the last thread.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his aim has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation since the inexplicable positive coblic sample of Lidar.
He's been on his tongue for a year and a half with regard to spy claims, and he didn't want it to look like "it's jealous."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes it's getting so frustrated that everything's gonna go off one time", Moody said.
They knew that the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go head-to-head, and I want owners to think that I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don't have to go on as coach anymore.
Then I should consider what I do with my license.
In the past, Moody dropped the bomb on a racing.com site interview where he told me that the infertility department had tried to spy on his stables.
"Wonder years ago Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man... I named him when he asked me... and offered him a job at my depository if he cared about what I was doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they'd really want to break up with their lawyer because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, the current president of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all clear at that time and are clear about it today.
Should I begin to think that this is becoming personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to take a man up and perhaps transfer responsibility to other people than Coaches about what's happening in the field?
Am I harmful to the sector?
I'm so harmful to the sector?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I'm not at all sure that I'm not sure now that the things that I'm saying might make them think about exactly what they're thinking about.
But I'm at the point right now that I don't care anymore, and it's gonna upset me.
I'm really worried about you.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the coach has grown with the long-term Laddar cobolt research, and late rejection has led him to find that he could "save his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for the training of the undefeated master Black Caviar, has called for the rule of day-to-day care measures to be "stamped" after the mud or clay bite has been placed on the horse's feet, which is irregular.
"It's against competition rules.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees, in a mistake, has set it on its feet.
It could have been a shark last night.
It could have been yesterday, just like it was.
It was on the day of the race.
There may be a three-month competitive ban on Moody because of the day-to-day procurement treatment from which the operators started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"All of us understand that rules are necessary, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
In the Com, a driver who was guilty of a road load on the road was arrested in detention by a driver who was guilty of an accident in detention on the Com while on the road on the road in
The police have arrested a man who was involved in a road crash after he ran into a biker on the weekend in Cobram.
The biker was transported to the Royal Melbourne Hospital hospital after he had severe injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported herself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in the event of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobra, is still in hospital and his condition is stable.
Coach Craig Bellamy, coach of the Melbourne Storm team, is attacking competitors in a pre-eminence position.
The Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRL-rugbylig masters' claims that his team's jackets are part of the "line".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the divorceors allowed Storm 's press' on their own side when it suddenly won the final box in Sydney on Friday night.
The British Broncos coach Wayne Bennett could barely cover up his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the finals. Bennett invited the game to the rugbyligan's "screen screen" and said that two of the Queensland Teams were not "well excited" buttons.
Bellamy was defending the jackets of his team and said that they were just focusing on "Contact" in the jacket.
Bellamy added that his trust increased the two leading coach's criticism of Storm, because that means that they're afraid to lose to the team.
"This is always going to be a talk-- I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about pushing when we lost them 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or technologies throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have only stressed the contact with the tabloids, and it has made us succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he clearly has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, and that was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy appealed to Bennett's idea of "flexible rugby" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's coaching St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "just so."
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said that he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play rugby that we think is exciting, especially when he's got fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have the type of players you have.
He brought it up on the side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt in order to play like that.
I will be more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more focused than the game played between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more than that, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense in breach of the line of defense and the failure to do paint?
This is about the guidelines for me.
If they mention us, it means that somewhere we can play against them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game either against the North Queensland Cowboys or against the Cronulla Sharks and next Saturday night's pre-final in AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
Serbimeh's 200 000 dollars guarantee of drug charges.
A man who is threatened by the possible life-long possession of 40 cocaine kilograms smuggled into Queensland has been released against a guarantee of 200 000 dollars.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of five men who was arrested last month after the Federal Police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay yacht, which came to South America through the Old Age and was shipyardd in August to come to Comebera.
Maximovic was seen meeting other defendants on a boat all morning, and then he met them at the Coomer Roadhouse cafe where the police found 40 kilos of drugs in the Tokyo Echo car.
While Maximovich is threatening the possible amount of cocaine held in a life-long business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maksimovic tried to hold the entire amount, and that he could have been in a coffee shop for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has solid connections to Serbia.
She travels to Serbia frequently", she told me about her right Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal court, Maximovic lied to the police about the place he lived in.
Together, Maximovic's mother and stepmother offered a guarantee of $ 200,000 to ensure his release.
"As we read both persons' voluntary testimony, it is clear that setting up a 200 000 guarantee amount is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But alone it was not enough to prevent him not being brought to justice, he warned me not to appear in court.
The maximum guarantee was granted to Maximovic on condition that he gives up his passport to Australia and Serbia every day, informs the police and keeps track of his exit ban between 6:00 and 6:00 in the morning.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures.
He used a 11-year-old girl's phone when she asked for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl while sleeping on this phone and then logged in to the e-mail service, where Hogg received a large number of unsolicited pictures of children who were sent to her by another user.
The girl woke up later, discovered that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
She looked up her phone and found shocking messages, and then she immediately told her mother about it.
When the police arrived, the police saw five photos, looked into the computers on the scene and found "superious" online search boxes used to search for children's unscathed images.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to "intimidating pedophiles" on the Internet before he "in order to be a cop to scare them."
The Fiscal depute representative Eilith Robertson told the Dundeen Sheriff's Court of Justice: "He said that it was an addition - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had performed the graves on the computer but said they were only done because he wanted to pretend he was a cop so he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with the unknown person who sent him the pictures, and about the fact that Hogg asked him to send him additional pictures.
Hogg said he did this just for bait purposes.
He said after he got drunk, he's sick, and he wants to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added, "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, she was shaking and crying.
Mom saw the unruly pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
She was interviewed, and he told me that the defendant had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than him.
Hogg, a 23-year-old resident at Ward Road in Dunde, admitted that he was guilty of prosecution of the production or taking of images of unbroken children on the 14th day of June last year. He violated his guarantee on 25 January of this year and refused to be heard on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be identified as a sex offender's record because it can be said that his crimes did not include "a significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal suspended the judgment in October so that social measures have time to prepare background reports.
Hogg has been granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he is under arrest before the hearing.
He was added to a sex offender's register before the day of his conviction.
Mr Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech to the House.
In the past year, Africa's senior leader Mugabe fell on the stairs leading up to the speaking age.
He was not injured, but the video of the fall spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament's opening arguments were also based on the opposition's legislators' arguments that they had been sent anonymous threats of killing, in which they were warned not to let Mugabe know during his speech.
In the last month, they talked to him and interrupted him in mid-terms while keeping his speech on the state of the country to Parliament - which he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group leader Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages to their mobile phones which warned them not to interfere with Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not respond, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The communication warned the relevant members that immunity would end in Parliament, and when they came out, parliamentary immunity would not be in force.
The group criminal supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is 'mainten' about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and operating efforts in the business of business services.
Later this year, HP is divided into two listed companies, separated from the growing enterprise hardware and service activities of their computer and print business.
The expected job cuts involve costs of about 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, according to HP's report.
"These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", Meg Whitman, HP President and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the current HPA, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our opportunity to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be over 50 billion dollars, and it "focuss on producing comparisons with integrated technology solutions" for companies, reports the company's information.
The division will break down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from Stanford University, set up in the 1930s to manufacture electrical equipment.
HP has been through a huge restructuring process to cope with the transition from traditional computer to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest US technology companies, and its distribution is in the latest field, which is based on the belief that strictly limited companies are doing better.
Arsena’s Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's game with the game between Dinamo Zagreb and Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now and assuming that his rehabilitation is scheduled, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this case, however, at least four of the next English games will be missed by Wilshir, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be participating in the European Championships next summer.
The greatest pity for this most recent problem is that Wilsherer's end of the last period was strong after an individual vertebrae, and he remembered his old steel before the beginning of the season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's not weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or past injuries that he's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as Weninger also admitted, when trying to get back through the process, there is always a risk of additional injuries.
There is also an uncomfortable model for the design process.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years he has played Arsenal 157 games only in 65 games.
For the purposes of view of Arsenal's wider overall population after the period 2007-08, for six seasons of eight, it has been one of the selected teams that have lost the most days due to injury.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of a witch show, but Arsenal believes that their improvement in the injury statistics will continue in the last period.
"The ability to recover from the injury could be a vulnerable period, when the body needs to be strengthened and the competition acquired", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will stabilise, I am sure that it will happen and that he will make a career that he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his Master's league game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing on Saturday after Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspurer.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be at the beginning of the operation.
Wenger may also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in the holding of Nacho Monrelin and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep balance and give a breath to the needy players," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal has a clear follow-up to the F-block, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is the scariest in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 matches since they produced their own "Insolent" campaign last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was surrounded by an earthquake, which had a power of 3,2 on Richter's scale.
It was the tenth of Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned about the surrender of the Masters' league against Monaco, and he is still motivated by a distant dream leading the team to its first victory at the European Cup.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I know how to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not wounds.
FriendsFest: Comemedia series that taught us serious things about friendship between men and about friendship between men.
It is striking how similar images are not in categories, especially given the need for men to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 years in Britain and is three times more common in men than in women.
In the company, Campaign Agaiinst Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
According to the study, the possibility of a person to recover doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends was "well pleased".
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental health problems was halved if they were happy to have healthy friends.
But in order for friendship to work, it must be available first.
Through this social media communication time style goes past content, and the immediateness of the reply is often more important than contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even though isolation really controls.
The values that psychologists call external values of this partial success are the social status of money, image, and social status. All of this happens at the cost of personal growth and friendship of internal values, which are more profoundly affecting our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not get more happiness.
The fine thing about French was that it turned this focus on its head.
No figure was defined by their work, but rather by their personality, which was clearly separated from interaction as friends.
The numerous hugs of Joey and Chandler, in the moments of nice chairs I watch football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor became aware that yes, men can agree with all this, even though they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As a volunteer worker of the Samaritans explained to me: ..."When listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have truly understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can make you feel better."
Men contact us often feel that you can't talk to friends.
The old idea of "crossing over" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up problems, you can see weak.
French is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival methods.
It brought up the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone helps people at times of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends' network.
And then if you participate in Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the venues are redesigned for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to a coffee in Central Perki?
Or what's better if you see someone lonely, smile and say hello in Starbucks.
You never know how much friendship you can mean.
The French will be sent to Comedy Central from the end of the Comedy Central, all 236 episodes, participate in #FridsFest.
Di Maria paints and helps PSG to heat Malmo's side of Malmo's side of Malmo's.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against the paintings of Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored the Master's league debut in his debut, helping PSG to pass the Swedish team on Tuesday in Malmo.
Under the match report and the reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain started his Master's league game with a nice 2-0 victory against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Master's league debut in her goal for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French leagues, but the team lost several chances before finally added their way to Cavan's attack with 61 minutes of paint.
A partner in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk needed a strong start against the Swedish league, because the game was not only a destination, but also an improvement in their quarter-final leading games during the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, because Laurent Blanc's team Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the place in front of the goal and later was replaced from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and that team where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It is not easy for masters to win at home or in guests, so the 2-0 victory produces problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and is a good start, even though there are things that we have to make this season sand", Blanc said.
This is good foresight.
We wanted to win and win, even though I don't think we managed to make one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris Team one of the three changes made since the team remained 2-2 in Ligue 1's home game against Bordeaux on the weekend, but he stayed in the fourth minute at Di Maria's shadow.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, an Argentinian tailor was named a man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he ran off to Marco Verratt's bait behind Malmö's defense line and then hit a beautiful finishing past Johan Wiland in the back corner of the network.
However, if anyone expected PSG to make a simple and big win, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a smug opponent. It won at Celtic's settlement when he reached this level, its opening range is nine international players and five-man defenses, and two players in a deep middle field.
But the team didn't offer much more than Nikola Djordjic's shot on the side of the attack in the 34th minutes, which passed through Kevin Trapp's goal end.
On the other hand, the PSG occurred sometimes because of lost input and poor finalisation, in particular from Ibrahimovic, which failed in five companies only during the first half of the period and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball inside of Ibrahimovic’s contact at the beginning of the second half of the second half.
However, he was much more effective at doing his pre-work for his colleagues, and it was just from Ibrahimovic's bait Di Maria who sent off for a roll shot, which went up the Wland goal end around 52 minutes.
One goal was eventually reached after an hour of the game after the sixth goal of his season, thanks to Cavan by the year after Ibrahimovic had pulled over Maxwell's crucifix from the left.
It ended with Malmö's wishes to get back to the game, and only Wiland's excellent fight against David Luis' direct kick was kept the final numbers down before the exchange of Ezequiel Lavizz's goal was abandoned at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was as high as his team. Norwegian said: "The last game of the Masters' league was last December."
Since then, we have only played Sweden's league, which is not the same level.
There's not enough scratch matches.
I'll get the hat to Paris.
This was a great game for them.
Glencore collects $2.5 billion at the sale of shares.
The mining sector in Switzerland left Glencore, which suffered a price deterioration of basic goods, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its extensive debt relief plan.
Glencore, who was listed in the London Stock Exchange, announced in the notice that it had sold new shares for about GBP 1.6 billion to shorten its debts.
A company that lost 57 % of its market value this year is struggling with prices of collapsed basic goods, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is causing demand and causing destruction in all markets.
The label was used to mark the value of Glencore's shares at the top of the London Stock Exchange in mid-week morning shopping.
The shares rose by 2.77% to 131,60 per cent in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up by 0.69 per cent higher than in the FTSE 100 index.
Glencore had revealed last week as part of a 2.5 billion dollar stock trade, its broader plan to cut its 30 billion dollars debt burden by about a third of its debt burden.
The company sold new equity capital at 125pps, which meant a reduction of 2.4 per cent on Tuesday at the final price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, totalling 9.99 per cent of the company's share.
As a result, the long-lasting post of Chinese growth has cut the prices of iron ore by about half, and at the same time prices of coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40 per cent.
The White White White House confirms Xi Jining's visit to Washington to Washington, Washington, Washington.
China President Xi Jinping makes public visits to the United States at the end of the month, the White House's opinion published on Tuesday was confirmed.
The first official visit of Xin to Washington takes place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's last November Beijing visit, said the opinion.
The President of the United States and the spouse of the President, Michelle Obama, will host a dinner for Xille and his spouse Peng Liyuan after the leaders have held bilateral negotiations.
"The visit by Ms X will enable us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common common interest, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively the issues where there are differences" was added in the resolution.
The visit, which was announced for the first time in February, Xin is also expected to depart in Seattle on his way to Washington to meet a large number of U.S. leaders before he continues towards New York City and the UN September Assembly.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged network surveillance and the increased absoluteity of the country in southern China's controversial waters of the sea.
Matt Damon reduces the diversity of film in filmmaking.
Matt Damon brought together an African-American filmmaker, Effie Brown, when they were discussing the differences that Damon said were not needed behind the scenes.
The actor who was experienced in the HBO Sunday evening's Project Light section interrupted Brown's emphasis on the need for different perspectives regarding the selected script of the project to be a dark person with the darkest head character in the script.
"When we talk about diversity, it is taken into account when choosing actors for the movie, not the show," Damon claimed.
The alarmed Brown reacted unbelievably, with comments on "Oho! Wow. Okay" while the comments of the actor The Martian were hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finals of the series.
"I want to encourage people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony's personal character," Brown said to begin with.
The only dark figure is a whore that his white pimp beats.
The Dear White People producer demanded the rights to direct the film to finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon firmly replied that their direction "may end up giving us something we don't want to do.
After the debate, social media blew up Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPoni expressed his anger at the film play by writing: "Matt Damon talking about the only dark-haired person in the room and explaining to him the difference between being a NITHER BECAUSE it hurts."
After the publication, the quote collected more than 5,000 retwices and 4,000 movies.
Damon's comments are at a time when an accurate racial presentation on the media is in the interest of social discussion.
After the white police killed a teenager named Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread out abroad and called on the legislators and the authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, the singer, Prince, referred to the issue in his presentation of the Year's album as the winner of the Grammy Prize.
"Album still matters," he said.
As with books and black livings, albums still matter.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement recently published an opinion to answer the question of whether a group should be regarded as an angry group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was only said that Damon is involved in it among entertainers, producers and media modules invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted an invitation or has already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion, crowned first American Ninja Warrior.
On Monday, Isac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition and won the prize of a million dollars.
The seven-year competition programme has never had a competitor who would have cleared all the contributions of the programme's obstacle track.
In the last section of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten survived the last round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 23 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and figured out the challenge in time, which allowed him to become the first athlete of all time to discover the exhausting 4th episode of American Ninja Warren. Caldiero, however, discovered the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero gave an interview with E!News after a difficult win and was still shocked to win a million dollars prize.
"It's great to think about it when I've never earned or lived less than $100,000 a year," Isaac told E after his big raise.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Production Director Kent Weed stopped to discuss with The Hollywood Reporter the calendar list and why Britten does not receive any more reward, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person in the world.
"If more people pass, the money gets the fastest time," Weed said.
Although money is a great prize and a change of life, he still gets a great sense of satisfaction.
I don't think that's why she's feeling a grudge.
He's just so happy that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family man.
He is the hero of his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone was supposed to win me, I'm happy it was Isaac."
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had gone the other way around.
American Ninja Morris will return to the eighth season, whose descriptions will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers ski past the Twins of Minnesota by the Twins.
The second half of the season has not been very funny to Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now is the last American League Central division.
Tigers played his role perfectly on Tuesday, when he won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins missed the opportunity to get up in the game-side head from Houston Astros in a competition from another American League wild card place.
The game for Detroit was at least one night a return to the six-word H-word, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the second half of the period.
"All profits are fun, regardless of how they are made," said Brad Aumus, the team leader of Tigers.
The Tigers' entrant Alfredo Simon continued his early attack aid when Detroit was running three times in the first two pairs, and then once again in the sixth and second in the ninth grade.
Simon (13-9) threw 6 1/3 in the bar and saved three runs.
This was just his third match of quality in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for a man to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
The Tiger deputy Victor Martinez hit three times and enabled two runs that were his first hit after August.
This was Martinez's first three hit night after he hit four against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
"He's sneezing well," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in play exercises), seemed significantly better in play exercises and continued to do the same in the game.
The Twins were three running in the second half of the seventh pair, and that was their best chance of getting back to the game.
Sent Byron Buxton started his shift by hitting twice out on the left-hand sideline.
On the right side, Aaron Hicks settled in one nest with a tie, and Simon got burned directly by another nest player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with a left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against him, the pre-starting replacement player Miguel Sana, who beat the two nests off from Drew VerHagen's right-hand side.
With the two runners on the field and a levelling runner on second base, VerHagen was given a three-pee Trevor Plouffen to hit a double-game leading painting.
It was a record of the main series: 27 times this season, when Plouffe hit a double.
Since Detroit had received backup at the ninth start of the race, Mauer threw two punches at the Tiger sealer against Bruce Rondonia, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right player burned Sano in three baits in his fifth rescue.
The Detroit used Phil Hughes in the rusty at the beginning.
Tigers was able to run three in the first two pairs against a right-hand veteran player who got out of the injured list before the game was out after more than a month of infection with the lower leg of the lower leg.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start like this", Hughes said, "but when the game came up, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I was able to make a third round with a couple of nice inputs."
After Hughes caught the first nest of the beginner, he gave the second base player Ian Kinsler to move forward one by one.
On the right side of J.D. Martinez's walk in two pieces in the situation led Victor Martinez to take his turn, which took himself to the first stop on the middle field line and caused the first race of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipeline with the runners in good running positions.
A third-party player, Nick Castellanos, continued by hitting the right and by causing another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected by him trying to move to the third base.
Tigers continued on the second pair and received one piece, a two-queathed kidnapper from James McCann and two pieces from one seat to the other, and then the situation was 3-0.
"It was an important shot", Paul Molitor, the team leader of Twins, said.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feed locks and fed an impoverished third shifter, and then he became the right-hand extension of A.J. Achter.
Hughes was calculated as three runs from six hits and a walk in four pieces.
NOTE: Tigers' right-hand feeder Anibal Sanchez had to get rid of his shoulder for a twitching.
He was investigated by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-September because of a shoulder-stick, but she had to come back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, the left-handed feeder Daniel Norris comes from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are on 1-1 to 4 on the initiative after the left-hand feeder David Price was replaced with David Price on 30 July.
Norris has been out since 20 August because of the thinness of the real toad muscle.
The series of Tigers and Twins three games ends on Wednesday at the Target Field field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 EERA) is placed against the real-right bait Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 EERA).
Xi urges the world to open the world to the world in a wider global economy.
The economy should be helped more to the outside world in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to steer reform.
"Who should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing transparency policy," he said in his speech at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to the deepening of the reform.
Support for transparency at the same time as reforms are driving forward more new movement and vitality, as well as create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Group adopted a series of guidelines including a negative list of market access restrictions, a lack of border control principles, a call for state-owned companies to apply to private capital, and a revision of the housing registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list of sectors and companies that cannot be invested is created.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through experimental programmes.
This change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in targeting resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more transparent, the opinion states.
The government will also loosen its management into the power it distributes to companies, thereby ensuring that the companies themselves decide how to manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China should allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation as well as new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
In order to open up government-led sectors to private donors, more sectors are being opened up.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legal interests of companies financed by foreigners and provide them with better services," said the opinion.
In addition, the search process will be facilitated by optimising the requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the provision of professional qualifications rights and support for trade unions and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and by senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, a statement published after the meeting.
