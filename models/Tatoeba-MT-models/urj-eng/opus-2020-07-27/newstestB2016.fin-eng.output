Ronaldo again in a fessy - ripped the paint between Messin and Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals at the Spanish league weekend and continued its factory at the Masters' league as well.
The struggle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo from the Magistrate of the Master's league turned to the latter for at least a moment.
Real Madrid Ronaldo moved alone to the top of all-time goal-makers statistics when he shot a visitor in the Shahtar Donetsk network with two shots of punishments and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his painting to 80 when, before Tuesday, before Tuesday with him, he was standing with the Barcelona Messiah with 77 matches.

Juventus has been in the Italian football league at Serie A since the beginning, but in the D-section of the Master's league, it began with a two-to-one guest gain from Manchester City.
The victory was done by over ten minutes before the end of Juvenus Alva Morata.
From the city attack, the absence of Sergei Aguero, the knee leprosy, bored the absence of the knee lemurs.
Aguero came to the field only the last ten minutes of the day, who was injured in the election match on the weekend.
Also, the second Manchester Society, United, experienced hard in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering from 1-2 losses.
The 20-year-old ManU's visit to Luke Shaw will only take a quarter of an hour.
The dangerous-looking slide suit of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the paint on the manU package that was attacked so badly that Shaw was likely to break his leg.
Shaw was lying at Eindhoven's home stadium tens of minutes before the medical staff left to drive him to hospital.
Memphis Depay took guests 41 minutes to a 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno made up for extra rest.
In the second half of the year, Luciano Narsingh made a profit for the PSV.
In the league of the Masters of the Agriculture season, the A-block started with Paris Saint-Germain.
There was an Argentinian Angel Di Maria who changed the PSG for Manchester United's shirt.
Di Maria broke through the right and picked up the back of the ball by Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made the second half of PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been taken over among the successes of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which belongs to the league's lengths, is not the best possible benchmark destination.
For the first time, the star-seeker of the PSG Zlatan Ibrahimovic met Malmö FF his professional career for the first time.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.

The opposition's opposition party demanded immediate separation - the president gave the wrong speech.
Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe has once again held the same speech in the country's parliament that he held at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not realize, during his 25-minute speech, that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether a 91-year-old Mugabe is in full life's power.
The MDC has asked Mugabe to resign from his duties because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed in to say that the confusion had just happened in Mugabe's board and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech discussed earlier and now the impact of China on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis in Germany and Austria for an additional summit on the refugee crisis.
next week, Germany and Austria have presented an additional EU-led summit of EU leaders due to the refugee crisis.
The European Council President Donald Tusk will assess the request.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how Europe can be more effectively registered.
The negotiations on the allocations for asylum seekers are made by Merkel on the table of the Minister for the Interior.
In an emergency call, a professor admitted that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked for a voice in an emergency call to give a little bit of an emergency call to the police at home and told me that he had shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their dear dog was there and alive and probably scared. Professor told me that the contact information of a dead woman’s family would be on her phone.
The police inside the house found the body of Amy Prentiss and the white paper handwritten by hand: "I am very sorry and I hope that I could cancel my actions. I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me", Lambin signed by the authorities.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 500 kilometers to a school campus.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford found out that the university official received information about shooting at 10.18 in the morning.
According to him, Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while after this time.
One more death occurred today, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The next day, students and teaching staff kept their vision behind locked doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motives.
The researchers were able to find out details on both locations, and Lamb's well-known teachers told me about the man. The researchers were created with a picture of a talented but perhaps a problem teacher.
Students always said they were eager to wait for the professor's hours.
According to the Gauter police of Prentis's death scene, the professor had no history of violence or crime.
Schmidt had mentioned in his book Lamb, which had given recognition to "the faithful people" with whom he was able to spend his academic life with.
Both work at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which included 17 staff. Many of the students took part in the courses of both men and women.
However, references to problems arise.
The Lambia-tudy student, Brandon Beavers, told me that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if he had something wrong with him.
Another student, Mikkel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about his stress at the end of the academic year 2014-2015.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a sickness leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university salary policy meant that the argument for which Lamb had worked hard did not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
Professor William LaForge of the University told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lambia was clearly troubled by something.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After leaving the campus, the police found out which route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississip.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life with a 38-caliber pistol in the back of the house in Mississippi Greenville, about a half a mile from his parents' home, medical examiner Methel Johnson, D.C., told methel Johnson.
The Lamb's car was still on the road.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told me that he believed that the man knew the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started his work as a science and educational teacher at a university with 3 500 students. The city had 12 000 inhabitants in 2009 .
In the spring he was awarded a doctorate in educational science.
One of the longest friends in Lamb's life pictured this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that he met Lamb through his mutual friends when he was 15 and Lamb 20 years old.
He was still with his friends in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried years to teach Harston about guitar playing.
"The lamp was quite a heart-breaker at that time.
All the girls were on him," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for a while.
At the wedding, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but according to any document they had not been married.
Some had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brickhouse in a river park in Gauter's small town.
According to the police, the dog was fine.
Prentiss' former husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he resigned from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they had a daughter who is now 19.
"He was very upset", O'Steen said about his daughter.
"Dary and Mom were the best friends."
O'Steen had never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both showed up at a summer event three years ago.
Later, they used to call together.
According to O'Steen, his daughter writes and plays her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bar and part-time entertainment coordinator outside Gauter, U.S.A., told me that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on 5 September when Lamb had called guitar and lips for a few audience.
Nothing told me that something was wrong.
Happy couple, Shaffer said.
"We were together together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who received his death, directed the first year of seminars and was specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times", the English professor Don Allan Mitchell told me.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was chairman of his own brotherhood and college.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, there were 900 people who met at the Memorial at the candlelight. Among them were school staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife, Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt, also attended the night event where the university choir presented the paragraphs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
The teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report Mississippi from Cleveland.
Journalists: Associated Press editors Emily Wagner Pettus Mississippi in Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected because the police are now telling us that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also specified that although Lamb referred to her wife in an emergency call to Prentis as her wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers.
However, the dealer of toys and babies' products tells us that he is currently offering employees and seasonal workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people for shops and distribution centres across the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.

Michael J. Fox is having a joke with Princess Diana about her "t date" Princess Diana.
Back to the first night of the New Year's film, Michael J. Foxy was a significant moment for his career.
First night also had personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royal arrival. I noticed there was an empty place next to me. I was told that Princess Diana was coming by my side", Fox told me that she would come in at the trailer of the Back in Time document.
"When the movie began, I realized that the situation reminded me very much of a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time document is linked to Return to Future films, and the documents will be consulted in addition to Fox Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the future movie, he got his first night 30 years ago.
"This movie is definitely a time travel movie for me," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in VOD and DVD formats and will be presented in selected cinemas from October to October.
UN Secretary- Secretary- General: no military solution in Syria.
The UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military efforts and notes that there is no military solution to almost five years of conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban reported his intention to meet five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria. The meeting would take place later this month in connection with the Ministerial Week of the UN General Assembly held this month.
Ban regrets that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has caused a situation which is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate, in the context of the Syrian crisis, the same solidarity and unity that reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Chapter 8 of the support checker: Is Donald Trump serious?
The most powerful ones have been tried to stamp them as an empty talker.
He's also been considered a joke.
You know how to predict Trump's collapse.
The Republican circles have (to the extent of) the results have been sought in every way to pull Trump down from the galup chain.
Ten of the eleven national galups show Donald Trump two-digital figures, and some are already seriously considering what it actually tells about the conditions of the property mogul.
Although the elections are only during the early stages of the election.
Nothing has yet been declared to be a candidate for Republican Republicans.
Experts point out that, at this time in 2011, Rick Perry, who was in the galaxy, was able to give room to the rising Herman Cain. Neither of them finally won the candidate election in any state.
For many reasons, the Olympic would be difficult for the general elections.
External groupings, such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Financial Conservative Group Club for Growth, have noted Trump's strong position and started digging up their cuss to take him down.
The following recent galup data show that real estate modules cannot be ignored by means of an ossification:
There has been a complete translation in the favour of the Trump.
Just before Trump announced that he was a candidate in the middle of June, according to the Gallup at Monmouth University, only two of the ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogus.
By mid-July, already 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive vision of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures also hold states where elections are held first.
In last week's Quinni market gallup, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two of the third Republicans would be pleased with the Trump nomination.
In CNN and ORC galup last week, 67% of Republicans found themselves very satisfied or satisfied with the possible choice of Trump as candidates.
Only two out of ten would be extremely dissatisfied with the Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson makes almost as zealous reception as Trump (43% would be very pleased with Carson's nomination and 40% for Trump's candidate).
Who is next popular candidate?
Third, Marco Rubio, which has a corresponding contribution of 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or extremely dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected candidates for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider the Trump temperament to be problematic.
52% of Republicans' supporters worldwide view the properties of the real estate module as suitable for the president. The views are based on the opinion of ABC News and Washington Post.
The same reading applies to Iowa, where the first meeting is held: according to the Quinnic Market Gallery, 52 per cent of Republicans consider Trump's personal properties to be suitable for the Commander of Defence Forces.
However, according to ABC and Post's gallup, 44 per cent believe Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament incompatible with the White House.
Republicans are beginning to get used to the idea.
They're starting to be serious about Trump.
When asked by Republicans, who is most likely to be chosen as a party candidate, CNN and ORC gallu, four out of ten believe in Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have lost their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Total: Republicans have never had a very reliable crystal ball in their use before.
At this time, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
Most people seem to think the Trump campaign is convincing.
Even if Republicans supported another candidate, Trump covers almost all other candidates.
Part of the experts consider that the split camp is likely to benefit Trump when the opponents of the Trump split up with the beneficiaries of the different candidates.
At the beginning of September, Monmouth University's opinion revealed that in an imaginary double-defence between the Trump and almost any other Republican site, Trump would almost always have a greater share of its support.
He leads Cary Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasichia and Chris Christtie at 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's on levels.
Is Cruz Trump's only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take a win from Trump by 19 points apart from the imaginary two-killing.
A small majority of the supporters of the Trump say that they have already taken a vote.
According to the gallup published by CBS and the NYT on Tuesday, fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their voting decisions.
Of course, the situation may change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of the favorite beneficiaries have not taken a final decision.
At this very moment, the competition is a neurosurgeon, Ben Carson, but the voters who have already chosen their candidates will vote twice more likely to vote for the Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans share the Trump's vision of migration.
In his campaign speech called Donald Trump, migration from Mexico has been a hot topic for 2016.
It is a matter of concern that Trump's powerful speeches are deported by important Latin American voters from the Republicans and hinder brand renewal.
However, according to the opinion of ABC News and Washington Post published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are on the same line with Trump on migration issues.
As long as migration is on the bright side, so does Donald Trump.
The dissatisfaction of administration is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republicans' votes. A significant increase is the fact that both of them have come outside of office.
According to the latest opinion of ABC News and Washington Post, this opinion was of the Republicans of six out of ten.
These two candidates are also very hot for Washington.
According to the opinion made by Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the activities of Republicans in Congress: 54 per cent are dissatisfied and 21 per cent on the brink of rage."
Jeremy Corbyn debuted Prime Prime Prime Minister at Question Time at the Prime Minister's Question Time at the Prime Minister's Question Time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
After the election, Corbyn's first priority at the Prime Prime Prime Minister Question Time is expected to be delighted at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
The Labour Party Labour's new spin picture Jeremy Corbyn is due to rise for the first time in its failure to force David Cameron at Question Time later.
Corbyn presents his first six questions a little after midday. Press media and Labour Party representatives are following a man's eye hard.
Corby's been calling for less theater and more facts for the weekly show.
He has also found that he can skip part of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corby's leadership will be weighed for the first time in the context of the meeting. Corby will now be subject to a parliamentary test following his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the Labour Party to shut down at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War held during the national song on Tuesday has received criticism from several representatives of the Tory Party. The dispute has also reached the headlines of several newspapers.
Corbyn’s silence during the national song reached attention.
Corby's representative said that Corbyn would stand up during the national singing, while respecting the silence of the Sanctuary of the Royal Air Forces in the fight against Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, in the BBC Two's Newsnight programme, told us that the leader of the party would have called on the leader to join the National Song in spite of the opposition of this Monarchy.
The Kyminen Minister for Defence has refused to join Corby's unity and appeals to differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the party has originally supported Corbyn's election to the party.
Robin Brant, the writer of BBC's policy, considers that political differences between the British EU membership and the conditions for granting benefits to the Government have been accumulated in the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
At the TAC meeting, Corbyn said that Labour intends to propose amendments to remove restrictions in its entirety.
Hours later, Minister of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, Smith, stated that the party's position was very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to fall from 26,000 to 23,000 p.m.
Corby is the fifth Director of Labour, who David Cameron meets over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The Director-General of Labour, who promised a new approach to politics, says that he has chosen questions to Cameron from his audience on 30 000 proposals.
According to Corbyn, elected from the Islington North Electoral district, there are too many contacts at Question Time, and he promises to avoid clever terms and authorisations and he says he is focusing on serious issues, such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Corby has noted that the Minister of the Interior, Angela Eagle, is calling him on questionnaires, for example when Cameron is on a foreign journey abroad.
Corby has also set out the idea that others may also be able to vote at times, and he will speak to Mr Bericowin, President of Parliament's House on the subject.
After Corbyn reached a party meeting in 2005 Cameron stated that he wanted a doll theater policy that is often linked to the questionnaire, but some years later he admitted that he had failed his efforts.
Since the first time that Question Time was filmed in 1990, it has been seen as a key measure of the management's judgment, under-room management and position. However, according to the criticisms, the survey has become a kind of caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": from homeless to young photographers to homeless young photographers.
The downtown of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for the homeless.
A meaningful way to learn and make money has been found for the group of former Catholics.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit description studio that teaches homeless young people how to photograph their country of origin and earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young person who has been completed through a project among the first ones.

The Plain is strengthened by rising UK wages.
The snow was strengthened by rising wages in the United Kingdom, and SABMler drew the FTSE 100 index to an increase in the number of FTEs.
In May to July, wages in Great Britain rose by 2.9 per cent from the corresponding period of last year; no bonuses were calculated.
The faster growth than before was the fastest since the year 2009.
The weight was increased by 1%, and the rate was quoted at 1.5505 USD.The put was also confirmed in relation to the euro and quoted to EUR 1.3330.
The FTS 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and ended at 6.22.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course went down by 20 per cent when the company received the initial purchase offer from AB InBev, a competing company.
When it comes to trading, the two largest brewery companies in the world and others under the same roof would be brands, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent in the old water of the competing Richemont Group's positive result, which focuses on luxury products.
The most recent sales figures for Richemont are much better than expected. The development of sales was also the key market for Burberry in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent of the miner's declared intention to collect shares of USD 2.5 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Package and Paper Group Mont's shares were the largest drop of 4.3 per cent, when Goldman Sachs dropped the price of the company's shares for sale.
The JD Sports course rose by 3.1 per cent after the sporting company announced that its return before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to 46,6 million pounds.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could be detrimental to enlargement.
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of the JD Sports Board, a minimum wage increase in the UK would mean more purchasing power for potential customers in the United Kingdom.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, an increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash lanse against Ald's enersing by the grass-root campaign against Aldi's deportation.
Metcash is trying to secure his IGA store from the Aldi regime in South and West Australia.
Metcash has launched a grass-root campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retail stores in South and West Australia, Aldin USD 700 million against the invasion of Australia.
Aldi will open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands with marketing in power communications and social media, as well as organising events such as Adelaide show.
IGA stores and suppliers as well as many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory at Dunsborough offers corn in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to the customers at a discount price for the games of the South Australian football league.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade trap will hold an annual investment strategy date.
It is a significant market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of the footprint of Metcashin IGA stores, and in these areas the coverage is higher than in the IGA trade network of the Eastern States.
Southern and western consumers are known for their neighbourhoods, and IGA dealers have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and in Western Australia is 24%, while in the eastern state only 14% is in the East.
For example, Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two countries within 12 months of opening up first stores.
This week, Morgan Stanley’s analyst Tom Kierath estimates that the sale of IGA dealers could amount to 360 million and Metcash’s sale of 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The projections are based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 shops in South and West Australia next year and will reach USD 500 million and USD 600 million in these regions.
Metcash's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and sales may mean a loss of USD 13 million in the result before interest and taxes, Kierath states.
At the same time, Metcast loses its market share in eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although according to the recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA's customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and its market share would decrease from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the leading portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, told the event in Melbourne that it would be very likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to make a public statement to Douglas's comments.
It is understandable that the member of the Board of Metcashin contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and the profit of Metcash food business serving 1200 IGA resellers has decreased by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, the wholesale operator will take action and will make an annual cut of over $150 million in Australian dollars to meet Coles and Wolworth prices per hundred products per week. The company wants to support traders in the renewal of shops so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the commercial choice of own brands for food.
Mr. Metcash's CEO, Ian Morrice, stated that price revisions and reform plans for stores are in good speed and that the company will be able to raise its profits for the first time in 2017 for the first time for four years.
Steve Healy, president of the Australian tennis union, defends Thanasi Kokkinaki from Thanasi.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior rather than his particular criticism of the name.
According to Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis union, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a victim of recent Nick Kyrgios-related cases, and the chef deserves special status rather than criticism of special advertising.
Kokkinakis, one of the most popular parties named "Special K" called "Special K", became unfavorable when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament in Montreal.
Soon thereafter, in the cartel between Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had twice to separate the rivals. "Wawrinkan should have given his back to Kyrgios and my friend," Harrison said.
In the U.S. Open, Kokkinakis hit a frustrated mile field when the strong cramps ruined his fight. Hely has faithfully defended Kokkinakis.
At the moment, the teenager is in Glasgow, where he is fighting with Sam Groth about the second-time single-game-off behind Bernard Tonic in the semi-final of Davis Cup against the United Kingdom.
"I strongly believe that your Thanas has been drawn to the dispute," Healy said.
"He broke a bat when he lost the fight in the US open, and he's not the first player to break his land because of his frustration. I know Thanas so well that he's not so proud of what he does.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in U.S. openness, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a family of good men around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature at 19 years of age, he works hard and completes well with the team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he is respected among players. He practices hard, is in good condition and is a really stable and mature young man. I think he should be assessed on the basis of his own marines."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgios Australia's team from an important round, starting with the family, and Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties, but he is in favour of returning the Canberra breed to the team for a long-term confirmation of the team.
" First of all, we want to focus entirely on games instead of anything about Kyrgios", Healy said.
As Mr. Federer and Mr. Murray have pointed out, the youngster is forced to grow up in the light of the publicity. He deserves even the criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we sought to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to make his own peace, and I believe that it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants, arrests migrants.
Hungary declared that Hungary closed its southern border from Serbia on Tuesday and caught illegal migrants, with the intention of preventing the flow of migration.
There was chaos on the border when hundreds of immigrants were gathered in a non-kin country, and the Serbian authorities reacted fiercely.
People who escaped violence had to remain in their tents on road between inspection stations in countries for an unlimited period of time.
The breakup started to get up in the surface.
While the police officer was flying in the air above migrants, they "Open the border!" and shouted insults to Hungarian mellow police officers.
Part of the protest was about eating and drinking.
The Foreign Minister of Serbia announced that it did not accept that migrants would be sent back to Hungary at the same time as more came from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbi wants to be part of the solution, no added damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels and also in other countries", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The death at the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later when the 28-state grouping failed to develop a common migration policy at a dispute-based meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed, however, that the responsibility for the 40,000 flooding of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece was shared, with the hope that an agreement would be reached either next month or by the end of next year on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week in order to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not hope for immediate action by Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, an emergency occurred so that in the two southern regions the authorities were able to introduce more effective means of closing you down and speeding up the legal processes in the area of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto noted that Hungary also plans a cross-border aid for the Romanian border in order to prevent the flow of migratory flows from that direction, now that the Serbian border is ready to help.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even the prisoners took part in the tendering procedure for the finalisation of cross-border loans between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear pillar and a transit point for migrants to the European Union. Many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and from other parts of the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of incoming people are living refugees, not war refugees who have the right to seek security, but the view of the differences in the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary after midnight, it is a crime to cross or damage a cross-cold cross-sectional fence, which has been built by a government in the direction of Serbia along the southern border.
"Because of the situation caused by immigration, the government will declare a crisis situation in the country", the government editor Zoltan Kovacs told journalists about the city of Szeged in the south of the country.
"We follow a strict line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt military measures that are expected next week. The suppliers of the Associated Press News Office at the border have, for several days, seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs on the border.
Gyorgy Bákoni, adviser on the internal security of Orban, said that the authorities have taken over 45 borders to try immediately at the border and 15 further away.
Help harm the people who cross the border are now in the police's hands, and they are charged with crimes under new laws.
The authorities will make sure to help quickly.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two seven border crossing points at Serbia's border on Tuesday. One border crossing site was closed by a train covered with a cross-sectional train.
The chaos reached the main border crossing point near Rosken in Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container to the point of contact where people packed in.
About 20 fit in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of immigrants is the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary. People reported themselves in the eating and drinking strike until they are released to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Management of Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders, reduced half by the national gall by the national gallup.
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's support rate is still a two-digit race for the national presidential candidate of the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has turned away from the distance.
Clinton's support now amounts to 47 per cent of the votes of democratic Democrats (from 58 per cent), when Sanders is second with 27 per cent of the support (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, and his support among the democratics is 15%.
It is too early to tell who they are in favour of the candidate for more than five months before the elections for the majority of the Democrats.
However, Clinton's supporters are the supporters of other candidates more assured of their choice.
After the gallup made last month by CBS News, Clinton has lost a number of support for democratic groups, while the Sanders camp has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership role among women and moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly, and he only has a 5% stake over Sanders.
Clinton has lost leadership among democratics under the age of 50, and now he's on level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage over older voters.
In the last month, Clinton's advantage over Sanders was two-digital in favour of liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats would like to announce their support for Clinton if he is elected to the party.
The fourth would support Clinton with little reservations, and 15% would only support him because he was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support Clinton.
It is no surprise that the current Clinton supporters would be particularly enthusiastic, even if they were elected candidates.
There are more disintegrations among those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Only about a quarter would be eager to support him.
Of the democratic voters, 48% of the Republicans would be in favour of Clinton. For their part, only 35% of the Republican voters would be eager to support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
When Clinton's voters are freely asked to describe why they support his nomination, the most popular justification is Clinton's right experience (16 %). Secondly, the most popular answer is that it is time to choose the female president (13 %) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for the task (10 %).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection to Bill Clinton (9 %).
In addition, the similar views and the possibility of winning the actual elections are mentioned.
The Vice-President still put forward his possible nomination, and 57 per cent of democratic voters would like him to go to the race, and third of all would rather leave him out of the race.
When searching for the democratic voters for the second most popular candidate for the party's candidates, most of them will be elected by Biden.
Over half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and significantly more popular with Sanders.
If Biden does not leave for a democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase his way forward to Sanders. In the case of Sanders, there are 20 percentage points in advance, and it will grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders does not go into the race.
55 per cent of democratic voters consider Clinton to be a candidate with the best chance of winning actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78 per cent in the last month.
The second one is far from Clinton, but more people believe that Biden's chances of winning the real election are more than just one thing.
However, democratic voters consider the views on issues to be more important to the victory potential of candidates.
The voters do not consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be unacceptable to anyone.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be suitable for their characteristics.
Most people think that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable, and leadership types.
Biden is often described as being honest, whereas Clinton is most often regarded as the leading type.
Of the democratic voters, up to 30% do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, Sanders is 15%. 27% do not know whether Sanders is honest.
Democratic voters believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the ideology of the voters' own ideology.
About a quarter of all characteristics have no opinion of Sanders.
When people are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private email and its own server as Foreign Minister, the majority of the democratic voters say they are satisfied with Clinton's explanation and have not changed the views of these voters on Clinton.
In general, the Americans disagree.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only one third is satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March, when the conflict had just become public.
Most Americans believe that the use of contested email has not affected their overall image of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party consider Clinton to be honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when asked for the views of all the voters: Clinton considers only 32% honest and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all voters, 62 per cent do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not think Trump is honest and reliable either.
However, both Clinton and Trump receive good grades of leadership.
Six of the candidate Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable candidates in the questionnaire.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as for Carson, many people have no opinion about Sanders.
The survey sample is 351 voters and the questionnaire error margin is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson's cussing over Donald Trump's front of the Donald Trump National Support Force.
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest support check, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates had more than half of the votes in the new survey and left the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The contribution has risen from 23% of the CBS survey conducted by Fox News last month. According to a survey published on Tuesday, the share of the subsidy is 27 per cent.
However, Carson’s support for the same period would increase from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support in all population groups. In a highly educated group, he is greatly overthrown by Trump.
Other candidates, except Cary Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will remain far away. Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin's support is weaker and has fallen from 10% in the last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida split their third position with a support of 6%.
The margin of error of 376 Republican voters in the sample is 6% in the direction or the other, which was carried out in September.
According to the latest questionnaire from CNN and ORC last week, Carson's support is rising, which is in favour of 19% of Republicans when Trump's support is 32%.
Also in the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was clearly in charge of Carson's front.
In the last week of the men's encounter, Trump gave immediate accusations to retired neurosurgents, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said on Saturday he was campaigning in Iowa.
Five members of the Division on the ground of the death of Baruch College fus Fuks, accused of the Baruch College's fus of Baruch College's fus.
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the group's ritual, five people are charged with murder charges.
The members of the State University of New York Department of Pi Delta Pss were deeply abused by the nurses of Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. Police said that the department did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes had been tied, his back had been placed almost 15 kg of sand-filled bag, and he had been attacked repeatedly in his attempt to reach the target that was placed on the other side of the ice field.
Let's tell Deng first that he's chosen a headache and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps Department didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they're supposed to have waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Commissioner Chris Wabner told us at the press conference that, however, members were able to change Deng's clothes, googla his symptoms and contact Andy Mengi, Chairman of the Department.
"At this stage, members began hiding the tools to place the department's interest in Michael Deng's health front", Wagner said.
Dang couldn't be recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deg had been hit several times on the head, upper body and I traveled with a boring object.
"A number of families have been shocked by the involvement of the department, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the smoothing since 1970", Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng's family, says in his opinion.
The departments and their members must be responsible for taking an important step forward by the authorities.
The large jury of the Monro County presented five members of the department for prosecution of the third degree of murder.
In addition, 32 members of the department will be charged with smuggling and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want responsibility not only for individuals, but also for the organization officially or informally approved", Wagner told us at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College placed the department under an operating ban, and the national board resigned from the operation of the local division.
In this way, the rise in the interest rates of the central bank (Fedin) will affect the effect of the increase in the interest rates of the central bank of the central bank (Fedin) of the central bank of the central bank
The rise in interest rates and the increase in the stock market were fragile, the return on securities is rising and the economy is falling apart.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long it will take and how long the effects will last.
For the economy in particular, we find a way out of the history of timing.
The sheep has arrived up to 11 months after the first raise of interest rates and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank is often aggressively raising interest rates, not always. The crucial factor is how the financial and financial assets react.
Therefore, the central bank’s officials have already stressed that investors would not pay attention to the fact that the raising of interest rates is beginning but how long it will take to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, several variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators may note that all the volatility associated with the increase in interest rates may be over-represented.
"The first raise of the Central Bank following the global financial crisis has undoubtedly been interpreted as a sign of the end of bad money", Julian Jessop, the Capital Economics' chief global economics told their customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to be at a rather low level.
However, that does not mean that there would be no effect.
Examples based on this historical trend of how the effects can be seen in different economic sectors:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, an increase in interest rates may increase instability for some time.
When the interest rates are finally rising, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend seems to be that interest income on capital after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analyst, in the recent investigation of the effects of the increase in interest rates.
Over the 35-year period, the market generally shows a sharp increase in interest rates, around 14 per cent, relatively evenly following 250 days (mean increase 2.6 per cent), after 500 days, and the average rate of return after six stock increases is 14.4 per cent, says Bob Doll, the Nuveen Asset Management Chief equivalent strategy in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on the shares is generally slightly later in the cycle and interest yields are beginning to decrease.
The flat is a reality in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually works at it.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist in the past and could speed up the billing process.
It is of particular importance that the GDP is the lowest ever in terms of the central bank’s interest rate increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, the nominal value has been less than 4,5 per cent since the increase in the interest rate of 118 in the year 1950; only twice the nominal value has been less than 4,5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015, 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it lasting, and in the third quarter there is 1.5 per cent, says the Central Bank of Atlanta.
In raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic situation, there may be a risk and it may be asked whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
The market participants have spoken about the increase in the steering rate throughout the year, and the views will turn to this week’s meeting of the Open Market Committee (Fedral Open Market Committee), which ends on Thursday.
Many strategies and economies believe that even if the open market committee accepts a rise at this meeting, the future trade seems to be only 25% likely.
"Our investigations since 1950 have been in a supercycle, where GDP declines very rapidly before the fall-down," says the report.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst sheep in the control period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, it is now going for 74 months.
In addition, fixed-income securities have been unstable in the past in terms of interest rates, and the formula is also repeated in capital terms.
"The marginal difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the direction immediately when the first recovery/invoicing cycle starts.
At the end of the pickup cycle, the yields will drop immediately", Deutsche said.
The strategicists of Charles Schwabin believe that the drawing-up will bring long and short-term bonds of bonds closer to each other and to offset the curves.
"Credit bonds are often better in such an environment, even though we are still cautious about income", Schwab said Kathy, the analyst of fixed-income securities in Schwab, Kathy.
Fascinatingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future directional path of the central bank.
"A number of signs have already been seen," Jones says.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the rate of return is direct, the credit risk margins have expanded and the volatility has increased; all are typical of the market in a situation where the central bank is tightening up policies.
In general, companies that operate mainly on the US market benefit because interest rates fall and local products start to attract.
The outlook for the debtor multinationals is weaker, as the stronger dollar will make their products grow on the global market and the debt will rise.
"Histor shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months", Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet were at the top of the average of five percentage points following interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital and low volatility shares also managed better than in quality, on average 4 and 3 percentage points better, respectively.
"It's a big question.
Companies that have a significant share of the rate of exchange rate debt will lose most," Goldman said.
Consumers outside the stock market generally also benefit from a dollar increase.
The savings will also benefit from higher productivity. The experts are, however, dissatisfied about how quickly the effects will be visible.
President Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a classic FM copy of the Classic FM copy.
The conservative Andrew Bingham criticises the radio station for excessive popularity.
According to Bingham, the channel is now difficult to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
The BBC Music Awards prize is also claimed to be only a copy of the Brits Gala.
For its part, the House of Nations has accused The Voice channel of impersonality.
According to the relevant parliamentary committee, BBC Radio 3 is gradually turning into a copy of the Classic FM channel.
The conservative Andrew Bingham also told the management of the BBC that the broadcaster's radio is becoming too popular and that it is no longer channelling itself from its commercial competitors.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing in the direction of Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards awards awarded last December also receive criticism from Bingham:
"The BBC Music Awards held for the first time last year seems like a copy of the Brits Prize Awards.
These two are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, just imitate what is already on the market", Bingham states.
The president of the BBC denied the accusations and found that BBC Radio 3 provided a commercial competitor with significantly more live music and selective content.
"From Radio 3 I learned from classical music something I can't learn from other channels.
The channel's commitment to live music and music is to its own class.
I also believe that Radio 3 is also committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the Director-General.
In the past year, Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3 said that the position must work more closely to keep the public's attention, as the British know better about classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only critical part of having taken part in the BBC channel, in consultation with the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
The Tory Party's Parliamentary, Damien Collins, assessed The Voice's competitiveness competition, which BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price of the trade is estimated at GBP 22 million.
"There is little discussion about the subject, because it is not unique or unusual."
According to the Lord, the program presented by BBC1, whose stars were excellent for Palama Faith and Boy George, was produced in a typical manner to BBC.
In addition, Collins asked the company to look for a slow program in its own pocket, as it next time launches a new series of entertainments.
However, it did not agree to exclude the fact that the Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers’ money would be used for other entertainment formats.
The slowest increase in online trade in August — possibly due to the black Friday night — was the reason for the increase in the number of times in August.
In the first months of 2015, the net sales increased by 7 per cent.
Net sales have been statistics since 2000. Last month's growth was the slowest of all time.
The online trade was strengthened three years ago by mobile participation.
Experts believe that November’s black Friday can slow down the purchase request.
For more than ten years, the acquisition of the online store has been depreciating many of the British purchasing campaigns.
According to experts, there are indications that the online trade is about to stabilise, and the new sales figures show only seven per cent increase over the first three months of 2015 in the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was slow throughout the whole period when sales of the online trade have been statistics, i.e. since 2000. Last year the net sales increased by only 5 per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that the online trade is about to stabilise, and the new sales figures show only seven per cent increase over the first three months of 2015 in the first three months of 2015.
"If last year's growth is compared to 2000's, it's clear that it's up to time", IRG's editor Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the online trade accelerated three years ago, when consumers accepted mobile distribution.
"There was an increasing number of people who could buy from the network, and it was possible to buy many people in a different environment, for example, from home to hand.
With a more moderate mobile consumption now, growth may get even."
Black Friday from America is a phenomenon considered one of the causes of growth slowing down.
According to experts, the day to be spent last Friday of November can enable consumers to postpone their purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year, a five-fold number of network operators, compared with normal, caused many traders’ websites to fall.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which will allow consumers to hang on to their tenders, can slow down the demand for shopping during the rest of the period.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, fair Pounds of each of five pounds were consumed online.
More than one third of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are purchased from online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the net instead of fashion stores for shopping.
The dress burys the victims of crane accidents, Bin Laden's family's responsibility for the liability of Bin Laden's family.
The Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funeral is held in Mekka.
According to Saudi Arabia, the construction major company Saudi Binladin Group is part of the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane went down.
The bodies were decked in high air when the Muslims gathered together to bury the 29 victims of the rebel that fell on Mekka's Grand Grand Master.
A number of white-dressed people had gathered on the streets to say goodbye to the victims on their last trip to Al-Moaissem's cemetery.
The death occurred at the sanctuary where the fallen building site was only one day earlier infiltrated through the Moscow roof on the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia requires Bin Laden’s construction family company to be responsible for an accident in addition to 394 people who were injured.
The bodies of the 29 victims who died in the Mekka's High-Smoke's crane accident were transported on the streets.
After the fall of the crane, there was Qasim Akram, from the Bolton of the Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca's first holy service.
Akram had been with his parents in the Great Boy who had started their annual hair-sitting trip.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised to arrange for a hair-supervising to take place when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for the sanctuary.
According to King Salman, the Binlad Group should not have left the cranes up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabic press release, the Binlad Group is part of the accident.
The English-language service of the news office did not report this in detail. According to the English press, the Group's management is, however, prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane’s fall in the yard of the Grand Ambulance. Thousands of Muslims will be headed for the Supreme Championship’s hair-suffering later this month.
Binlad's Group has not published a notice of nostalgicness, nor has the Group's representatives been targeted for the opinion.
The King also accused the group that it had failed to comply with the current safety regulations and cooperated with meteorology experts.
The ten cranes are surrounded by Mekka's Grand Garden as part of the giant construction project by Binlad Group.
The Bin Laden family has had close links for decades with the Sovereign Family of Saudi Arabia, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
El Osama bin Laden, the late leader of Al Qaida, was a apostate son whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
There were only a few days before the sanctification of Mekka, who is obliged to do at least once in life for every capable Muslim.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities ordered the payment of a million rials (e.g. 250 000 euros) to the victims and permanent injured persons.
The other injured persons will receive half of the amount of compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, behind the phenomenon there is a cheap Eastern European labour force.
The British hire more and more people in their homes, says Veronique Laury.
There has been an increase in the number of people who come from Eastern Europe who are skilled, workers who are employed.
More than 200 new Srewfix stores for workers are opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores around the country.

The British are told to move the home's hammering and painting industry to those who come from Eastern Europe.
The risk and painting skills today seem to be very rare.
The British are now more and more likely to hire generals at home to carry out their work on vercing, reports the director of the company behind the B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO at Kingfisher, who owns the shop chain for repairs in the home. According to Laury, there are professional workers coming from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new, new, commercial-oriented Swedishfix stores, while 60 B&Q shops are closed.
Laury needs more female labour for B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store make women.
At present, the majority of staff are men.
According to Laury, attention should be paid to the population trends, as more and more women living alone now also make up for their homes.
"Our sales staff are still mostly men," says Laury.
"We must strike a balance between the situation and the situation.
Half of our clients are women, and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women have an important role to play in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are at the top of the British FTSE 100 index companies, and he has also reorganised the board of directors of the company so that men and women are equal to the heads of the company.
Kingfisher is almost the only one of its own, as 50% of its staff are women, including the Executive Director and the Managing Director.
"This was an informed decision, and diversity is an important topic for us," Laury told me.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the board."
Kingfisher's half-year business profit and sales figures have decreased, although the company worked hard to complete the business after the liquidation of the stores.
Kingfisher is in line with current trends: the company owns Screenfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-year-old government decided to rely on a mandatory legislation to save the country's economy.
The apparent effects were achieved pretty quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees' centres began to force the country to stand on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
In time, many people think that there will also be a sense of reason.
Let's see if it's okay to stop when it's bad anyways.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to report that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but that they are going to work.
This would have been impossible in an old consensus period.
Of course, there was nothing online where to protest, but in an open sense the declaration of an act of corruption would have been a small political suicide of man.
Millions of trade unions are protested by a few tens of thousands of people, but it gives a reason for thinking.
The status of trade union movements is no longer as obvious as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the objectives of the movement in their own ownership, values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement's activities, government's rough solutions can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have looked like they've been on their own for years, it's finally time for the parties to reach the issue, that is, workers' rights to defend, appear, and properly.
Thus, the government may be able to seize the role of ay movement when membership in trade union may be seen as perhaps more necessary than before.
Whatever happens to the activities of the organisations, it is a horrendous fact that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped long ago.
For example, industrial output has been down by 31 months in the successive period.
GDP continues to decline and unemployment is rising.
These things should make everyone think they are.
Hard savings for the University of Lapland: To reach 8.5 million savings, the staff are reduced by 130 with 130 employees.
The University of Lappeenranta will start a savings account with the aim of obtaining a total of EUR 8,5 million of cut-off costs.
As part of savings, the University will start all staff negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 employees.
The aim of the other activities is also to save two million.
In the context of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is the budget, which expects the actual operation to be a deficit of 8.5 million.
It also affects the government’s financial operations.
During the financial year, the university will deliver about 2.6 million net deficits.
The expenditure will increase slightly for the next year, but the financing from the same Ministry will be reduced by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the university is around EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10 % of the total budget.
The interaction between massive cuts in teaching and research and the reduction of corporate financing with our university is very important, says President Anneli Pauli in the communication from the University of Pauli.
Before summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but the reduction in the financial envelope now appears in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will take six weeks in law.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finnish railways.
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in entering Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
Rail transport is intended to gradually open up to competition.
The first place is the local traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
There is a distance between the distance and the distance after the passing of the journey.
Souter is telling us that he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
Yle says that onnibus plans will be welcomed.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has been informed about other international companies' interest in rail transport, which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in other parts of Europe.
The central bank of the central bank has the maturity of the interest-time period of the interest-rate period.
The whole world will follow the meeting of the U.S. Central Bank Fed on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
A fair half of the econ accounts, which last week believed the central bank would raise interest rates, are now taking the central bank's residual interest rate at between 0 and 0,25% of the current level of interest rates, which is reflected in the questionnaire made by Reuters 80 economic scientists.
"This is a historic situation, as the central bank has kept the interest rate zero to feel seven years already.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from zero levels and thus trigger normalisation of interest rates," said Peterson Institute for International Economics' senior researcher Angel Ubide, Angel Ubide.
The state of the U.S. economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of extra dollars into the balance sheet and has accelerated inflation slightly.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the global situation, which is not as Rose.
It has called on the market to prepare for the change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision to publish on Thursday 20.00 Central Europe time is due to take place.
The Delta State University shooter left an apology form for the letter of apology.
After shooting at his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — before a colleague was shot later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote out a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hoped he could cancel it, the authorities said on Tuesday.
Lamb, who taught road and social science at the Mississippi Gauutier University, Delta State University of Delta State University, called 911 from 10 a.m. in the morning.
Monday and told me that he shot a man.
Lamb asked the police to go home in an emergency call.
"I was shooting my wife last night", Lamb told me, and he also mentioned that there was a nice dog in the house, and there was no harm to anyone but he's probably scared.
The police asked me the name of the caller, but the man didn't tell me that.
Lamb also didn't tell me the motive to shoot.
The police arrived at the scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, body and Lamb's hand-written message that reads as follows: "I'm very sorry and I hope that I could cancel my actions.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University, where he killed history professor Ethan Schmidt before he took off his life late on Monday, when the police reached him.
Professor William LaForge of the University told me that he was not aware of the contradictions between Lamb and Schmidt, but noted that Lambia was clearly troubled by something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentiss was romantically in relation to Schmidt, but the authorities reported on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence of the triangle.
Shawn O'Steen, who had been married to Prentis for seven years, described his former wife as a good man.
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is upset.
According to the man, the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sunaldi, Prentiss' close friend Lindsay Knowles told me that Prentiss worked online from home hand.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog called Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others", Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them that he wasn't going to prison.
When the police reached Lamb's Highway 1 near Greenville on the same night, Lamb stopped the car, fled the foot, ran into the forest and took off the spirit of himself.
According to the University's CV on the University's website, Lamb received a doctorate at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Died stars in the inflamed stars
The last few years have been heavy for an actor (at the left hand with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought against leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything has really been up to its taxes.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw page for months due to two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right leg was broken in a fight against PSV Eindhoven in the league of Manchester United Masters.
The defender is sorry to stay on the side for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field during this period.
A 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence area in the bad fighting of Héctor Moreno when the game was held fifteen minutes ago.
Shaw got a first call on the field for nine minutes and needed some air before he could be transferred to a hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital." Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred tomorrow or tomorrow for surgery to Manchester.
The youngster who joined Manchester United when he was 18, has experienced hard and is now injured after the amazing playwrights.
In the dressbox, Shaw was given oxygen.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when you break your leg on two points, he's on the side for half a month and he's not playing part-stage anymore.
I hope he can play the game again this season.
Moreno seemed to have reached a very low level when the situation did not follow the red card penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Galal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You made the decision yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-legged detention jacket."
Shaw mentioned this: "Thank you all for your messages, I can't tell you how sad I am, my recovery starts here and I'm going back stronger."
More on: Manchester Unitedin Luke Shaw on the side of the PSV match in Manchester Unitedin Luke Shaw.
The defender of England has a particular reason to recover from the competition for the European Championships held in France in June.
"This is a very serious injury", said the coach of the PSV.
"In these injury situations, all parties are always very sorry.
The aim of the players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his leg when he played Mexico in line with the Van Galal created the Netherlands only in the 2014 World Championships.
"He is very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It is sad to hear that the injury is serious", Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I just saw the ball that was headed the other way, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's jacket."
"I know what it feels like, but I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"I feel really bad, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to a hospital after a crash with Chris Modeling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Each parent will notice before long that the child learns his favorite book almost outside.
Except for you to see David Cameron.
When the children's vacation organization asked Cameron to designate his child's favorite favorite, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, in 1971, to teach Dr. Seuss an environmental story, published by Dr. Seuss.
In the text published on SuperCamp's website Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "Tartina is fun, touching and creative, and has a powerful message. I would like to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we have never noticed before."
It's good, except that the next point where Cameron is supposed to describe the draft book is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complete a brief initial text.
In 1991, Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, the version of the Geisel did not have the object of love. Ted, who was killed in 1991, did not have the object of love.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text is partly linked to the draft summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It begins with: "In the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get his dreams into the heart of the girl Audrey."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book plan would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskanen destroys trees and prepares them for the Needs for the name character regardless of Lorax's opposition. Lorax is a small and thick, cold creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that such a minor pr-task is believed to be an assistant, apparently someone who has not read Loracex 20 times as a child, in a tube.
The Prime Minister's representative said that the text was probably from the Cameron Electoral Office.
SuperCamps did not comment specifically but confirmed that the text was the handbook of Cameron's staff.
Clearly, Adam Lyth was in danger of being away from the English team, but it's still hard.
Pakistan's encounter in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but we are seeing the recent 3-0 Test series loss of the last team selected for the tour of England is not expected to happen.
I wouldn't shut down the possibility of a foreign gain.
Alastair Cook's side may be more experienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences in 2012, only youthful positives.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a thread-eater, and Adil Rashid, even though he does not have test level experience, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the British Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth away is obviously hard for me to understand his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven tests have been in two good circumstances against the attack, and simple and cruel truth is that the critics of the Crickets are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best choices.
A few 50-point fights would have been on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets another chance when he hits Yorkshire with more runners.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when he did not do as well as could have been, which did not surprise me. He is above all a team player.
The question of how long the Test killer will be given an opportunity to impress him is difficult.
Lyth received seven goals — like his predecessor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton was given the opportunity for both home and guest games.
The only subject for complaints is perhaps the fact that England used Jonathan Trott first in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in a state of excellence – but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is on the team, and he's a hitter, and I'm a high-ranking hitter.
He's an unknown author of the Cricket player we saw earlier in Yorkshire this year when he made 236 points against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been thrown into the air is that Moeen will start a game with Cook, which will bring an extra round-eater into the game while keeping four fast-eaters, and I am not against the idea.
I can't see the fact that a high-level feeder could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great Cricket player.
It may not have been enough for his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played the first 38 Test matches as the first replacement player before starting in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a backupist, and based on what I've seen from him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 baits – and this can be a search ammo, but a lot of string-offers have not shown themselves to be ready, and voters decided to take a young player.
He'll learn a lot during this match trip.
Outside the game team, England seems to have made a couple of smart choices to train staff.
The appointment of a Sri Lanka hiter, Mirc Jayawardenen, as the adviser to the Test games may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most delicate men of the species that brings with them a lot of experience, because he has played under all kinds of circumstances and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes from a gambling trip to the white ball, including both energy and innocence.
I think that he has always had an impact on an appropriate international criticism, whether his role as a player or coach, and like Mahela, he has a useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same thing as before, may be a cheering injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, the coach and the voters do not set the timetable for the match.
And it should be borne in mind that, like players, their job also depends on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without consideration.
The Brexit camp can win if the economy is at a bad rate in 2017
The renewed strategy for maintaining the United Kingdom in the EU, which remains half-way to David Cameron, is becoming deeper and deeper by day, even without the desire to please Jeremy "yes or not" the choice of Corbyn for the leader of the Labour Party or for the TUC, was fierceing Europe on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragsa.
Recently, a European diplomat explained how many crises the EU is facing – although not everyone is doing their own job; some Member States are tired of the British's own agenda, which includes the concessions and harmful changes to the Treaty which they do not really want.
In Brighton, at the annual Congress of TAC, it was decided that they would not enjoy themselves in the EU, if it undermines social security.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Federal Chancellor will hang at the summits and in bilateral negotiations in the capital cities of different countries, will take a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without seniors, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reform purposes.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be in the EU headquarters, wants to be a modest British. "Don't leave us alone with France", Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that we no longer care whether we are staying or leaving.
Angela Merkel, Germany's thinking of a sensible alliance is ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it is ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France France France France Netherlands faces a re-election or follow-up in 2017.
His power is floating, too.
Poland may soon have a national judicial government, in Spain again a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them rushing around to help selfie britts, who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK, but they do not want it because most people have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers can plan to put in their will useless comments to the Scottish National Party's style in the UK's 2017 referendum, which is intended to speed up the Brexit process, my friend proposes.
"The negotiations had been held" "The UK had nothing left in hand about the renegotiation negotiations."
The Europeans know how to catch the British press and how the EU-sceptic oligarch press is, just like the 1975 referendum on Tony Benn, the outcome of which was in favour of 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Some may recall the distantly Boris Johnson, a knifely Euro-opportunist, who became known as our "Our direct mailer to the EU" in Brussels in the early '90s.
At least Ediband knew his enemies.
These include tax evasion, telephone hacking and visional-term residences, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about the same things about them, but then he realized that when he's in a cage with a rough gorilla, he'd have to hand out bananas as a spider, so that the gorilla wouldn't eat you for lunch and dinner.
Miliband was also Blair's biliariist in opposition to the referendum. Blair accepted the constitution of the EU, which was then rejected. When France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the referendum in 2005, Blair was readily reached.
The press never forgiven him for that either.
But the nice Jeremy Corby who killed me kindly back at Westminster on Monday, and I told him he didn't have time to waste me anymore, and it might be dangerous for him to introduce a Neil Kinnock mediabook strategy in the '80s.
It may take some time, but Corbyn has to develop a coherent strategy for dating with the media. Not with me, but Andrew Marrin, who was sitting on the BBC phone on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn on Europe is what we politely call building.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed Europe.
Most of the people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to be eligible for this.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennit" Benn told me on radio and television this week when his internal patrol boy tried not to admit that it was Corbyn's a bad bet to call a kass John McDonald as a shadow minister.
It reminded me of the 70th century when his old father had difficulty not going too far and without losing his place in the lower room on TV.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU 'in all circumstances'. McDonnel did not say so to his colleagues and members of the room at a private meeting on Monday night.
Corby wanted to care about any picture of the baby, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The Vibe is important for a 24/7 period, especially in social media discipline, where paranoia and fraud can be overcome.
Cameron does not need to be given a free pass on the EU's relationship, which would allow him to see the support of Labour as obvious in the referendum, as McDonnell has said.
That's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
McDonnell's and Corby's equivodication on EU membership is suitable for an island economy and anti-capitalism past. Discussions are no longer just a small circle of left-wing dissident dissidents, to which the idea of combining similarity is a fundamental lesson in the doctrineal horrors.
As far as NATO is concerned, there has been an equivodication. Tom Watson is unbridled in the fact that Corby is not campaigning for his departure. Foreign diplomats must try to clarify this matter to their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they grant concessions to Britain when everything can be useless?
The United States has already been quite disappointed at the British's unfortunate military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the Tory regime, and I was reminded of it on Monday during the attack of the British Influence Security Forum.

According to researchers, the claims made by the state-funded body that the smoking of electric cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking were created at a meeting of 12 participants in which some of the 12 participants are linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence provided in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal by the Public Health England (PHE) e-publishment report.
PHE described his report published last month for "reversive and comprehensive review of the results".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the security of information and highlighted the links between some experts in the tobacco industry.
Last month, Lancet Medical Journal's conclusion was taken into the teeth of "a remarkable Hebrew base", which is based on the main conclusion of PHE's.
In addition, two researchers in the BMJ have considered whether the claims have been established for "end or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medical European Public Health Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool have stated: "The basic assumption of public health is that the principles of action are based on a clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKeen and Capewell, the public assumes that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that electronic cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of the results of research.
The claim is based on a single 12-person meeting called for a multi-purpose assessment (MCDA) model to be developed. The model was designed to bring the participants' views on the harmful effects of nicotine products. The results were gathered in research.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the participants of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, whose previous independent research by the Executive Director has been financed by British American Tobacco (BAT) by sources.
In addition, the Executive Director expressed his support in the Report on Sustainable Action for the activities of BAT in accordance with public health.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from the electric-acid-prepared manufacturer, and the alleged funding from Philip Morris International did not grant that participant.
No explanation has been given concerning the criteria for the composition of the panel. However, there are a number of well-known beneficiaries of electronic money, some of which contribute to the financing of industry.
However, some participants are not aware of their expertise in combating smoking.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco supervisor.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no undisputed evidence of the harmful nature of the products as regards a wide range of products and meeting their criteria.
However, there are no links or shortcomings mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, there is so far no evidence that electric cigarettes can contribute to the smoking of children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim to be premature.
According to PHE’s Director of Health and Welfare, Professor Kevin Fenton, the claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Everyone else who smokes through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco; however, the long-term effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens what evidence shows and what does not indicate, especially in situations where the relative risks from traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, nearly 80 000 smoking deaths per year are caused by public health costs of 2 billion pounds per year.
Responsible action requires that we make a clear presentation of the current evidence that electric cigarettes are not a risky alternative, but their causing harm is a fraction of the damage caused by traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, under Channel 4’s leadership, has stated that BBC should stop sending certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson said commercial competitors would give their right hand from a hitter, such as the soap show Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the license fee should be used only for the performance of programmes that are not made by other television stations.
He criticises BBC's probably lower public access programmes at the same time as competitors' large viewers programmes, and, for example, on the BBC4 channel.
When Tony Hall, Director-General of BBC, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying to get Channel 4 to cooperate with BBC for six years.
"I do not agree with the idea of BBC buying formats and sending out programs that would clearly be part of some competing channel software", Johnson told the communication committee of Parliament, which explained the future of the BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a broadcasting fee, which I think may not be a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC will send The Voice to its best viewing time, as it will require the widest possible support for the future.
If no other channel is worried about the program, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why the aggressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without aid," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders another, even though it is its own production.
Many channels would give their right hand to it.
I don't understand how this serves the service provided by the public service provider.
I don't think these would be any loss to BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur, led by Channel 4 2004-2010, who believes that BBC is a good viewer figure because the company is working on ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the most popular series of BBC's are similar to that of former Sky boss Tony Ballin, who proposed that BBC sells series such as EastEnders in 2003 as MacTagart's lecture.
According to Johnson, the programs for BBC's Niche audience are shown on the BBC4 channel, where the viewers are most often not able to measure, but the programs do not fulfil their purpose."
"BBC presents them in times where no one will ever see them."
On broadcasting, Johnson said: "I want you to find someone else in the sense of the same old-fashioned system that who gets the best benefits from it.
Of course, everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is affordable, but people to whom it is a big sum, especially if BBC is not exactly looking."
David Elstein, former director of the Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also told his own views in committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange its ancient missions with the new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein's current offer, there is hardly any educational programs – 1% on television and 0.1% on radio. He adds that BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and start its mission into a new belief: "information, lighting and entertainment".
On the issue of cooperation, Elstein suggests that BBC could increase postings such as events, such as the Proms festival, which was sent last year only a fraction of the concerts. "BBC should also join allians with commercial channels in order to make the whole offer available online", he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics.
The video shows how the shuttle painting is changing its direction when they are exposed to the ultrasound.
Researchers have grown worms with a genetically altered nervous system, which can be used to control worms by ultrasound.
Small shuttle beams are changing their direction when they are targeted at an ultrasound whose frequency is above the hearing area of the ear of the human ear.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified so that they have a transport line that reacts to the ultrasound.
More on: Researchers will monitor the brain’s activity with light.
According to researchers, a new sogenetic method (dubbed sonogenetics) was able to demonstrate the power of the worms. In the process ultrasounds are used to activate the brain, heart and muscle cells by an irritation from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a research researcher at Salk Instuten, in La Jolla, California, told Guardian that one day the method could replace a deep-brained stimulant (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat Parkinson’s disease symptoms in which the brain is stimulated by electrical pulses.
The shells do not normally react to the ultrasound. Chalasani found that the snakes, however, start to react when they are placed in a liquid with microscopic small bubbles.
According to the Chalasan, the bubbles are amplifying the ultrasonic waves that go into the worms.
Increased ultrasound waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the cell membranes of the worms.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, the sound waves make these ion channels open and activate cells they are attached to.
In order to guide shuttle land with ultrasonic Chalasani transformed the worms genetically so that some of the nerves that guide their movement appeared in the TRP4 ionics.
When the shifted mats were controlled by the ultrasound, the microcrumbs strengthened the sound waves and moved to the worms, when a signal was released in the nerve cell.
The method reminds you of a little bit of optogeneetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells by light.
However, according to Chalasan, sonogenetics has certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brain subject to the study using light fibers, but low-contrast ultrasounds can easily pass through the cell, so the ultrasound can be channeled to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that genetic therapy and viral therapy can provide immediate exposure to ultrasonic signals in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments", Chalasan said.
According to the investigator, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Unlawful torture equipment – with your home door!
Advertising is a disgrace to British arms trade.
Look at Amnessy International's anti-armed Mass video.
Crying killer controls.
Wires with broken legs.
Frightening bombs.
Protamizers that cause unacceptable pain but do not leave any trace behind.
The happy voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertising of the world’s largest position fairs is parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the British government’s attempt to sell weapons to the repression governments at the ExCel Centre for Security and Defence (DSEI), which is held in London’s Docklands.
More on: DSEI sessions: authorial governments arrive in London, London.
There are also posters in the carways and subways that require a second look.
"High notice: are you moving on a subway between 15 and 18 September?"? The notice recalls the announcements of London's subway from its appearance. There is a picture of the tanker on the other side of the subway line.
"In September, a bunch of gun dealers arrive at Docklands, and customers are invited to help us eliminate the weapons fairs."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who were working at the Banks Disney Museum of Cruise Designs.
A collector named Special Patrol Group, who helped to distribute posters across London with six pounds of "a commercial space hacking kit", which has six-hour keys that claim to be accessible to about one-third of the advertising posters of bus stops in the world.
Transport for London does not laugh at poster vandalism.

According to Gavin Grindon, the curator of the Cruel Designs and the professor at the University of Essex, artists have started to question things and want to bring their political work into the public to see outside the gallery.
The artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art is brought into the world. Many people are also moving to work with the activists of protest movements.
One of the posters against arms trade greeted public transport users in the metro.
Amnesty's video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times per day. It has been designed without compensation by VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the teller have also done their job without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of the VCCP, missed the absence of Massusmics and an empty scene at the ExCeL event calendar. He said, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They tried to get a more realistic, dazzling corporate video, but bright colors and animation better attract attention."
"They have done a wonderful job and helped us to highlight fairs in which illegal torture equipment trade is conducted," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally traded on our way home."
However, perhaps the most creative antia from the stations is displayed itself in the exhibition facilities in ExCeL, where the actors who play the stage make use of the great circulatory expressions of their trades.
In his press release, Saab announced an order made by the US military concerning "the AT4CS RS to be transmitted".
The product includes "a special-shaped battleloaf that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound pleasant.

I moved to student housing 11 years ago. I was innocent 19 years old, and I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, and only now I remember the violent smiles that I was annoying, and countless, long complaints in other countries.
The main lessons I can concentrate on eight simple rules.
The migration of the dwelling is the least demanding experience and at worst shocking.
You tell everyone what you are, how you like Corbyn and why you don't really hate or love Marmite, because it's just a shriek, huh, I'm in my room.
Take a breath sometimes.
And help others to breathe: show your interest and ask other questions.
Question will guide the debate and help you find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even when your peacocks are present and these people will split fire extinguishers.
Give the rest of the room.
The own rooms are often used as drinks, cinemas and general living rooms, but their own room is also a place where dress is made from underwear.
On the subject: Don't even imagine combining your interaction and university studies.
For introverts, the university is a tough place.
The room should be a place of calming. However, in a number of settlements there is a social culture, where people walk from one room to another and make lifelong friendships.
This culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
It is not possible to say: "I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I want you to get out so I can download back the energy I used by dating you."
Try to find out if someone of your fellow students is exhausted from social communication, but maybe you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own student home, there was a guy who thought the locked door meant that he was welcome in.
He saw things all over the place.
Make friends with bread.
You start your study properly when bakeing is in, so if you bake browns and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a '50s, a little weird case: 'Welcome to the neighborhood, I've got something for you. smile when I get personal from you.'
Homemade treats are a great way to make new friends.
Your partner needs to talk to you, but thanks to a pleasant surprise, they can have a positive picture of you.
This, of course, requires reasonable bakery skills from you.
If you serve unhappy cooks of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Food thinning is also a common failure in student housing.
Taking another chicken is, of course, stealing, but can you do that to pour a drop of another milk can from someone else's milk can?
Always make sure the owner of the milk can.
You'll probably get permission, even though the milk loan to the owner of your jurist's can too.
I understand that it is annoying for someone to try to get something from you, but try to deal with the situation as adultly as possible – unlike my own college partner who gave his milk a washing pill to punish dairy thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make me laugh when everyone else tries to sleep or pick up.
It's not just that it's polite, but you should also remember that every other hole you dig...
In my living room, a girl asked the resident of the next room to adjust the pace of music, for it was three in the morning, and she had a exam in the morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume of votes.
At last, when I was quiet in the next room, the girl allowed her neighbor to sleep for two hours, and she went out for three hours, left her music to clean up her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be weird if you thought that your fellow student would be your future mate, start dating, break up and have to see him every day and lose the right to meet your fellow friends?
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if the student mate is definitely not the only right one, try to hold on to his desire.
If you find that someone has forgotten their keys to a room where the door is not locked, the limit of tricking and bullying is more cloudy than you might think.
It's a good joke, but the one you'll be able to recover from in a moment.
Hide an object can be a valuable and fun lesson, but no room should be dirty with a toothpaste and the mollusc.
The door of the second room can be locked and folded with a glass of water placed in the freezer, but do not attach any of the things to the ceiling with a seal a few more times.
Ra racist attack at foreign students’ residence in Kitela, Kitela - The house that was designed for the reception center was hit in Salo Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo, Salo.
On Saturday morning, a racist attack was made on Kite in northern Karelia.
Unlike the police before, it is not accommodation for minors asylum seekers, but for foreign students who have been living in Finland for a longer time, says Heidi Lukkainen, the teacher of the State College of Kiteen Evankelinen, says.
The windows and walls of the Parliament's accommodation facilities were jolted with racist characters, such as hats, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the accommodation spaces, reports Eastern Finland's police.
According to Lukkainen, the responsibility teacher of youth guarantee education at the University of Nations, the building was estimated at ten people at the time of the attack when the violence was committed.
"It's been a weekend and adult people who are free to move, and some may have been elsewhere," says Lukkainen.
There are people from 12 different nationalities who have been housed at the National College.
They are already students who have been in Finland for some time as well as minors who have just arrived.
All those in the mixed building have a status status.
She is a student at adult school, she is a part of vocational studies and she is a Finnish student", says Lukkainen.
A status is so-called a permanent residence permit, which can be granted for four years in Finland for a foreign resident who has already been present for some time.
The Eastern Finnish police are investigating the attack as a damage and a violation of home peace.
According to a large number of people, students were held at a press conference on Monday, where there were also the necessary interpreters.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had 20 years of foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," says Lukkainen.
According to a lot of people, the mess has been cleaned out of the walls by now.
The authors suspected that there had been at least three men and they had been on the move by a light passenger car.
I think this is the end of a youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," says Lukkainen.
There has also been a hacked hospital in Salo, which has been designed for reception centre.
The incident happened last week.
The matter was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
On the wall of the hospital, a hacker was drawn and written in English "You are not welcome".
A criminal report has been made to the police.
Revision 15 September at 16.02 Revised by the police, corrected by incorrect information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state of the Y-train to the Lamb... the passengers are chewing, "the old idiotic"
The Y-train going from Helsinki to Raasepor to Karelia will cease to pass in March.
The news made passengers entering the train start-up at Helsinki main railway station.
In particular, there is a downward trend in the Siuntian population, said Torbjörn Bengtström, the municipality of Torbjörn Bengtström.
It's stupid because the number of inhabitants is growing all the time and the people who work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing other than political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is coming on the tractor to the capital.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains on the main track will be combined into a new R-line.
I'm going to break into the station in Lake End and the Nuppunna Tuuskussa are going to be decommissioned.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes the Ministry of Transport to purchase train transport for the following contract term.
The season will change in the course of the year and there will be closed routes throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs later on.
Sir Bengtström considers that the State's train shuttle is a short-sighted activity.
Make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated them in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be regret on top.
Y-trains are also used by others other than Raaseporans and Siunists, because it is fast and will pass over several stations.
In Espoo, Annina Pöyry was harmed by the train to the fate of travelers beyond the urban area.
"It's really bad for those who have to plan their trip again," he said when he was in pain with his Y-train.
A little relief is promised.
It is likely that a new train connection will come to the beach, which will replace Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HSL) region, i.e. to take you to Kirkkonummän.
This increases costs for HSL, in principle, the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
The costs are still impossible to assess carefully.
According to Rihtniemi, based on the number of passengers, the HSL has paid about a million dollars a year from the Y train, the Ministry does much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves between two positions.
On the other hand, the number of train posts in Ainola and Saunakallio doubles.
The whole country will end up with 28 small positions and numerous routes.
The Ministry will no longer buy train services from the routes of Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinjoki.
The small mountainous river-skiing route is shortened as a route to the Little Mountain-War.
The train tours are reduced on the routes of Riihinäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, the port of Kovola-Kotka and Kajani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are made in closing shifts, while the total number of trips in transport purchased by the ministry is around nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the State.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the book "Marx is good to get to know."
The crisis in the global economy has surfaced Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his conclusion published in 1867-1894 to capital, writing the current state of Marx capital in the book, published today by Yrjö Hakanen, the former President of GDP.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time", Hakanen writes in his introductory words.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and intrusiveness of the capital economy increasingly far-reaching in all areas of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly far-reaching.
The list of authors of the book, based on the Capital Seminars, is also published by Professor of Aalto University, a respected financial partner, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx in its current "fort and forever".
However, the former Executive Director of the Industrial Research Institute and the Economic Affairs Committee is not a Marxian, is he?
Oh, no.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not consider Marx as a timely economic thinker, but rather as an interesting socialist.
Today social sciences have been isolated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and literary class.
"The public understanding is that the architect tells the wrong opinions of the dead men," Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went really bad.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew the conclusions that were too far-reaching of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
However, Korkman sees value in the radical attitude of Marx.
"The more relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are discussing the interests of Marx as well as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may perhaps give inspiration to those who want to understand a big picture, as a result of technological embellishment into a changing world", Korkman analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not helpful for Marx.
He thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Even so, Korkman feels it's worth getting to know him.
"The '70s Marxia couldn't read", says Korkman.
"Maoes and trots and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more each other."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx is also able to approach without the ideological and political weights of the years back.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's idea world, like the other classes," says Korkman.
The United Nations requires war criminals to judge in Sri Lanka.
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes in the civil war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report charges both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as Tamil forces for war crimes.
A civil war in Sri Lanka is expected to have died of at least 100,000 people.
There's no precise data on the number of victims.
In particular, in the last months of the long war, the major armed forces' attack in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report is required.
Sri Lanka's armed forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual assault, which was equally likely to be victims of men like women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed themselves as fighters to force the minors and children to become fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct an investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice as foreign judges.
In the Yo test in England, she had to review social media in English.
On Wednesday there was a long foreign language, most of which had English in English.
More than 16,000 experiments tested their skills in England.
The test may have written the material from social media.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether the social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
In contrast, the English - language text of 150-250 may have been shown to the holder of the web page’s advisory service.
The site was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is responsible for the Finnish rest chair in Leelia.
He asked him how to help parents look at things also for young people.
The total number of subjects was four, of which one was to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them", estimates the third subject of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school English newspaper Mia Lybeck.
On the third issue was merely a quote from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth subject was nice, according to Lybeck.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school, we've been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and estimates the entire test of "melko normal".
In English or Swedish, the English test asked questions about texts that, for example, contained adaptations to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday a few large Russians (196 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The letters of the autumn continue on Friday, when the second domestic, i.e. Swedish or Finnish, test will take place.
In the upper secondary schools, the test is conducted normally, i.e. the expression of the wage earners does not affect it.
The Board of Inquists invites students to search in good time for appropriate connections to reach a trial meeting.
An additional period may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
In Oulu, the deal was robbed with a gun threat.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning a store was robbed in Kello's district of Kello.
According to the police, the kidnapper had dressed up in dark clothes and a face-to-face commando shop.
The man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money from the recipient.
We're investigating this case as a serious robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters from other parts of Helsinki, other parts of the family from elsewhere in Finland.
The demonstration against the government's operating decisions will be blocked by the police at the centre of Helsinki on Friday, predicting the police.
Prerequisite data show that up to tens of thousands of people arrive.
The members of the Associations of SAK, Akava and the JRC will meet at the Railway Director at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of the spirit.
On the other hand, it is up to the police in work not only to carry out alarm missions and other police operations, but also to ensure that the giant air is gone.
The roads leading to the train shall be closed from motor vehicles for the period from 9:30 to 14 p.m. for the period from 9:30 to 14 p.m.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
From Hakaniemi, traffic will be cut off from Kaisaniemi's traffic circle, from the west from Mannerheim to the west.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Chief Inspector Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least it seems that enough is enough.
I'm not going to take a stand for the police's work struggle.
Helsinki is in Kujala's view that there will be a demonstration of confusion about the support sections from elsewhere in Finland.
The police are not going to tell us.
"There's something coming, but we're basically gonna be fine with our own," Kujala says.
The police are calling upon us to avoid private car driving in the centre of Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic stop goes from Hakaniemi level to its core centre.
Standby traffic is expected from the beginning of the morning to the beginning of the evening.
With protestors arriving from elsewhere in Finland, Helsinki also has a lot of subscription buses coming to Helsinki.
They will not be released to the Railway Station.
As a matter of fact, the buses are going to be pretty far away from here.
We'll have to walk for the rest of the trip to the demonstration site," says Kujala.
The demonstration also stops public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there is also a positive side.
The issue of the flow of public transport, which is normally held at these large gatherings of people, will now be taken care of on a case by case basis.
The protestors have informed the police that Helsinki could become tens of thousands of opposition to government economic policy.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to be smooth.
It's a matter of normal working hours or unemployed people, ordinary citizens.
After all, the Finns are rational and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There are also local demonstrations from around Finland on Fridays.
Friday's spirit is in many ways exceptional - do you remember these varicellas and demonstrations?
The great demonstration organised by trade unions Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison of Finnish political history, says Professor Emeritus Martti Siiseinen, of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder that the ay-business protests.
If you didn't do that, it would raise your hands in front of the government, Siisiinen says.
A well-righted government has hit the fundamentals of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also those places that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hard work is lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that ay-move is really trying to get on their knees.
At the same time, the ay-move also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because, by no means, all employees are not supported by Friday's demonstrations.
The new one is now the steep division of which the demonstration of the spirit creates among the ones whose ay-business would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed who met across Finland showed their opinion at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If we were looking for a comparison for Friday's demonstration, it could be a big account for the unemployed, but it's from Murrrusstorti, said Siisiinen, which was organised in 1993.
In the middle of the deepest recession, the Murdors collected 20 000 unemployed.
Esko Ahon (central) the government tripped from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the wager organisations had never been as bad as it used to be in the time of Aho's mayor's government.
Now the difference between the government and the ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murstors.
Besides, there is now the most powerful government in Finland ever, says Siisiinen.
In this way, the present government coalition is still interesting that it is so strict right despite the words of the Basic Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labour movement at the time of the Yytsksk.
Several thousands of protestors are expected to be present on Friday.
The demonstration also stops public transport and possibly closes day-care centres and schools.
Despite the undistributed support of wage earners, it can become the largest in years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
There's a lot of them out there.
Traditionally, the protests of the ay movement in Finland have been quite calm - although the practices have been tightening up in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is law-abiding.
The speakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisiinen.
However, the late 1990s brought new winds.
The demonstration culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police were prepared to get pig shit on top of them.
The strike of firemen lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, visible strikes were pilots and pilots.
Remember these sheets and demonstrations?
In the 1970's, metal and electrical housings for the 1970s.
The most important sheets in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power and electrical strike in 1977.
Three-six thousand metal men took part in the strike of a metalman.
The strike was suspended on a proposal from the Board of Appeal for seven weeks from the end of the strike.
Metalmen received a 16 percent raise in wages.
In spring 1977, the electric strike lasted 49 days and caused power failure all over the country.
History in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met in the Parliamentary House, many of whom were made unemployed, to show their opinion on the work.
In 1998, firefighters stayed three months in 1998.
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU in 1994 and 1999.
In 1994, the police entered into an eggmeal in protests against the EU by farmers in protests against farmers.
“Siberia teaches, the EU stops,” said one of the attacks.
Espalia farmers took out tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU summit in 1999 also enabled farmers to protest and burn hay-pasts in front of the meeting site.
The nurses ceased to pay for 1983 and 1995.
Nurses stayed for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been resident in 1983.
The 1995 strike was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
The act threatened with a strike and a mass arrest of executives in 2007.
The threat of mass destruction finally came to a conclusion.
Doctors have diabetes since 2001.
"The doctors in the strike - escape", belonged to a statement of attacks by lacos doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centres and hospital doctors lasted for five months and gave a lively debate on how the strike could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' wages.
Students moving in 2013
About 5 000 students in favour of march for study support in Helsinki, from Senate to Parliamentary House in 2013.
Central police police police in Central criminal police will identify the backgrounds of a refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee refugee police to the Austrian police police in Austria, the Austrian police police police police in Austria, the Austrian police police police police police in Austria.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help to find out the backgrounds of the refugee herd registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the border of Germany a truck carrying 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Research and main responsibility are at the scene of the event in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala, Central Criminal Police Commissioner.
At the end of the strike, the other refugees who were travelling on a truck in Austria were more fatally killed.
All 71 passengers on board at that time apparently died by suffocating.
According to the Public Service on cooperation with the Austrian police, according to the Austrian State, the vehicle belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company conducts, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreigner, some 40-year-old man.
In Austria, there have been two arrests of Iraqiism in the field of human trafficking.
The story of the refugees, a former drug criminal and a dead-sacerererererer, a top-scluererer, five smugglers, five smugglers.
The chief smuggler's king, a violent boatman, a stylish missionary, and a cab driver who himself thinks he's a good guy.
For example, such people engage in trafficking in human beings into the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, and the editor, Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book The Death Travel Office will appear in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the transport of human beings, present proposals for solutions and present smugglers at different levels of business.
The H.S. introduces five of them.
I'm gonna get my bones off them right away.
Round islands on the eastern coasts of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunish people are heading for summer entertainment.
On its behalf, islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 kilometers away.
For the sake of comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers away.
There, in El Attaya village, lives in Emir, in a chain of burning captains and the father of six children.
The single islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
Emir has done that with a blue, ten-meter tree water for hundreds of times.
If a boat's full of feathers, it'll fit 40 people.
Emir makes about EUR 8 000 per trip after spending.
Emir has five assistants looking for her clients all over Tunisia.
The customers will arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of tunnels wanted to escape the dissatisfactions.
After that, the situation calmed down until again, following the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland in small groups on the One-Sari island.
Emir will accommodate them into empty houses for as long as he sees good.
The food is given so that the customers just and just stay alive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if the client stops the money in the middle, it's their problem.
Let's go to the water at midnight, we'll be swept in a lush.
The first night we drive off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and throw up in 20 metres of heights.
At the end of the mission, the human cargo has been broken in half an hour and Emir leaves on his return trip.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients up and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
He tells us in the book that once the police suddenly stopped him, he threw all his passengers across the border and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took customers one by one from the neck and threw them across the street," Emir says in the book.
The calmest passengers come south of Sahara.
According to his countrymen, he has to be sorry about this.
I'm gonna get my bones off them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
A regular cab driver.
Goran's a regular cab driver in Bologna, Serbia.
His cab's not very good, the starter motor is finally running, and anyway, it's seen its best days.
However, most important to Goan's customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Rovacha is a village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests around the center, men travelling without their families are accommodation in tents, lakes and abandoned cars, what everyone has now managed to find or build.
Other families living in the forest who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for reasons other than reason or for another.
Some may also stay in private dwellings, but it's a public secret.
Out of the woods, Goran will find most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walking distance in difficult lands, often mountain areas and in the dark.
As soon as they arrive in the region of Bologna, at the heart of a large area of human transport, people are tired of death.
The natives of Goran are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in the book.
"They say the truth once and that's enough," Goran says.
According to him, the Africans are trying to make a move.
Goran doesn't like that.
That's stupid nonsense all the way.
First, the price is agreed, for example, for 300 euros, then they drop to 200 and eventually they offer 150 euros.
Goran stresses himself to be a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells us that he is working at a cheaper cost than others and that he is taking a ride to the Hungarian border for only 50 euros per person.
It's about a quarter of a mile, most of it's nice on the highway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-time price.
Goran deserves about EUR 50 000 per year.
It's not a big sum for a smuggler, but in Serbia it's a really nice annual income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis should not be transported 12 km closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the shortcut, and he takes his travels a mile from the border.
Then he points the right direction to his customers and goes away.
At work in the work of loving - kindness.
A 35-year-old congolist is called the Confederate, and it's not just a nickname.
He does indeed have a Protestant church in Kampala, Uganda, where many believers who have fled from Congo, as well as a small center to help children refugees from Congo.
In addition to preaching, the Consignor is running a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of mercy.
It's important for the ambassador to look good.
He polishes his shoes several times a day and keeps in mind that the rubber lining of white beads gently bends under the lower waist of the jeans.
The ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car and his three motorcycles.
When the Ambassador does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client is calling at first from one of the five telephone numbers of the Consignor.
He advises that it will be worth coming to the border in the morning, hiding the money and rowing among the traffickers crossing the border.
In order to get the status of an asylum seeker or refugee to the Ugandan authorities, it is necessary to inform them that there are, for example, from the northern part of the war zones of the case, and that there have been forced to flee violence from their homes.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, the Consignor will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another identity card will be obtained.
It will help to contact the Consent in Uganda police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually the United Nations Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The ambassador knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He invoices each port separately: the lodging of an application to the Ugandan police costs approximately EUR 100, the processing of documents to a humanitarian organisation of about 150, and the migration process, for example, for a European country of EUR 4 500-7 000.
Foliota and ice-creams
Tom's a beginner smuggler, former drug offender.
Nictic Irish captain on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into the loops on their way to Britain.
He has an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers living in London who may not even know he's in the trafficking in human beings.
At night Tom and the cab driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from someone coming from the centre of Calais.
They're driving a highway A26 and they're trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want it, he's been sitting there for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs over its customers' motorcycles to the resting place where the dogs sleep before they cross the canal to Brits.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure it's on its way to England, not even the Netherlands, and cut off the protective protective safety device.
It's got to be done shut up so that the dogs don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's on the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client into an aluminium foil, similar to the one that is wrapped in the kitchen around a shirt or an oven.
It should prevent police heat scanners from detecting hideaways.
Some people use a sleeping bag that was left on the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the place hoping that the driver will not stop the smugglers at least before Britain.
King of Spermtors
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous human smugglers.
Ugorical Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed King of the Undisputed Explorations of the Mediterranean, who manages maritime routes from Turkey to Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Since the 1990s, Cyprus has been operating and has constantly developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has one competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he's only gonna demand the money.
One of the new methods is the luxury guardianship: Turkish ports are rented for recreational trips to take US or European families to tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are being loaded in full against the Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans who are transporting EUR 5 000 to 7 000 000 for the first time from Istanbul to a port and sea in Europe.
Customers are kept in human storage facilities, for example in old industrial plants until the time has come for them to leave.
Let's go somewhere towards the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the mark.
Once it is given, it must be quickly boarded.
Passengers must stay hidden under the cover throughout the entire journey.
The Navy can only observe how deep a ship swims, as no other signs of human population are visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers release and vomit, the better.
From one luxury trip after spending, they will receive approximately EUR 53 000.
He does not handle practical matters himself, but hire captains, recruiters, guards, housekeepers and other smaller factors to deal with the work for his own good.
During the summer, transport is organised by at least hundreds and Kyüčük makes millions of dollars.
He is believed to have bought through covert companies through land, pharmaceutical companies and over 100 apartments he rents.
In 2011, Muammer Küçük was arrested at the same time as the Congressman of the Turkish Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: Death travel agency book will appear here, not next week.
American Olympic Olympics from America in his book about their illness and becoming a prostitute from being a prostitute in his book of being a prostitute in his illness and becoming a prostitute.
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-meter runner, has attracted attention in the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells about ending his career and driving his career into a prostitute.
The Sports Illustrated magazine published a breakdown of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton finished his career at Sydney's Olympics.
He came to the top of the race and ran for the second time.
But he was panicking in the finals.
At the beginning of the day, he rushed to the top and defended his leadership with a country run.
150 meters before the paint, however, his power fell.
He fell to the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself across the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later, it became apparent that Favor Hamilton suffered a bilateral disorder of mind.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney's races committed suicide, and he himself felt enormously successful pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The partner had no financial problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with other men.
He also overcame his husband to accept his action.
Mr. Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR 450 an hour.
He'll tell you that he's spent his money on luxury life.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of being prostituted was also that he wanted similar adrenaline games as he had been in competition for public sport.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from bilateral mental disorder.
The double life of the ex-stars became apparent at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was the last of Sydney's Olympics during the world's statistical cycle.
The world champion was delighted when the alliance put Norway's ski court in the direction of "Indirect".
In the opinion of at least one of its colleagues, the Norwegian ski-tooking Petter Northug has exceeded the compatibility limits.
In the summer and autumn last year, a sports agreement has been reached between the respective Nordic Ski Federation and the Norwegian Skiing Association.
Although the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than any other athlete, it has not been good enough for a multi-time world champion and an Olympic winner either.
The conclusion of the treaty was that the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to close the Northug off the world Cup of the coming season.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance put the skiman in charge.
"Thank you for showing your spine", Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the union sponsor," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and the Margu is about money.
You know, he'd probably like to be part of a country team in the season so he could advertise his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent a union that will also take care of future generations, and he will not give one athlete in his solos.
At the same time, he recalled that the alliance has given Northug both financial and other privileges for many years.
I know because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because it's the best.
On Tuesday he published his own publication, which assured me that he would like to be brave in Norwegian colours next season in the world cup as well as then in World Cup and Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals in his career, two of which are gold.
He was involved last winter in the team that won the post-intercom.
The shield day of the stake-overs will also be spent in Northern Finland in Northern Finland.
On Thursday, 25 September, there are places to be placed in different restaurants and shops, which have been issued with the Paistin Translation shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland’s high level of food expertise and to lower the threshold for the departure of the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants that are controlled and classified by an impartial operator are located all over Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of thyroid restaurants and the organization.
In northern Finland the day will be held in Vaasa, a restaurant in Foundation and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, the Old Town restaurant is participating in the holiday event.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
It has been decided to make an organisation one of the most significant international events taking place in the same day around the world.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhahabányi magazine: Applyed to the Chancellor of Justice on the establishment of the district reception centre of Kauhahava.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to establish a refugee reception centre at the premises currently owned by LSK Business Park Ltd.
According to the complaint, the region is still permanently located in the critical infrastructure of the crisis period, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Specials Networks Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building assembly would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the Defence Forces may have interest in the territory and the airport of the former Airport School, which have not also had an impact on the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
The report states that there have been negotiations for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport for the last two years.
This has been discussed, inter alia, with Mr Jussi Niinistön (ps.) and Mr Arto Rädy, Secretary of State of the Ministry of Defence.
The person declares to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter for the principle of opposition to the reception centre, but that the planned place in the former military area is wrong.
The district government of Kaowava dealt with the reception centre issue last Monday.
June: The situation of Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
The government means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary conditions, Niinist comments to journalists in the evening after meeting with the chairmen of all Parliamentary parties in Mänttyniemi.
According to the president, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all participants.
He considers it valuable that the Government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss confidentially on fundamental issues.
Especially in these times, when we face great challenges, we are facing major challenges.
According to that, the situation in Syria and the actions of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic region.
It is hopeful that this will be the case for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it has an impact on the situation in Ukraine and continues to have tension over the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to what it says, the NATO issue was also discussed.
The President did not take a position on the labour market situation.

Researcher: Sipilä takes a high risk of risk.
According to Sipilä, various channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio phones are one channel among others.
Such a direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This is not going to stay the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
The song did not yet want to assess how often the repeated practice of Prime Minister's television and radio calls would become.
According to Sipilä, talks may not always be transmitted to Yle's channels in the future.
If other channels report to the channel, then we'll see.
We're going to use this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the situation of Finland’s economy is so serious that it requires that television and radio services be kept to citizens.
This whole thing we are talking about is quite complicated and requires a longer explanation.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 in both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Sipilni takes a big risk risk.
The Media Researcher hopes that Sipilä's television phone will not tell you more about the general government's inward turn.
Is it the intention to take more strictly into account the right to decide on the public debate and to refuse the public debate on the presentation of questions? asks Professor Anu Koivu, of Stockholm University?
It is recalled by the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin's recent comment that he does not follow the media agenda and that he does not allow it to define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be interrelated.
The pain understands that commercial media is upset by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be strange if the media field wouldn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting matters in democracy.
The role of the media representatives is, by definition, to aim to ensure that the political agendas are not taken on board.
According to the experience, the phone is a major risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, Sipil would have to bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Are there any more available today for what we've heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different tone, in a different way or in different words, or to say something new?
The snake says that if there is only more of the same old, you must wonder why such a large gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Yle also takes a risk in that sense, in the case of not a specific situation, but a routine speech among others.
The risk is that Yle will be entrenched into a communication between politicians or the parliament and the government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interest or general policy.
A soft bet from the black bets of the black bet.
In the future speech of Sipil, it is also important that what the Prime Minister does not say is highlighted by the media researcher.
Tonight we should look closely at what Sipila is missing and what is not, says Heikki Six, Research coordinator of the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Moon, the TV is a clever bet from Sipil, because this is how it can bring its own vision to the point of view without sounding.
This message will be made available to the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The wing skips the media and speaks directly to the people.
The risk, however, is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because there is no way to put any further questions.
According to the moon, it is very important how Sipilä appears on TV... how the sweat flows, whether it shakes hands or not.
He compares Sibiha to the father figure that now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do it well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government were to know something about it, because here a person like he's talking directly to another person.
This (United Kingdom President Barack) Obama and partners regularly pursue their activities.
Very exceptional, very exceptional.
Erkka Railo, a political scientist, considers the Prime Minister's speech to the public to be truly exceptional.
According to him, it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The director thinks that the Prime Minister would like to make Finns more generous to the tensions that are ahead of us.
On Friday, wager organisations will organise a protest and strike against the government's activities.
On Twitter, President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki says that Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow us to discuss the speech.
The President of the SDP Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces that he will challenge Sipilä's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
About six months from the election.
You can't hide in the end, Rinne writes on Twitter.
The boy on the 9-year-old runaway has been found on Tampere.
The boy was in good condition at the moment we found him.
THE PHONE AND MONEY, the son's father updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finnish Police Department also confirms the matter to the press.
The kid went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later, he was never contacted again.
My father thank all those who have helped me look for help.
Thank you for the ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed closer to 15,000 times which is an incredible balance in such a short time period.
Finnish UFC star disappointed young people in violent fading: You are at a time of anger.
Márkhani, a punishable freelancer, has published a video on Facebook, where young people are particularly attracted to immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Markhani had to give a strong talk against young street fightings.
Amikhani, born in Iran and reached Finland at the age of five, has so far won both of his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Mikhani tells me that he received a message asking me to check a Instagram account.
There are videos on the account where young people fight with extreme violence.
My past tells me that she is disappointed with the wildness of young people.
26-year-old Amirkhan has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking the ground, sitting on the other side and knocking in plainly without thinking about any of the consequences of this when you make videos of this kind, my Markhan is updating.
It's hard to stand up anymore.
Some of the young people in the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos to social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and Finnish young people.
The fact is, you're fighting around the street all the time.
You do so by making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, Turkish Mimarkhan reminds me of the Turkish.
Amishani recalls that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become quite gross.
It's a little hard, boys, more to defend you.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests for a long time here.
That's a little different way of thanking you for being here, says Amirhani.
My husband says that young people remember when they're close.
If they ever end up being a target for racism, then you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Think about it a few times before you go in there, guys.
The mishap says that violent action is giving birth to racism.
In the meantime, you'll get the hate I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad, and you won't make it any better, Mishrkhan decides.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Ly: Decisions on Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday: decisions decisions - Ly: Decisions decisions decisions on Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday Monday on Monday Monday on Monday Monday
On Twitter, Mr Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, says that on Monday the employees' organisation will consider its position on behalf of the STC on the alternative savings it has proposed.
Lauuri Lyly commented on Twitter on a proposal from the JRC.
On Wednesday, the STKC told the government that it would present its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) to reach the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Plan, believes that the Government will adopt a proposal if the SAK, STK and Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest wager organisation SAK improve its previous position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, commented on this issue in a word on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyny, the SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that active agreements are needed instead of coercive laws.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not valid for the SAK.
In the past, the negotiations were terminated by the SAK when it refused to commit itself to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: High-mindedness is threatening to go off - "It feels like it's a little funny to put on a fist"
I mean, it's kind of funny to put on your fist, if there's already a reconciliation paper in your pocket, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The sensations vary from one person to another in the payee camp.
Are we supposed to call on the government to repeal or to agree with it?
On Monday, SAK’s allies broke down holy hatred for the government of the kingdom.
The whole of Finland was threatened to close down.
The skin also spread to the pouts.
OAJ, a trade union for teachers, threatened the closure of schools and day care centres.
Tuesday OAJ canceled: no schools or daycare would be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STKC president of the Centre for Staff, was in agreement.
He stated that he had kept in contact with the government and that Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) had called for an alternative presentation to be a 5% productivity bonus.
Mr Sture Fjäder (Kok) rushed immediately to announce that his piece of paper is already ready.
At first, there was no yard at all.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the Joint Directors told them to stop the country on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a five-percent profit gap target.
There is no wonder that the Palestinian PSC has relations in order with the Sipilä Government.
On the right hand of Koolan, Director of Social Impact of the STK, Jukka Iineus, formerly served as special assistant for the Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
As a matter of fact, Palola described that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Slightly or not, however, the output of Palola took a little off the Finnish stand-alones, whose circulatory is the ACP Marko Pieainen (sd).
I mean, it's kind of funny to put on your fist if there's a piece of matching paper in your pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Added information about Lylyn's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again".
Russia's President Sergei Naryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
According to the Russian Duma President Sergei Naryshkin, Mongolia is better than Finland.
In Mongolia capital city, Ulan Battor, the General Assembly of Etyj has started the House of Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments about the July Helsinki Assembly meeting.
At that time Finland did not allow the European Union to arrive at a meeting of political politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced by the European Union - a matter which the President will take to remind journalists of the journalists of.
In our opinion, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again, Naryshkin's print by Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access had also been prevented.
Sanktios are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared a political suicide.
So Naryshkin continued to listen to Finland with a compliment and thanking Mongolia for "industry organisation".
I am sure that the parliamentary Assembly will be conducted constructively and with positive results, unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia realizes that parliamentary dialogue should not be an obstacle.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (Kok), who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation.
The lock hits the real playoff mirror: "Put tight"
The Tappara and the Lock will continue today in Hakamets for bull days when both of them are on fire on the second day of the second day.
Janne Lahti expects us not to see a real festival tonight in Hakamets.
Tappara went to Kuopio yesterday to dig 3 or 2 times a breakout from KalPa.
The rise was male, because last year's silver team was at its worst two-tone loss position.
The lock Tuesday was more like a bulldozer.
As a guest of Blues, which started the Iron Hall with a guarantee, there were round zero points, and the losses were also 2-3.
Hard game, goals tightly, if any of them play the same game as last year, the Slugger Janne Lahti expected the events on the company's pages.
Tappara has become quite a playoff presser for ramen people.
In fact, during the second period of the previous year, Tappara has been cutting off the finals of the Lock just in the middle of the previous series.
On both occasions, a decisive seven-mat has been required for a solution.
In the last period, the Log took the series into the box already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next side and past.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups except for the goal guards.
The cashiers that both sides rejected yesterday will be able to get a holler today.
The killing of Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolskin between the mouth-tocks.
Face: In a Ässs, a bad play is going on.
Sports director Solola scripted a follow-up to Mr Rautakallio, writing from Tampere, Santtu Silvennoinen.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Ballone scripted a Rocky movie where he himself played the main part.
The explorer set up sensational styles for Apollo Creed, a heavyweight world champion of the world.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost a title fight.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Solola's script was written by Pori for a restless ashtray story.
The name and wood-dressed pope went into the surprise of all of SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough bottomers like Rocky.
There was white Indian, Pori Matt, and Pele Pelto.
In the fall games, players dyed their heads red and cut the ironies.
I'm happy to become a blonde.
JP Jalo, the great TV director, called Coach Neumann.
He took the winning silver.
She was one of the heroes.
author Dévola believes that the news of this period will work in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as head of sports for Ässi has built a bakery for evil boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have stunned these guys in a faraway like Rocky's pig clothes at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Vitainen, Juha Kilholman and Matti Kuparinen's privileges are in some other way than in the field of play.
The hope that Rocky VI has forgotten the main role played by Pekka Raukatalio.
Karri Stone has crucified Raukaallion Sean Connery.
Raukaalio is the most clumsy performer of Rocky's manuscript as if Connery had been in the original of 1976.
There is nothing more Rocky than a nickname in the Iron Chamber.
The game philosophy of iron iron control is not part of the rushing and small scale.
He appreciates a hard game, but there is a different thing about playing hard like a pig.
Over the past few years, the Ässien Garrett Staffford had a fight with the head of Jere Karjalainen, the killer.
He got two to ten minutes from the judges, but Raukatallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute.
We only play those who deserve it.
I don't accept such a game and it's not part of the ace, and the hot-fired Rautakalio woke up after the game to the nation of Satan the Commonwealth.
This season's team has been strangely built.
There are trains, veterans, cops and conspires.
There are virtually no key players in the game age.
No wonder the head coach's been complaining about the skill drive.
How much have you been able to influence the game acquisitions, Pekka Raukatallio?
The recent events affected procurement and unfortunately the situation on the market was quite narrow, Rautakalio replied diplomaticly.
Under the surface, the dynamometer.
In 1953, Raukatallio is obviously interested in moving to the Hope place as a sports bomb.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance balance between the balance sheet of the ace of the three leagues of the season is equal to a loss of a total of 1-6.
I would not have liked to have written the extension part of the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa's mother.
Olga Temonen exposes that if he had met his husband Kauka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under his husband's guidance.
Yes, I'm gonna play my husband's friend's mother in a movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, acting and producer Olga Temonen's laughing at me.
He has been married to Apinna ex-bassist and director Tuukkas Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but for the first time Olga is acting under the direction of Tuuka.
The role of Olga in the early years of Akilanna's film You and I have a drummer Sipe Santapuki's mother, Sirkka.
Sirkka tszep and supports his son, although his father Risto (representing Lorenzo Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my true example Sirka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Kaukka that he trusted me with the role he played.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has approached a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone and talked to me about it.
The circus has done so much for you.
We've been through a lot of different angles through their history.
Unfortunately, Sirkka also understands that drama is a drama, and the truth may have to be slightly coloured.
Olga points out that Sirkka was almost the only person in Heinola who blindly believed that the aid would become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a lie and a very tough one.
It was a pretty small probability that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some kind of inspiration, and he was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard a lot about Tuukala from this youth before the movie plans.
However, there have been little different between parents ’ stories.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much parents really know what you were doing?
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Heinola’s infamous scepter Tuuka.
Olga was a decent and kind girl who wouldn't have had anything to do with Tuuka's movie.
Mostly, he could have had a secret crush on him.
Olga says he's been working so hard with Kauka over the last 10 years that a big joint project won't be afraid.
Everything's always been great.
Now the whole production team is starting for a month in the descriptions of Heinola.
However, the couple who live in Italy are often planning to drive home because of their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take the whole Heinola for a month.
They've been really warm to meet us, asking only what streets and when to get rid of them.

The budget for the Iron Sky film by Timoresola is EUR 17 million for the film The Coming Race.
The photographs will start in Belgium in October.
Timo Vuorensola, director, begins with a picture of Iron Sky 2 in October Belgium.
Scifi film Iron Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive play movie in Finland all time with its budget of EUR 17 million.
In the past, the title of the most expensive film in Finland has been to Jalmari Helander Big Game.
The Angry Birds animation will rise once it is completed also by Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over EUR 100 million.
In October the films of the film produced by Timorensola and Tero Kaukoma will begin at AED Studios, near Antwerp, in October and take eight weeks.
Timo Vurensola, director, is leaving for Belgium next week.
The guy's not scared.
I've been really sick.
I have such a relaxed file script because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
While the time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, he'll tell the paper.
The initial budget for the film was 8 to 10 million, but as the script was developed, the budget grew as well.
The budget is big, but it's a big shot.
However, 100 million people would be involved in the film, because each aspect and efficiency are so expensive.
Now it's so tight that there's nothing to find.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today on Wednesday a mass finance campaign and a crowd loan with an annual rate of 4-8%.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
After two years at the latest, the company will pay back the loan.
The action film shows, among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.

Big logos go back to their shirts to their shirts. Big logos go back to their shirts.
Trends in breasts have recently decorated large logos.
A while ago, a fashionable dresser was considering clear and big logos like Crocs in a console.
Advertising the label of a hood or a t-shirt was seen as some kind of junt.
It's not just the times that change.
Sport has become the true megatrend of the fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports patterns such as Adidas and Nike.
And as often as before, the funny and trendy border is a shame: if something is right, it starts to turn into iron and cell.
First came the norm for the core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, where the trends were surprised by the most boring basic clothes as possible, as well as by the means of separating from the mass.
Now, instead of turning on the grey base, we've already put on the base of the closet buried in the net, which the manufacturer's logo has before us.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' IDs are raves, favorite team cards, and New York Yankees' flags have made a return to the regret fashion.
The edge of the tracks start to mock the lowland Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The tradition seems to be moving from sports labels to luxury brands as well.
For example, the chest of Versace's viscosity makes clear what the sign of clothing is about.
Would you be willing to introduce your logos when you're dressed?
The Russian politician published evidence that I wasn't stuck in a tank hatch.
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, Russia Arms Expo 2015.
In recent days, Russian media has spread colorful claims that the Russian emergency department had to remove the large size of Zotovia's tank lock for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published a picture on his own public Facebook page where he seems to be crying about the door of a tank vehicle in a very good mood, and not on the basis of their images, it's about getting drunk or getting angry at anything.
This is bullshit.
Let's start with that I didn't go into a combat tank, but it was a train-run tank BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel Colonel, and I have served in Ural.
I went in there, I looked around and came out in peace, Zotov said Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I definitely didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov explained to the Russian army's TV channel that he was a former professional soldier in the exhibition.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I was curious about our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the train tanks, Zotov promised me.
Zotov also called it a fool for a writer who wrote it.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but nothing like I'm stuck in a tank, it didn't happen, he said Russka and sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photo of the claim of aging has been published, although over a few days, a total of 50 000 people were present at the arms exhibition.
The argument about Zotov's getting drunk started on the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told to hang out a tank lock while trying to get out and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he got off his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published an extension in which the organisers of the exhibition explained their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his great size, was simply delayed when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said the coordinator of the exhibition Aleksandr Pisarevski to Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kitilä well of Agnico Eagle Finland, a Canadian mining company.
The grubbed process water has leaked its so-called rich sandland stream.
According to the company, measures have been started to correct the leakage.
Alla has neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water in the foaming process.
In general, water is either pumped for reuse as process water, or it is authorised to run through the surface light field into the environment.
The figure was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of the leak water meets the current terms of the permit.
The rest of the substance didn't leak into the environment.
The bleeding was found during the inspection round Monday morning.
The bleeding has not been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures in the pool.
The company will inform you that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Dansk Kukoppamaski: IMF warns against cutting too much too much pressure on the IMF to warn against being over-cut too much too much too much.
Finland's country report, published today by the IMF, is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization packaged structural reforms to cover Finland in order to cope with economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction in overtime and paid holidays contributed to Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be necessary for the whole contractual system as well as for the protection of unemployment.
According to Mr. Pasi Kuopopamama, the main co-founder of Danske Bank, the structural reforms are in agreement, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of useful communication for government activities, but on the other hand there are also some warning words about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopomaski says to the Economics.
In the opinion of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates Finland's economic growth of 0.4 per cent for this year, which will rise to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske is expecting growth to remain low this year in his new cyclical forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
This morning Statistics Finland reported that total output was in a small increase in the summer, says Kuopomamäki.
Less attention has been paid to reduced confidence in the industry or to other so-called softer measurements.
However, there are only a few percent of the decimal places.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who died in July under Sapul Iwata, started his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwa led to Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic in the face of the game industry.
For example, Iwata responded successfully to the depression of the Wii console.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishma is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishma is a safe choice to follow Iwatan's footprints, evaluate Ace Research's analyst, Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishma is to take Nintendo with strong involvement in mobile games, but so that it does not eat bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
There are increasingly and more and more and more minor asylum seekers from asylum asylum seekers and asylum seekers who are asylum seekers who seek asylum seekers who are asylum seekers who are asylum asylum seekers who are asylum asylum seekers who are less and more and more and more and more vulnerable asylum asylum asylum seekers alone in Finland
In February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service recognised that even hundreds of children who have entered the country will disappear annually.
It has been reported, among other things, on the website of SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, by the Swedish Immigration Service, that hundreds of minors are lost annually in the country.
Inspector Juha Kannelmaa of the Finnish Immigration Service tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much do applicants disappear in the "landless" year?- In Finland a total of 156 minors' asylum applications were made in 2013 in the same year.
They lost nine.
In 2014, 196 applications were made and 11, Kannelmaa reported their disappearance.
On the basis of the disappearance, it may be that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the case in Finland and to be returned to the responsible country for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, the total number of asylum seekers in Finland was 3651, of which 134 applications were rejected because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so the adult asylum seekers disappeared during the last 123 years, he says.
Is the volume growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for minors who have come alone.
The total statistics on minors missing this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons, he will stress.
What happens to those who have received the appeal decision?
For example, will they be lost for example on "the blind labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service because the police are responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, but Kannelmaa stresses.
Minister of State Petteri Orpo (Kok) has been concerned about the growing number of those seeking to enter the country that is not registered.
He has taken action on this.
At the EU Ministerial Conference on the issue of refugee matters, Orpo, who spoke on Monday about practical measures to ensure that asylum seekers flow through Sweden to Northern Finland through Sweden.
Nina Mikkene sells Tim Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s equipment for television and radio production is now being sold for sale by media pioneer, who has lost his job.
Mikkoinen's spouse Nina Mikkene sells in Huuuu.net equipment, which was at one of the most advanced professional tools in the sector.
The online announcement was the first to be reported on the website to Iltamacasin.
Today, a large part of the equipment has remained under technological progress.
In the digital media world, television shows are no longer described for Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikonen is still confident that we can find those who are interested.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that up-to-date, but these are also needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbys - collectors and individual studio builders, Nina Mikkonnen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move away from their current Myrskylä home.
There's nothing we can do to bring all the goods with us.
I'm just beginning to think about what's going on.
Now I'm starting, Nina Mikonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio equipment.
It is clear from the findings of recent strokes that a long career man will not return to work anymore.
Nina Mikkonen notes that only goods and equipment are now sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was filed during the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box shop to pick up films and other materials from Myrskylä.
Traffic is threatening to get worse thinking traffic is likely to get worse: Metro and railway wagons can stop by all Friday.
Metro and tram drivers are today deciding whether to expand their efforts on Friday's demonstration of demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the railway and tram services only for a Friday's demonstration.
During the afternoon, it will resolve whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief trustee Pekka Hirvonen says that the threat is great in the field.
The operation of night and shift cuts is a bad start for drivers, so the government's plans to cut the parts into opposition.
Hilvonen wonders that standing up for the whole day is, however, a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stop by Friday, public transport in the capital area will be almost completely halted.
According to VR data, trains do not travel between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on Friday.
On Friday, there is no movement between or far-off traffic.
Trains departing early in the morning will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left to the front end.
The members of the ACP will be absent from work on Friday morning from 3:00 a.m. on Saturday at 3:00 a.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by a superior power, the HSL informant Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says that HSL can't tell us exactly what bus tours are going on Friday.
On Friday, 11-13 a.m., the civil servants' organisations will organise a major demonstration on the Helsinki Railway Agency.
Aftonblad: Aftonblad: Hungarian police police used tear gas to combat refugees against the refugee refugees.
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make progress in Europe, reports AP.
According to Skys, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
Even refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water tanks against people.
Muslim boy was arrested in a school in Texas, in Texas, the teacher thought a school of his own-made watch was a bomb bomb.
In the U.S.A., Ahmed Mohammed, 14 years old, has been arrested after the teacher held him at school for his own-tech watch as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News he just wanted you to meet him on your electronics record.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock would look like a bomb.
The police were called to the scene, and the situation ended in the end that the boy was taken to the youth detention cell in the cuffs.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed at any time anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it is still possible that the boy is accused of committing a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had reported that the watch had appeared to be a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was definitely composed of a circuit board and a digital screen between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday, and Mohamé was punished for three days in forced school.
His father is angry about the case and the American Islamic Council in the country wonders if the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain - Director of Labour refused to sing national song.
In song God is asked to protect the Queen, but Corby is the opponent of the Monarch.
The criticism of the right-wing press has also been agreed by the representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people, thought about the Labour National Representative Kate Green in the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have used a song.
The Memorial was held last night to honour the fight against Germany's Luftwaffe by the British Air Force's pilots in 1940.
In its official opinion, the Labour Party defends Corbyni and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in great debt of gratitude to the heroism of the pilots of the Royal Air Force.
He (Corby) stood honorably silently during the national song, the opinion was highlighted.
Corbyn's election as party leader has divided the rows in the lab.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral repression, end savings and increase public spending.
For the first time today, Corbyn is supposed to be a party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron climbed around the weekend on Twitter on Twitter with Corbyn's choice as party leader.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister's reference to our own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota is still unclear, the father of the family was waiting for a court case.
Southke Mintonka police have been investigating the family death that happened in Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
Five families were found dead in their homes on 10 September and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the family's father, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After the first shot at the gravel of his wife and three children, Brian Short killed himself in the garage in the house.
Days that have already died for days.
They found a family after they were worried about the absence of children at school.
On the basis of this notification, the police went to the house at the inspection visit and found a huge house on the other side of the family.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been killed for days.
Millions and successful company.
The investigation of Southke Mintonka's chief, Michael Sitari, is still ongoing.
The cause of the bleeding is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property on the social media site of AllNurs.com.
In 2014, in StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site each week.
I've been offered 50 bids for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'm selling a company, but not yet.
The success was reflected, among other things, that the Short's family bought a house in Greenwood in 2011 for $2 million a day.
The house is advertised in Zillow as a car collector's dream: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also a garage sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, which offers different prepping courses, had sued him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there were no disturbing comments on the Short site, and therefore they had lost their customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loiri offered me cake coffee coffee.
In addition, the three owner's prize was awarded at the destination event at the Finnish Hippos month's horse owner prize.

The amazing gesture that's going to come from the NHL star - "The gift made by all the greatest athletes of all time"
The Grand Star of Montreal, P. K. Subban, has donated $10 million (approximately EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital for the children of Montreal hospital.
According to the health information provided by the hospital, it is the most recent individual donation made by athletes to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made an agreement with the Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million a year ago.
Thus, Subban’s contribution amount is significantly higher than its nine million dollars per year.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a lobby bearing his name from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have, in the first place, benefited significantly from local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a sum of money for another large hospital in the city to receive a PET scanner for cancer research purposes.
The Japanese coffee can order the wife for the night of the evening serving the food with only bikinis and a essay on her head.
The theme coffees are a tough thing in Japan.

Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the equipment was started to be equipped for attacks against the security of vehicle information security.
In addition, the Automated Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector, reports the Communication published by Intel.
The board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and planning recommendations for advanced cyber-security solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of the best practices in cybersecurity.
The Company will continue to update the report on the basis of the ASRB's findings.
Gartner, an international ICT research and consultation firm, estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, generate and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of each car connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in information processing.
Ford Focus RS costs approximately EUR 52 000 in Finland.
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as the moon rises up.
Finally, the car begins to be also in sight in Finland.
Ford released RS information now that the car world's eyes are on Frankfurt's auto show.
Ford's new four-wheel RS accelerates by a 2.3-litre, 350-Hero-power engine of 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed of 2.6 km per hour.
There is also an interesting price, which is initially reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell us when it comes to information.
The favorite mark Kia introduced two new developments at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition - such is the new Sportage and Optima.
The second generation of Sportage, which Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever-growing street-ground market, is certainly more important than the two new ones.
The new European design director, Gregory Guillaum, created under the leadership of the Guillaum, is more round than ever before.
A quarter of the time has come to this place, and the car is more efficient than the air.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but it has added a 1.6-litre turbo that develops 177 horses.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We will have to wait a little longer, as the new Sportage will arrive in the spring of 2016.
Even before the shift of the year, they've got new Kia Optimats into our country.
Suddenly, the news doesn't look different, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of higher middle class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
The building is equipped with 1,7-litre turbodiesel and 2,0-litre petrol engines.
The next summer, the speeds were high when the Optima GT, equipped with a 2,0-lit turbo engine, arrived next summer.
At the same time, the sale of Optima Farmer will begin with its arrival.

Kim Kardashian's maternity style again, now we're looking at breasts.
True-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives topics to one after another.
She presents her pregnancy clothing and her breast equipment fairly in her sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 p.m., when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian, a husband from Kanye West's gig with her sister, Kourtney Kardashian.
Mother's mother's dress is transparent to the breasts.
It reveals the skin-colored bra under the dress when lightning lights flash.
The last time Kardashian was dressed up in an amatenic maternity ward, he visited his friend's dinner party in New York only a few days ago.
Black superstitious boots that highlighted the importance of honor.
The third special maternity uniform is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the opening act had its pregnancy births.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you are lonely, the competition is terrible.
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to take a look at the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary on Speeding Dolls (Speaking dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues spoke about a clean model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine gathered the six hard truth about Leloup behind the scenes.
Each season begins with nothing.
Even if during the previous season you would have been in the costumes of top designers, the new season will start again on casting.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for work with hooks.
Models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that the place of residence is a room or apartment in which fashion houses house their model.
If you are very young, and your mother can't travel with you, it can't be too difficult to be lonely.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
It's not just the density of one sort.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
Design models and designers are always together and operate as a support network.
When fashion weeks run out, the difference is bad.
Models want to be in this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but they are afraid that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
The models want to be their own person, too.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But in the work of the model you can also express yourself.
Models at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York is currently having fashion plans where designers will reveal their model for next year.
In style, modified by Roope Salmine, filmed by an unknown Audilanta musician.
Roope Salmine performs Antti Laatalaa, the founder member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta Group.
Lautala was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtaen, but resigned from the band in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me because I'm a 26-year-old rapper, and in this movie I'm playing 16-year-old guitarist, Salmine laughs.
I've never wanted to see a real Antti before the photographs, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people from that group, so I think it's good that I just learn from his music style from a video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
A man who can trust Roope Salminen and Dogs is not going to play the role.
The punk masters come from a man's natural nature.
The stars, in the punk episode of the stars, must have been seen by many before, and also if you've ever been to our gigs.
Our presence has never been a little bit of a time, but we'll always be on our way.
In 1993-2004 the main actors of the beautiful film by Tukka Temos, who played the bass, were released today.
A nuclear force that became familiar to the band's audience is being presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumuli Sipe Santa Santa present Teppo Manner, singer from Toni Witasta Tattu Sinisalo based Tuukka Temo Temo Iiro Panula.
Roope Salmine gave me a tip about his coming nest last night when he told me in Snapchat mysteriously that he would prepare himself for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published a picture of his new story yesterday in Instagram, which he has had to do for the film.
Roope, seen earlier in the mustache, has driven his face to silropos, and dyed his brown hair black.
Psych psychologist counsel: This is how you tell your children about refugees from refugees.
In recent days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell the child about the situation of refugees who are seeking Europe.
Or should I at least tell you at all?
It does not have to be spoken with violence, a member of the SP crisis group, a psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, not let them watch the news alone.
Small children can't always understand what they've seen, and it can go around thinking and anxiety, he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news about refugees or has heard about it elsewhere, it is worth speaking to him.
It is a good thing to have a conversation about the child's basis and listen carefully to what he is asking for.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones the parent thinks he's afraid of.
You shouldn't be afraid of anything, even if you're upset and afraid of yourself.
The younger child is closely following the conduct of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, they also feel that they are safe.
Major children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
Parents should be happy to speak with them if they are concerned about the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well at all.
Parents, together with children, can think about how our family views this.
In the end, do we think that the world is a safe or secure place, at the end of the day?
Parents may also have different farming perspectives - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand: If the family is also talking about difficult matters, the child will get a model of how to deal with the difficulties that come to life.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social Psychologist Janne Viljamaa: " Teach your child to help the weaker".
Your own powers at the end?
You may still be a good parent to your child.
Verminable Ballsalamaa is difficult to control.
Perttu Põhjola got hit in the middle of the strike by Apila Ballsalama.
It was only open to profits and seconds, until a collapse occurred at the end of July at the end of Tampere.
Since the slave fell to the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a safe period of time from his veterinarian.
The explanation for a step-by-step was made clear in the observation.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not the least of its head, but the tearing of it required two drug courses.
Since Apilan Ballosalma had to be on a light move, the North says it was a good idea to be surprised at the last race of the horse.
It was in Turku at its record time another SE-mama after Taruntuvus.
Apilan Pillosalma was under pressure from a break when it was possible to drive normally only a few weeks away.
Those things at the end of the little bending of attention were understandable," The North says.
The coach assumes that a fair competition made the slaves sharp.
I'm sure the horse's score moved on from it, and I hope it's even more balanced.
Apilan Ballalama has been so-called humorous horses.
When it's not fun, it could have been thrown fat without any illness.
On the day of the day, the slaves have, on the other hand, removed the lightning rule that the opponents have been wonderful.
At the speed of the match-offers will not be able to do anything to Pillosalma, from which even warm rides are off.
The hopes of the north are a pesis run in the Vermo.
However, the difference is how Apilan Ballsalama agrees with it.
It's kind of hard at the time of departure, and it might even fall under and like that.
I hope that the slave would be more calm than Turku's leaving.
Apilan Pillosalma is capable of coming out of the ring when he's in good condition, and we're going to drive out of victory with it, coach permission.
This is why you can't get rid of any corrupt iPhone programs.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be deleted in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports Tim Cook Buzzfeed's interview with the company's CEO.
Apple iPhone has a series of programs that are relatively rare to use: for example FaceTime calls, Lehtikioskio, Health, Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkis come to mind.
The latest addition to these programmes is Apple Watch, who entered an emergency update on iPhone phones, even though it is necessary only for Apple smart owners.
According to the Cook, removing Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications have been linked to another iPhone.
If they are deleted, it may cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook your supplement.
So according to Cook, Apple is investigating it, because the company does not want to waste memory space on users' iPhone phones.
The euro area inflation slowed to 0.1 per cent in August to 0.1 per cent of GDP in August.
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, the EU Statistical Authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices slowed down the downward trend in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised the estimate for a couple of weeks to a slightly downward trend of 0.2 per cent.
The inflation rate was 0.2% in July.
The so-called underlying inflation decreased by 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for underlying inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper in the last month than one year ago.
The average inflation rate for the whole of 28 EU countries in the EU was at zero in August.
In July, the rise increased by 0.1 per cent.
The highest number of euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, the lowest rate of inflation was 1.9 per cent, which was the lowest in prices.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU harmonised index.
The euro area's inflation remains a long way from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB) which is a two-percent increase in prices over the medium term.
The ECB estimates an average inflation rate of 0.1 per cent for the euro area on average for this year.
Next year, the rise will rise to 1.1%, the central bank will anticipate its new inflation forecasts as announced at the beginning of September.
The United States Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy on monetary policy.
The United States's next recession will start at a speed of less than one year, but more certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed is again starting to raise interest rates for a long time.
And in the financial markets, the deficit will begin before the next recession begins.
Fed has suggested that it will start with interest payments possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Therefore, the next recession can press ahead at the fastest time by next autumn and as a series of courses on the financial markets before that.
Or at least that happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets function the way they have been, and if they react to Fed's money tightening as they have done before.
Such conclusions have reached the conclusion of the German bank Deutsche Bank's London market research strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in a wide range of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank shared the Long-Term Asset Return Study report on over 60 pages to its international major customers last week.
The strategies developed by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest rates or what will happen in the economy and in the market thereafter.
Instead, they present how the economy and the markets have previously behaved during and after Fed's interest rates, using the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics.
In addition to historical findings, they will examine which key parameters of economic and financial markets are now the same or the same model as in previous interest rates - and possibly the result of that.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now more well-balanced with the increase in interest rates than once before since the 1950s.
It may not even a year at the beginning of a recession, but not one year, nor one year, nor one year, nor one year, nor another.
The monetary policy of the Fed and its leaders, which decided on its current regime, have been in the middle of last summer and the beginnings of the year have suggested that the time is beginning to be ripe to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate period for more than nine years may already take this week.
This will be settled during the mid-week and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee meeting of the Board of Feds will meet on the occasion of its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised the so-called Fed Funds Guidance Rate in June 2006.
At that point, the relatively regular but at a time, relatively small percentage point of interest rate of 0,25 percentage points ended at a rate of 1,25 % of the interest rate of Fed increased from 1,25 % to 5,25 % of the interest rate.
In 2007, financial market relief began from the most risky housing financing difficulties in the United States, and one year later, the financial crisis became a global nightmare of the day of the judgment.
The largest recession was reached in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic shocks began more slowly than has typically been the case since previous Fed's interest rates.
Similarly, the trials were more severe and severe than once since the 1930s' recession.
Deutsche's strategies have been reflecting the rises and falls of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950 and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
From the 1950s they will be making clear on the interest rates and their economic and financial implications.
The onset of the recession has taken less than a year at the earliest of the first interest payments, mostly less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
The increase in the exchange rate on the financial market has ended in two years from the start of Fed's interest rates.
After the early 1950s, Fed has set up a cycle of about a dozen different dimensions.
Each time there has been some deviations from others, and the coefficient is relatively scarce in the review, so it is unlikely that there is any certainty about the impact of the following interest rates.
The strategies also remind me that this time many things are different.
Not better than that.
Interests too low too long too long too long too long
Even decades of research work may not be undisputed because of the crucial causes of the financial crisis.
But the three factors that led the crisis and the causes that have increased its power of destruction are likely to be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other major central banks of the world in the 21st century considered their steering rates too low for too long.
They placed traces of the technocouve system, and they raised the next one at the same time.
2) The volume of debt accumulated in various parts of the financial and real economy over the decades, and even too large already, increased by overvaluation of central banks from monetary policy to even greater.
Born in the economic history of the year before, the largest debt bubble in the history of the economy was born.
3) In particular, in most cases, the worst-case financial holding of the financial sector was the result of the major exchange rates of shares in real estate, bonds and commodities in most areas of the financial market until then.
Moreover, it is unlikely that there would be a very severe dispute that, in the case of increasingly complex debt gaps, the increased financial markets were extremely dangerous and unstable, when Fed and the other central banks last put up interest rates.
The valuation curves, which had been provided by the debt-backed financial structure, did not last as long as they had been after the interest payments had begun and the debt financing costs had turned up.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Largest bubble and more debt to you.
Deutsche's strategies don't think what's next, but they give the topic of nuclear technology by mentioning, for example, the following elements:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now held the momentum of their monetary policy even more lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis, they have now been even lower than even longer.
(2) Debt has not long been insane as it was ten years ago, but now the debt is at its worst literally cheaper than it is to say.
Thus, the financial and real economy debt stock has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt debt ratio has become more severe than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity provided by the banks has largely remained on the financial market and the key types of securities and assets have slowed down at most since the peak or never before the financial crisis.
Not only are the strategies of late feeling on financial market warning signs, but they also note that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the decades of the most difficult recession to the model ever since.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but in contrast, the pressure and risks of financial markets are equally higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed next starts to tighten up its financial resources.
Perhaps the picture of the future of the French bank Societe General's strategic Albert Edwards is not as strange as it may seem.
He has already trained international investors from the Bank for a good time to the following full versions of Fedi:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial bubbles will break, and soon it will be time for Fed to move forward in order to shut down financial flows with even larger QE-breaks.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are due to the HP Business Service Party, the company reports.
HP is divided into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., a company that focuses on business sales in November.
HP had the largest number of staff in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records the non-recurring costs of EUR 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000 to 30,000 employees.
The cost reductions will remain at 3,300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low cost countries with 60% of its employees in low cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has balanced its business already so that none of its clients will be responsible for more than 10% of its operating income.
In the second year, its three main customers brought 65 per cent of their operating income.

Yle: Minister Berner has acted in the Government of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
According to Yle, the company’s activities were related to so-called tax planning.
It is a question of a Luxembourg-Stri II LuxCo company, which was appointed member of the Board of Directors, Berner was appointed as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still officially a member of the Government.
Berner himself said that he had submitted a notice of resignation of membership this May of this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the chain of registration takes place in an agreed timetable, Berner says in Yle's interview.
In post post-inf post post-fusion required a membership of the merger, a membership required after the merger after the infusion.
The Luxembourg company manages the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company.
Kährs is a parking manufacturer who joined the Finnish parking manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner served as the Government of the Karlia-Upoflor in 2010-2013 and after the merger with the Government of Kährs, as well as the Luxemburg company.
According to Yle, the owners of Kährs go through a multi-port property structure in Luxembourg.
Berner says to Yle that he accepted a government membership at the Luxemburg Company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Government of Karlia-Upoflor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partner was requested for the company that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my task was to take care of the capital benefits of the Finnish family company.
It is important that we ensure that income from our capitals of Finnish companies is taxed in Finland and that it is safe to base in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capitali's ownership does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure established for tax havens is because the largest owner of Kährs’ capital fund Triton had already been prepared for acquisitions by a Luxemburg holding company.
Espoo opens the reception centre of the company managed by the company's reception centre in Espoo.
The first reception centre held by the company will be opened in Espoo in Otaniemi for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this evening.
The number of places may increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 persons.
The Finnish Immigration Service shall establish a reception centre at the property of the former Finnish Rescue College.
The operation is maintained by Luuna Oy, whose sector is particularly concerned with the production of health care and health care services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luuna Oy agreed among other things on the Centre's security arrangements.
The JRC will prepare an alternative occupational blackmail package to prepare an alternative work-life package.
The JRC is proposing to prepare an alternative package for the government's labour market blackmail.
The organisation also hopes that other employment centres should be included.
According to President Palola at the moment, the emphasis is on Friday's demonstration.
An alternative way to reduce labour prices will be restored afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out that the organisation’s administration meeting would take a break for journalists.
Palola estimates that, on the other hand, the Central Business Union (EC) is not ready for discussions.
The EESC's eco-economics have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's Competitiveness Package will cost the employer an estimated €30 million, which is €2 700 million on the other side of the package.
I don't know if a party is awfully eager to have a conversation if there is one ratio to 100.
Palla: The negotiations had been constructively constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to submit a communication of its own package to the Parliament and start the preparation of reforms.
The fire did not take a position on whether the timetable was realistic.
The discussion with the Government is in existence according to Palola, and it has been constructive about him all the time.
In particular, in the field of the STK, on Sundays, Palola says that there is a sick spot.
The organization requires the government to resort to compulsory legislation in which it would be involved in the implementation of part of the crises.
According to the PSC, Palola does not allow the option package to be prepared with the relevant SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose the labour-life blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the salary for the first sick days will be cut, the overtime will be halved, Sunday allowances will be reduced to 75% and holidays reduced.
The STC stresses that the central organisations have called on employees to express themselves, and that there has been no strike.
The plan Fjeder congratulates its thanks.
Mr Sture Fjäder, President-in-Office of the Plan, congratulates the JRC on its communication on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjeder, the JRC is now coming to the same lines with the Plan, since the Plan has long been developing an alternative model for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, as without SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare a presentation for surgery as an alternative.
Antti Palolan's STK told us earlier on Wednesday that he would prepare new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
The plan was announced on Wednesday that it has been preparing its own proposal for a long time to negotiate the five-percent competitive jump as an alternative for operations by the government of the country as an alternative to operations.
The plan has always been ready to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to look at the terms and conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to the Agenda lines, as the JRC has done on Wednesday before.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to prepare a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, Fjäder says.
The scheduled Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to take a decision on the possible content of the agreement.
"S the same boat, the common coal, the thaws" - plays Bingo In the evening when the Sipilä talks at night at night.
Green Left at the University of Tampere
Vivan bingokupoonki, the Green Left of the University of Tampere University, for the evening.
The Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the rebellion and wars of Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä is very exceptionally speaking about the state of Finland's economy on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for the corresponding Prime Minister's previous speech, it is necessary to go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the prime minister when he held the famous radio call, which meant the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and ministers then held a number of calls during the winter and the continuation of the war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho, instead of President Mauno Koivistö, gave a New Year's speech, but it was more of a ceremony.
In autumn 1976, President Urho Kekkonen quit on television the strike of train drivers.
Single phone, monarchist makeup
The speech by Sipil has raised all day criticism and guess what I'm going to have to do with it.
Mr Paavo Arhinmäki, President of the Left Union, said on Twitter that "The Sipilä could speak about the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed".
According to the Green Ville Niinist, "one phone has already been seen.
leadership involves dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the Erkki Judge of the SDP condemned the fact that "monarchist us: Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it".
Antti Rinne, president of the SDP, appealed to Sipilä's dialogue: "I have six months of election.
No single presence from Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is it you are afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was submitted directly by Mr Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, and by Jyri Häkäser, CEO of EK.
Yöle has been criticised for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered this and noted that it was part of the public service mission to promote the entire Finnish-wide publicity of the line Yle’s publication director, Ismo Silva Yle’s news.
It's like the time of the Tammelestime.
The speech has also raised the facets of beggars.
The dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the kids will be stowed and dressed as their best.
Mom's gonna put on the nicest bitch and Dad's gonna tie his neck to the tie.
At 9:00 a.m., it's slowing down to television than I used to remember at the time of Me Tammelois," writes bbigar Saku Timonen.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also asking why the Finnish Government sits in its tax havens for millions who hide their capitals from its tax havens, who make laws of mercy to other tax-maker friends, and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the State is out of the money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is the Green Left from Tampere University Viva.
It's been published on Facebook by the other bingon.
Do we hear about the same boat, the common coal, living in debt, and the team crew?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 21.05 it begins and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
A Ahtari in Guardian: The Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for a Russia's exclusion from Al-Assad proposal.
More than three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by which the Syrian President Bashar al-Asad was allowed to abandon his power, reports President Martti Ahtisari to Guardian.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan in which al-Assad would, for some time, have been swept away from the power in a elegant manner.
However, the Western countries did not take on the proposal because they thought that al-Assad would fall in any case a few weeks.
Ahisaari discussed the crisis in Syria in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed him in a bilateral discussion with three points: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and Al-Assad immediately had to be contacted and the withdrawal of Al-Assad had to be done with restraint.
I know, Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all things, but we will be able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I was doing there and he said to sit down in Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari will remember the interview with Guardian.
Diplomatics did not comment.
The Ahtisaari tells me that he communicated the message of Tshurkin to the United States, the United Kingdom and France, but nothing happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaari, there is no two words about it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Mr Ahtisaari's arguments, but said that Al-Assad's troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all the agreements he would have been in possession of.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle East Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, has expressed doubts about the Ahtisaari talks because, according to his experience, Russia was not prepared to discuss Al-Assad's fate at any time.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
In a few moments, Ahtisaer claims that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow council.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have answered that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
At the same time, he would have suspected in that case that it would have been Putin's passion to maintain power with some kind of supporter of al-Assad.
The refugee flow of our own efforts is our own fault.
During the negotiations in the Ahtsaari, approximately 7 500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
More than 11 million people have fled their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees to Europe is what we do.
I see no other choice but to take good care of these people.
Now we're paying the bill that we made for ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the paper.
An asylum asylum asylum seekers’ organisation centre with a trap to Tonnio
The organisation centre for asylum seekers designed by the government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The Centre would be set up in the centre of the city in an empty building of the Tornio Joint Assembly.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, Helsingin sanomat announced that the council would have already decided to present the school building to the Ministry for a space resolution.
According to Vice-President Saul Hööppinen, vice-president of the Tornio municipal council, that is not true.
When the entire council was not assembled and some of the team wanted to take a formal decision, we decided to invite the council to the meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he specified the matter to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 at the local meeting.
The organisation centre was opposed by 13 delegates.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision would be positive," says the "Best".
According to General Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday and quickly responded to the matter.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at one time would be able to cooperate.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so that would be in mind, Nousian says.
Sipilpil still still hopes for a job market option for blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) the half-life of the public holidays would only cover part of the government's efforts to calculate the labour price.
However, the government would be happy to accept an alternative package if the organisations of the labour market are successful in such an agreement.
Sipilä told the journalists in the Parliament that he had not been in contact with the organisations of the labour market.
Nor did he know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternative means of blackmailing working life reported by the government.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will, of course, be happy to receive it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, half-life would be a means, because it would be directed at almost all employees, unlike, for example, the surgery planned by the government on Sundays.
Organisations could agree between themselves on the operation of holiday allowances because they have been registered under collective agreements instead of law.
On Wednesday next week, the Government will report to the Parliament on labour-life crises as a communication from the Government.
According to the team, the suggestions of the organisations should be known before this.
This is not the final payout either.
The legislative work will then take off, i.e. the train is on the move and it will get harder and harder all the time.
This is a very good time.
It's not going to be long on such matters if there's a will, Sipilä made it up.
The list published by the government last week includes, among other things, the change in the statutory working hours for unpaid holidays without shortening the working hours of the year.
In addition, the salary for the first days of health is cut, the overtime are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75%, and holidays are reduced to 50%.
The reforms will be implemented as a compulsory legislation by trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of these actions, the civil society organisations organise a major demonstration on Friday, and several trade unions have also declared political laws.
The Law of the Tohma Lake's council approved the extension of the storage stock of the juice hall.
The mandate of the Tohmajärvi was unanimously approved but the extension of the stock stock of the Administration of the Nordic Koivu Oy, called the juice hall, was slightly extended by the Administration of the Nordic Koivu Oy.
The criticism was caused by the fact that the project was larger and more expensive than the originally mentioned project.
The busy schedule is too busy.
It was also a little wonder that the order was not known a year ago when the decision was taken on the previous extension was made.
At this stage, the extension of the stock at 400-450 sqm was approved in the investment programme, but the funding will be decided as part of the interim report.
On the new agenda we were talking about an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000, but at the meeting of the Technical Director Erkki Ikonen said that the price would be estimated at EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the local community.
The municipality has no risk, since the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Population (ps.) was justified.
Another place for the sole language of the herd even lies in Joensuu, where there is a place for the tongue of the herjala in the city of Joensuu.
The city’s government reduced its previous firm stand to bring cattle-language street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in view of the election of the tradition of cattle throughout the country.
Joensuu is not a capital city of cattle because it has no historical grounds and is not a natural part of the region's identity.
The language spoken in the River region has been more famous for the Eastern Savoval murders.
After a new decision, there will be no sign of nickname in the city centre.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, well prepared to use the language of the cattle, for example in the information tables and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude that the city recommends to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is a formal one-lingual municipality, it is also worth considering the use of the language of a cattle who live and change strongly in Northern Karelia as well.
The language of Karelia is still unique to the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the forest capital of Finland as a whole.
Both can well benefit from various marketing activities in the region.
The end of the train connections will cut the life force of the county.
Train connections surgery hit the county's vital vitality with a hard hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the business and competitiveness of the county.
And that seems to me whether you can live and work here at all, Karen Karjalainen, Mayor of Joensuu, wonders whether you can live and live here.
He also points out air carriers, which have also been on several occasions in the course of the report.
For the whole region, it is important that we do not have the opportunity to reduce government measures, as is the case now.
The impact of the cessations of these transport links, for example, on employment should be seen, for example, by Karjalainen.
The worsening of transport links creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the principal of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen, says.
He points out that bad connections also affect a faculty that is very mobile and travels a great deal because of research.
The recruitment manager Marko Junkkarinen says that marketing of the university towards Western Finland is already difficult as the transport links are weak in the cross-border direction.
At present, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
About 10-20% of them again are New Zealand, which is partly explained by the direct connection to the train.
Joensuu became one of my soars for Siu’s war.
The view of the Government of Joensuu on the Local Siu War project is apparently unanimous, but one of my lines is also one of them.
Pentti Central Hall (sd., p.e.) presented the entire project for abandonment at the Government's Monday meeting, but his performance became unprofitable.
The Board of Governors approved a draft resolution by Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the meeting of the municipal council, which will give final opinion on the project at the same time with all other municipalities.
One train train from Kotka Kotka to Kouvola will end next year next year.
Personal train services from Kotka to Kouvola will continue in the future, although less often than one train couple.
There will be changes to passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola next March.
One train partner will stay away, but another five days will get from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The reductions are due to state savings.
The purchase money for the next four years of rail transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys got out of the way.
The rescue facility let off the climb to the roof of a 12-year-old who didn't get my own way down from the roof.
The situation was born in Tornionä on the Keto Road at 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storeed wooden house, where there are no ladders that can be taken to the roof at all.
It did not stop a crew that decided to climb up the roof of the house through the mask of the radiomagists next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the other people were making noise and the passersby alarmed the rescue facility's position to assist the last person on the roof who was safely left behind on the surface by means of bets.
The turnover of FedEx varies from one year to another, with fewer prospects for the financial year 2016
FedEx announced its weak result in the last quarter. The transport sector has left its whole year's profit forecast as a result of the decline in demand for freight services and the increased cost of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the rest of his vacation.
The company's share decreased by approximately 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the actual trading opening on Wednesday.
The FedEx forecast is $10.40–10.90 for the financial year ending in May. In the forecast there is a fall of 20 cents from the previous forecast.
In fact, according to the factset investigation, the analysts predicted $10.84.
Despite an average price increase of 4.9 per cent, these increases will enter into force on 4 January. The additional payments for land transports of heavy or large sizes will enter into force in November.
The company is still expecting an increase from the previous year due to cost cuts, higher turnover and growth in the online trade.
Mr Smith, President-in-Office and CEO-General, noted that the company has been performing a very expected weaker economic situation, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
The seasonal worker pay plans were made up of days after the competitor UPS announced that he planned to pay approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95,000 persons.
In the quarter ended on 31 August, FedEx's operating profit was USD 692 million, which means an increase of six per cent.
The share-by- share result was $2.42. So the forecast of USD 2.44 for Zacks Investment Research was left behind.
Net sales increased by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to the six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has been experiencing a reduction in international first-class broadcasts, which is why the company's activities have been blocked in place by the company's Express Unit.
The strong growth in the network trade has confirmed the result of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but operating profit showed higher costs for large-scale shipments and insurances.
The unit was better produced thanks to higher basic charges, while the return on the freight business decreased due to higher labour costs.
About one hour before the actual trading opening, the stock exchange rate of FedEx had fallen by $3.55 or 2.5 per cent to $11.5 per cent.15.
On Tuesday, the stock ended up falling by 11 per cent from the average of the year and 17 per cent from the highest notation recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the Bank of Central Bank Fed will meet for the most expected meeting in the years, which will be held at a diameter of eight-metres from the Israeli tree table to decide whether it is time for the first time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
On the wall wall wall of the central bank’s decorative two-storey meeting room, the United States is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Governor of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, of the central bank, must place the State’s financial interests above all other interests.
The central bank has a double order from Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, the management of the central bank has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be missing from the point of view of the decision. Thursday, the central bank is required to indicate whether the U.S. economy is ready to begin the withdrawal of an unforeseeable irritant offered by short interest rates that remained close to zero at the end of 2008 at the end of the year.
While most of the data shows a steady increase in the economy, the recent decline in the financial markets can already be completed by careful officials of the central bank to scare up volatility by increasing the reference rate for federal taxes – even a quarter of a quarter.
Of course, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important in their practical monitoring", says Lindsey M. Piegza, the chief director of Stiel Nicolas & Co., and says.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to levy taxes, there is still sufficient uncertainty for the global market to give a reason to wait", Piegza continues.
The interested parties do not agree with what the Central Bank intends to do, which in itself causes tension.
About half of the economies in Bloomberg’s study were exhausted by the increase in interest rates this week.
However, on the financial markets, it is considered that the expected central bank and according to the key indicator is only a 30% increase.
If the central bank rises its steering rate, the stock exchange rate may be calculated unless the decision-makers have a soft blow by promising another raise.
Tuesday Dow Jones industrical average scored 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
"In the context of the recession there were expectations that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said Moody's Capital Marketss Research Group's chief director John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise for the central bank to raise interest at this stage," he said.
"If so, the central bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of the financial actors unshakeded."
On the other hand, the other experts noted that by raising interest rates, it would be possible to calm the financial markets and remove uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
A month ago, the central bank seemed to become more expensive to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be a first small step towards tightening the financing conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yelle has observed that throughout the spring and the beginning he expected to raise interest rates this year, despite the fact that economic progress is needed according to the Liberals.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate decreased by 5.1 per cent last month, at least for seven years at its lowest and close to the level that the central bank considers to be full employment.
Wage income seems to be becoming more and more expensive.
While inflation continued to fall below the central central bank’s annual 2 % targets, central bank decision-makers found that this was a key reason for having a sharp temporary effect on oil prices.
"The economy can be done with higher interest rates and it needs them, as long as they take into account the strict situation in the labour market," said Pantheon Macroeconomis' chief director, Ian Shepherdson.
However , the financial markets worldwide did not fade in the last month , when China devalues its currency .
Dow Jones industrial average peaked up to 16 percentage points from May record height, and investors feared that the economic downturn in China would also affect global growth.
The markets have improved this month, and Dow Jones has now fallen by almost 10% from the peak of May.
The decline in the market means to the governors of the central bank that the reflection of the rise in the steering interest rate will be further altered.
"The work of the Central Bank will be complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and what news has come about the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks", UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate's senior researcher and former central bank official Stephen D. Olier said.
Now he believes that the central bank will expect at least a month to be able to deal with the impact.
"There is great uncertainty as to what will be the impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the situation since the recent Chinese economic development", Oier said.
The improvement of the global economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful player in the world’s monetary economy.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, just a hint from President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce the scope of its operations brought about revolutions all over the world.
In addition to monitoring the developments in the world, the central bank is also required to contact other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall view of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of Keskusbank is more art than science", according to Zachary Karbel, Director of the Global Strategy for Envestnet Inc.
During this month, President Jeffrey Lacker of the Regional Central Bank of Richmond stated that the central bank had previously overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be connected to the underlying economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, who is entitled to vote by the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for a guidance rate to be raised, and he highlighted the example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis in the case led to the central bank's decision at three meetings to calculate the steering rate of 0.75 percentage points, although only limited identification of the consequences for the economic growth of the United States", Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank repealed the decision.
"The Central Bank should give monetary stability priority only in a major crisis, such as the economic collapse of 2008", said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The latest crash is not even approaching the situation at that time," he said.
"There is no reason to be afraid of the shock in the market", Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen added.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double mandate, and it does not mention monetary stability, until this changes, I do not think that I should go ahead."

The Rio Grande Children’s Association SPRS has developed a blinding way of teaching lactating women the importance of a proper diet. They offer pictures of babies breast-fed with photos of unhealthful foods.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, so the baby receives all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Because of additional energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kg each day.
Further changes to diet should be made in addition to increasing calorie levels, according to the new study.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of Medicine in Texas revealed that a pregnant woman’s healthy diet may affect baby genes and protect the baby from tumour development.
Unfortunately, abnormal diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
The biggest viewers in the Seven Sunris, although Nine is trying to get the lead on her Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson would like Canberraa to make a morning show for the post-elections of the leaders of the Liberal Party, which did not, however, greatly improve the Today viewer figures.
The morning programme for the Nine Channel was sent from the capital to Malcolm Turnbull, abandoned by Tony Abbott.
The morning program of the competing channel created by David Koch and Samantha Armyage was sent from London. Special weekly missions from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun are also sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It seems that the trip did not have any relevance to Australian television viewers, since Sunrise averaged 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, and the Today programme was 339 000 viewers.
The Toda viewer figures rose slightly from last Monday (317 000) to Tuesday (283 000), but remained from last Thursday's reading (343 000).
Today has been reaching out for a distance from Sunrelle in recent months.
In August, on average, there were 318 000 viewers on Sunday, 330 000 viewers.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September Sunrise has so far reached its average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314,000 viewers.
This whole morning's most interesting event.
The changes in winds will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are fine, please ask questions.

The remarkable news in Seven was the 800 Words series that included the former Packed to the Rafters Star Erik Thomson.
The Ujúzsdrama tells us about the late widow's father who decides to move on the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached a great number of 1 219 000 viewers.
The critics have doubted whether Thomson's hit show alone without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
According to yesterday's viewers, the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor preserved its strong position with 1 136 000 viewers. The series was brightly reflected by The Block (838 000) and the TBL Fairies series (726,000).
Seven The Chase Australia has imprisoned the viewers several times.
On average, 446 000 viewers followed the first half-hours of the new billing series by Andrew O'Keefen (17.00–17.130).
On the second half hour (17.30-18.00) the number of viewers rose to 623,000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seattle (613 000).
Monday afternoon, during the first half of The Chase Australia, on average, there were 520 000 viewers, and the second half gathered a huge sum of 70,000 viewers.
The number of viewers for Hot Set was 620 000.
The Chase Australia's second night viewer numbers showed the Nine Channel that Hot Seat's still passing at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar for me, who was unable to challenge McGuiren's series.
The case has been originally published under the title "Sunrise One, Today Focuss on Local News".
The final triangle thinks that Sam Wood really is the bachelor of dreams – but who is the man that chooses?
Did the secret reveal? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Markosk may have deliberately revealed the choice of the son of dreams.
The final choice of Sam Wood's dream boyfriend has been a highly protected secret.
The three remaining women do not have a word with who has received the last rose from the boyfriend.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before the three of us put one away, and the women were deliberately suggesting who would be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed until Thursday's final.
All three women were fascinated that Wood was a perfect man. Women praised man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him to be a suitable partner for themselves.
When women were asked who would be the best partner for Wood if the last rose would not hit their own place, their answers can give you a quote about who will take the male's heart to the heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markosk quickly named Mackay himself as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything has been easy between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood since the beginning.
"As I arrived at the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam agreed well together, and this feeling has survived throughout the program," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah's got legs on the ground, and he's having a really fun company", Markoski added.
"I've seen them together, and I have to admit that there is chemistry between them.
They seem to be a very creative couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks he and Sam Wood are a good couple.
Mackay told me that he found out last week on a hometown date that Wood could be the real one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized this wasn't just a party, and now I'm putting our relationship fully together," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood was supposed to choose, if a man did not choose him, she answered with a mystery:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like all the other girls as much, Snezana and Lana are equal."

Jarryd Hayena has a number of options for the launch of NFL-ura.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayy's amendment to the United States. Several others were also interested in the man after last year's impressive open training day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and the selection seems to have arrived.
Some trainers would have held Hayne's bench, as the man had in the row of the Australian rugby country team. Hayne offered the return situation to the flight stop team to take victory from Minnesota on Tuesday at 20–3 a.m.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave him a second chance to return the plane shot. Coach had Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in the dressbox after the game.
He did not rush the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, but encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly during the post-game press conference.
49ers' special editor, Cam Inman, reported that Hayne was encouraged also by the special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget about the failed arrest and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne hovers the capture, in the first quarter of the game played against the Vikings in Minnesota.
Hayne and his Australian fans had waited for another man from NFL debyyy.
Hayne left the field hundreds of times after the failure and later told the 2DayFM 104.1 channel of Hamish and Andy that he couldn't have imagined a worse start for the NFL career.
"This happens, and we have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error of his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when his entry in his own area opened up a place for Queensland.
The whole experience was still incredible for the 27-year-old youngster.
Hayne published a picture on Instagram in which he would post along with fans and Australia flags.
Elton John and President Vladimir Putin, President of Russia and Elton John Vladimir Putin, discuss gay rights.
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at the airport at Siberia.
Hodorkovski, the author of the challenge of President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced to a man-owned oil company Jukos was deported and his work in favour of democracy was limited.
Four dead police shot in rubber caves for protesters in Nepal with four dead police shootings in rubber bullets.
Four people died in South Nepal, the head of the administration told me on Wednesday, and the police shot a crowd with rubber bullets in a protest against the alleged new constitution of the country.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region, about three hundred kilometers from the capital of Katmandus.
According to Border Manager Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1 000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some of which threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and lit the air before the rubber bullets were shot.
According to him, twenty cops and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which can kill, but which are generally considered to be a less damaging alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
It was the latest summit in the weeks of continued protests in the southern plains of Nepal, where, according to the Madhes tribe, new provinces based on the new Constitution would weaken their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal where the Tharus tribe requires its own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have died in violent twins since 10 August,
Four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces, which is an important step towards a new constitution, but the topic is very sensitive in Nepal, where the government has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been worked since 2008, but the legislative speeded up the process since the shocking earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
The legislators have voted on the provisions of the Constitution's Articles of Association this week, and according to the authorities, the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.

Google plans to raise $ 11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign to raise $11 million to humanitarian aid organisations that help thousands of people who have escaped from war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead, the campaign was launched by Google's employee Rita Masoud, who was only seven years old when he fled Kabul with his family.
"We traveled on a dark train and a bus and we were starving, thirsty, cold and scared", Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
The family that has been hit by the crisis in Europe, in many similar situations, is in need of assistance.
Donations are addressed to non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children’s Association and the UN Refugee Organisation.
After the donations have been collected to google.com/refugeerelief through 5,5 million dollars, Google promises to donate an equivalent amount to a total of 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is now being hit by the Second World War, and the situation is particularly worsening of the four-year civil war in Syria, which has led to more than four million people running away from their homes this year.
The war will also have to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

In patients with mildly overweight diabetes mellitus may benefit from obesity surgery.
According to the new study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetic patients may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether patients with mildly overweight type 2 diabetic tissue after obesity surgery are longer than those who receive non-iroperative treatment.
"Accessing mortality data will take time," said Dr. Bonebroke expert Robin Blackstone, who was discussing the new research in JAMA Surgery.
A muscle surgery, i.e. bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach by different methods.
The bitter methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective forms of treatment in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have affected sick overweight individuals with a weight index (BMI) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the weight and length of the normal value between 18.5 and 24.9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can count your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers from the Thai hospital Min-Sheng have used the data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two methods of B meat surgery, gastric bypass surgery and hiccups, type 2 diabetes medications in mildly obese patients.
After weight loss, the average body weight index fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year of the year.
The weight index of those who received uninterrupted treatment was maintained in 29 hours.
The overall improvement in diabetes was 36% and partly 28% in the treatment-treated patients.
In the treatment-treated group, diabetes improved entirely by 1% and partly by just about 2%.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and poor LDL cholesterol were also better in the surgery group.
Researchers also monitored patients with haemoglobin levels of A1c, which describes the development of blood sugar levels.
According to the investigators, the recommended haemoglobin concentration of A1c is less than 7 per cent.
At the end of the surgery, the haemoglobin concentration decreased from 9 to 6 per cent on average.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at approximately 8%.
However, the study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsun concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study also compared the consequences of two different surgical procedures.
In the fifth year, the weight loss in the gastric bypass group was higher than in the hiccups (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the decrease in the weight index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as was the decrease in haemoglobin levels of A1c (3.1%) and 2.1 per cent). In the guidance surgery group, diabetes also improved by the majority (46.9 per cent and 16.7%).
However, according to the Swedish study of Blackstone, the Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, which has been working in Sweden, has not been able to show a lower mortality rate after five years.
In a Swedish study, the probability of mortality in the subjects who had undergone a gastric bypass was decreased by 29 per cent in comparison to the conventional treatment group over 15 years.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, Blackstone confirmed that persons with a weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important discovery of the study, as it indicates that the operation is safe in the lower weight index group, and it does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
According to Muststone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is between 27 and 30.
"We wait too long for people to start to take the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When a person's body has experienced genetic changes that expose to obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult to turn the situation around."
"All cannot come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leading figure of Tibet’s Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees’ countries of origin.
The Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis in his visit to the United Kingdom. Dalai Lama was speaking at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion Centre in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, humanity must be put before individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be welcomed, it was not sufficient in this situation.
"It is an impossible idea for everyone to come to Europe", Dalai Lama said in her speech.
Although Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in a crisis situation, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"A great deal is taking care of thousands of refugees, but at the same time there is a great deal of long-term solutions and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," Dalai Lama stressed.
"We must, at the end of the day, consider how we can reduce killing in these countries.
The use of force must be reduced.
The means never have solved problems", he added.
When speaking about violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the activities of George Bush in the context of the 11 September terrorist attacks and claimed that, when resorting to the resources to respond to the terrorist attack, the United States brought about a chain of uncontrollable events.
"After the attacks on 11 September, I expressed my regret to President Bush and told him that the solution was born through violence.
I know that his purpose was good, but he resorted to forces with unpredictable consequences," Dalai Lama said.
The hand-rerererere re four-folded children in four years in four years, four-years, four-years, four-years, four-years, four-years, four-years, four-years, four-years
According to Georgia’s poisoning centre, the United States of the United States, in all parts of the United States, are reporting that alcohol levels have been almost four-fold higher than 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia’s Poetry Centre of Toxicity, hand-losing events reported to children under 12 years of age increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are increasingly accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are being given priority", Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handmades for a purpose, part to impress their friends and part of social media, inspired by social media.
The YouTube video shows teenagers who drink disinfectant because of a cheap hum.
The tests are described in the blending disinfectant with an alcoholic mouth water to make the drink stronger than drink.
Smaller children can attract the smell of handmades.
"The child doesn't think the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of attractive handmade products is just diffused.
There are delicious handmade products of corn, grapes and orange that appeal to children."
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small amount for young children can cause alcohol poisoning.
"The alcoholic strength by hand", the medical director Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 channel in Kansas City of the University of Kansas Hospital.
"No one would leave any bourbon for children, but if they often leave their hands disinfecting products to children, they quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
The six-year-old Nhaijas Russell recently enjoyed four lorous mansica-taste handmades at school, and the girl was delivered to the first aid facility.
"The absolute blood alcohol content was 179, which is doubled in comparison with the adult hop limit," says a doctor who treated a girl from the Gwinnet Medical Center near Atlanta.
Oh, yeah, and she couldn't walk when she was brought in first-aided.
The doctors followed the girl in a separate day hospital over the night for brain damage because she had fallen and struck her head after drinking alcohol", Ritchey told me.
"The record was really scary," said Scott to CNN, the mother of Nhaijah, of Ortoria.
My daughter could have died.
Mr Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants, apart from the fact that your hand must be transferred to children beyond their reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two of the Italian women died after swallowing hands containing toxic substances that had not been reported.
The health authorities considered that the active substance in the product is not an ethyl alcohol in place of the fatal methane content, although the latter has been reported to be the active substance in the product leaflet.
According to the police report, three fourth-grade students in the north of New York State were planning to kill a "good" teacher in January by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is very allergic to handmades and denied it to be brought into the classroom.
The police considered that the plan that had been passed on was meaningless and called for the most training to be done with discipline.
The rumor: does not match in the Celtic row: does not match in the Celtic row: does not match in the Celt row.
Griffith shorts the Celtic team's disapprove, while Delila admits that the team's not all right, but he thinks it's gonna be okay.
Hearts buttons against SFA's versus SFA for Neilson's punishment, and Warburton warns that January players will be warned by January players so that the unity of the team will not suffer any suffering from the unity of the team.
Aberdeen neck in Celtic five points five points in Aberdeen's neck in Celtic.
The first half sentence of ADAM Rooney gave Aberdeen a little victory at the Pittodrie stadium from Hamilton. The victory increased Aberdeen on a five-point flight to Celtic.
The Griffiths rejects the speeches of unsatisfyence.
According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not under observation when preparing to meet the Dutch leader.
"I don't think we're under any pressure, and I think the players are waiting to meet.
Dutch people long for the old Scottish battle pairs – de Boer – de Boerer.
The former Rangers middle field player and Dutch national football player Ronald de Boer have found that the Dutch football fans' interest in Celtic has been over since no longer to be able to track Celtic and Rangers' double-stampings.
De Boer, the leader of Ajax's team leader, said: "The Netherlands no longer presents the highlight of the Celic games. Why?
Because the Rangers are no longer involved."
"This is not just about the Rangers' return.
We're talking about Old Firm here.
The Dutch are looking for two-stakes between the teams.
The Old Firm games have huge tensions, and they are also interested outside Scotland's borders."
I'm going to take good good control of the situation, Deila will reassure you.
RONY Deila admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but Norwegian credit assures me that there will be a change in the situation.
Malmölle's lost club fell out of the league of the Masters and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has five points lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we're gonna get up again," Deila said.
"We want our situation to improve as soon as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and it causes many people to be angry or hurt.
So are we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need support from Celtic's supporters, as it will significantly strengthen players' players.
The spirit of society is now really important."
Warburton cautioned in January’s playoffs.
Although only a few weeks ago, Mark Warburton suggested that he would be careful about the transfer language and say that he wants to jeopardise the unity of the team.
"January players' transfers are significantly different from summer transfers", said Brentford's ex-s coach.
"The team's summer-related players will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has been successful in our composition this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes unnecessary gambling purchases can cause more harm to the team than good."
Michu, who thinks about survival at Celtic's end of life.
Mr. Swansea's attacker, Michu, has been linked to Celtic in mobile phones. Michu, in turn, has been referring to retirement following the end of the Swans agreement.
Michu, a 29-year-old, has been an obnoxious ankle for years, and he was unable to get a transfer from Wales during the summer.
Hearts are ready for the SFA stand in Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team was finally lost in 3-2. The defender's red card was cancelled later. It is already the third Collum red card within eight months, which will be canceled.
However, he stays behind his words. "I didn't question honesty, and I didn't comment on the performance.
The Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastlea.
The Griffiths were persecuted when a man confessed to his readers to his disgusting songs about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in Edinburgh in the Roseburn region before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the mood was intense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee that I won't go back to Tynecastle except in Celtic lines."
Tanndice Executive Board believes that Dundee United's coaching board – Donnelly - Donnelly - Donnelly.

"Stefen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes welcomes the Hamilton victory with a dirty game.
Derek McInes admits that Aberdeen was desperately forced to press against Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive league victory. By victory Aberdeen caught five points in the neck of Celtic at the top of the chart, which is a thank-you for Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half.
"There is no cup or league winner team that would not have won such games", McInnes said.
Unemployment is unchanged in Scotland, it is growing in the British Islands.
ENTRY STAFF remained unchanged in Scotland in May to July. The number of unemployed is 164 000. In the whole of the United Kingdom, the number of unemployed grew at the same time to 10 000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, while it was 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.

The employment rate in Scotland decreased by 74.0% in the quarter; the average employment rate in the United Kingdom is 73.5 per cent.
Scottish Minister David Mundell commented on the recent figures: "The long-term government plan has established a basis for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to maintain itself as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has declined.
Why am I following the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, unless there is a legal basis for the withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is done, what I hope is that I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison spray.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received a invitation through the best friend of the man and despite my shock, I replied yes to the invitation.
As I approach the day, I'm terrified.
Then why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you the truth about the death penalty.
The vision would be unique.
Journalists will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and since applications are more than local places, participants will be selected at the Macaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers' places from 12 to five.
The following executions have been chosen moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I've created a man's personal relationship because we've been talking over the phone several times over the months, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present in both the witness and the supplier's capacity, so I must not take the notebook and pen with me to make notes.
All I have to do is try to put some details into my mind.
I was accused of being impeccable on Twitter.
"The idea is this:
When you tell the condemned story in a way that pleases him, you'll get close to him."
I gave the reporter my differing opinion.
The supplier's wife admitted that she could have formulated her words more carefully, but she still thinks I'm wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed on some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I'm writing, and even if he tries to order, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him that he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international supplier who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he will believe that publicity will promote a movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, editor of Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you want more information about this, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I'm not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that a man named Glossip has not committed murder.
I definitely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
A neutral description can be read on other suppliers' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from the Canning River after he was pulled off the Canning River after a police station.
In the Canning Vale region, the officer remained dry to lure a man up from the Canning River.
The Perchite man's escape attempt came down to a low, mudded water, a few feet away from the police got a grounded man back into a dry land.
On Tuesday, the Canning Valen police received a call from the unauthorised residence in Beckenham.
On arrival, the police found a suspect who was trying to punish the police by heading to the Canning River.
However, the man did not make much of it.
"The man standing in the water told me not to get out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia did not attract baptism, so he chose a safer tactics — a negotiation.
"A true escape attempt to make a person resort to interesting means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The Ben Cousins case is an outstanding example of football champion Ben Cousins.
In 2006 Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police strike and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man's attempt was doomed, but the tempaus urged the locals to plan Ben Cousinsbiathlon.
According to Peter Moody, the operators tried to spy on him, and he threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody is accusing the operators of Racing Victoria from the spy business last year, threatening to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been attacked personally by agents and by Racing Victoria's integrity department, and the rejection of Lady Tata's recent day treatment was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to work for competition sport. Moody has been in a difficult situation when a cobbot was found in Lidar's screen, and he couldn't explain what it was about.
Moody's been on his tongue for a year and a half for spying charges, and he didn't want the charges to seem like a bitter man's operation.
"I didn't intend to raise the point, but I've been thinking about this for a long time, but sometimes the frustration is going off with a single stroke," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"I must react and accept the consequences. I must now accept the space after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I sleep well nights.
I want the owner of the horses to believe that I can do my best.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't think I should go on as a horse coach anymore.
I would have to think about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in the Racing.com interview, where he told me about the integrity department of spy companies in his stable.
"Wonder years ago Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable with the purpose of spying on my actions. I'll tell him when he asked for his name", Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If so, they would want to provide proof, because I have not been caught by anything unauthorised.
Former Chairman of the RVL Robert Roulston, RVL's current president, David Moodie, and the current CEO of RVL, Bernard Saundry, were aware of the activities at the time and now.
Should I consider the situation as a personal driver?
Should the RRVL take action and maintain responsibility for the situation in the sector for non- coaching officers?
Am I a threat to the industry?
Am I really a bad thing for the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Perhaps I could still get a training license and push me away from my duties, and I have no doubt that, with my words, I will make many people think that way.
But I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and that's sad.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make their decision.
My family supports me, and I can get out."
A long-lasting investigation of Linder's cobolic values and the recent rejection situation made the coach frustrated in the end so that the man threatened to abandon his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable Master Black Caviar, and he described the day-to-day care policy to be ridiculous after the horse's feet had been set against the rules of the clay line.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"The person in my prison wrongly put clay on the horse's foot.
Caviar treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done last day, and that's what happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moody can expect a three-month non-competition ban on the treatment of clay against the rules that the organisers have started to deal with.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that rules are necessary, but here goes too far", Moody said.
Arrested by a prisoner escaped from the place of crash in Cobram.
The police have arrested a guy who met up with a biker this weekend who escaped from the crash site.
The biker was taken by a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he got a serious injury after he hit him at Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove the car escaped from the scene and didn't leave to help the injured biker.
A 50-year-old man from Natalia registered to Shepparton police on Monday.
A man is likely to be expected to be accused of non-stop and assistable duties in road accidents and other traffic infringements.
The 40-year-old biker from Cobra is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy points out a stretch on opponents’ button talk.
The Melbourne Storm coach, Craig Bellamy, considers the criticism of his team's assurance game to be the intended action of the NRL's two leagues.
According to Coach Trent Robinson of Sydney Roosters, the judges gave Storm's bends to the Melbourne hosts to win a scratch fight in Sydney on Friday night.
Coach Wayne Bennett of Brisbane Broncos covered a hard-on reference to Storm Broncos' winning kastinal at Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a model game and said that he did not care for any more about the paints in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his own team's puzzle and said that they were just focused on contact when they fought.
Bellamy added that his trust in his own team added that the two team coach criticises his team. Bellamy considers this to be evidence that the trainers worry about losing Storm.
"This thing always comes up. I remember Trent Robinson didn't say anything about the button when his team beat us 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense system or technology all year long.
Trent's been on the job for three years, which could have been a shock to him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It is amusing that the same thing always emerges at the same time from the same year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about the interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne is talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team on Saturday to a game of our Friday game and considered their game interesting", Bellamy said.
"Vonna 2010 St Georgea got a lot of criticism about his boring game. Wayne noted that the review did not give him a moment of attention.
Now he's got a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast central beneficiary.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player-arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play his way, and not all teams have central players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I'm more confident about this when other coachs are about facing my team so worried that they're going into something like this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that more paintings were made in Storm and Roosters than in the meeting of Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the outcome? 16-12?
The outcome of our game was 20–18. We had more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are playouts and low-value football interesting?
I like the goals that make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend because the team will be invited to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronuella Shark's next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will come for sale on Tuesday morning morning.
A Serbian Serbian official free $ 200,000 against bails in a drug case against a drug case.
A possible man waiting for a life sentence of 40 kilos of cocaine possession in Queensland has been released against $ 200 000 guarantees.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month by a police officer to find a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo from the Solay ship, which had become through Vanuatu via South America and arrived in the port of Coomera in August.
The police were monitoring the meeting of Maksimovi and his co-counsel in a boating morning for a time and, two days later, surprised by the Coomera Roadhouse coffee coffee. 40 kilos of drugs were found in the Tokyo Echo car in the parking lot.
Although Maximovich is expected to have a life-long possession of drugs for commercial purposes, a man’s lawyer claims that there is no evidence that his client was trying to get the entire shipment over him, but he could have been in a coffee shop for innocent purposes.
According to Peter Flanagan of the Supreme Court, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has contacts with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently", the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
The mother and stepmother of Maximovic paid together 200 000 guarantees against which the man was released.
"As we read both persons' voluntary testimony, it is clear that $20,000 is a real financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
"But that alone is not enough to prevent a man from running away", the judge warned me.
Maximovic was released on condition that he gives up both Australia and Serbia's passports, will report to the police every day and stay at home from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophilia used a 11-year-old girl's phone to get control of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took her phone while she was sleeping and registered to an online communications service where she made another user send out inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, when she woke up, she found that the phone was missing and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When explaining the content of her phone, the girl found some clever messages and told her mother about it immediately.
Five of these photos were notified to the police. After looking into the computers found at the address, the police found disturbing Internet searches using search keys to search for inappropriate child images.
Hogg told the police that he was trying to mislead the pedophiles on the Internet and that he was pretending to be a police officer with a view to scaring pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilith Robertson said at the local court in Dundee Sheriff's Court: "I claimed to be dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had made the search on a computer, but claimed that he had acted so as to present the police and thus be able to scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and who Hogg had asked for more photos.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He said he'd had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanting to look at pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "After she found out the messages on the phone, the girl yelled at her mother and cried."
The girl saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She told the defendant that she used the computer and Playstation to discuss herself with girls who looked significantly younger than she did.
Hogg Dounden Ward Road, a 23-year-old, acknowledged the accusations of possession of inappropriate child images on 14 June last year. Hogg breached his immunity against guarantees on 25 January this year and refused access to justice for hearing on 24 March this year.
The defense attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be placed in the register of sex offenders, as it can be considered that there were no significant sexual characteristics of the offence.
The Sheriff, Alistair Carmichael, suspended the decision on October because of the background report on social work.
Hogg was granted exemption from guarantees in this case, but he was held in a detention facility under other grounds, claiming other grounds.
Hogg was added to the register of sex offenders before the day on which the judgment was declared.
Mr Zimbabwen Robert Mugabe keeps the wrong speech in Parliament.
Africa's oldest Head of State, Mugabe, fell in the stairs leading to the spokesperson's height earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of what happened quickly spread in social media.
Parliament’s opening arguments were also called upon by the opposition legislators’ arguments that they had received anonymous threats of killing in which they were warned to refer Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, the representatives of the people were defame and interrupted by a mid-term discussion by a speech by the President on the situation of the State of the President in Parliament, which was given the same speech on Tuesday.
The MDC Party (Movement for Democratic Change) bishop Innocent Gonese stated that seven opposition politicians received texts calling them not to interfere with Mugabe's speeches.
"We have sent a message of unknown number, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The communication warns recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer in the circle of immunity.
According to the party that led by Morgan Tsvangira, the party is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings activities in the business of business services.
HP is divided into two stock companies later this year and separates computer and printing business from growing business and service activities.
According to the HP, the company records the lump sum costs of USD 2.7 billion of the arrangements from the fourth quarter onwards.
"Reorganizations will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", told HP CEO Meg Whitman, who will lead the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more focused company of HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of transactions that help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said. Whitman.

Arsenal Captain Mikkel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb meets Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it is only September. If everything goes well into the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not go back to the field by December.
The best scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the following four English national team games. Man's history hour of his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest problem with the latest problem is that Wilshere decided to make the last period strongly after the shifting period and seemed to have returned its former steel during the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"He didn't get well.
It's not about a serious injury.
It was just an accident.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or past injuries."
Medically, this may be the case, but as Mr Wenger also said, additional injuries can come when a player tries to return to the field between the period.
This also includes detectable adverse conformity of the Regulation.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of trouble since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's lines in only 65 of a total of 157 out of the leagues over the last five years.
The wider image of Arsenal is that from 2007 to 2008, six out of eight periods have been the second largest among the teams who have lost money because of injuries.
Wenger accepts the possibility of a witch show, but Arsenal believes that the injury statistics improved during the last period continue to develop in a better direction.
"Some of the return after the injury could be linked to a vulnerable period of time when the body needs to be strengthened and the competition powers applied for" Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be fine with this.
I hope he gets his body balanced, and I believe in it, and by doing so his career goes on as he deserves."
Arsenal will start his Master's league on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare small changes in composition.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be the beginners.
Wenger may also set up an initial meeting for Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest to people who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the Group F as a successor, Maximir Zagreb has the most scary stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unbeatable 41 game time team.
The stadium was shaken Tuesday night when the earth was shaking at 3,2 Richter scales.
The attack was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from his last year's lesson after he bends to Monaco, and he continued to be motivated by far-reaching hope of creating a team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"The title hasn't been hit yet.
On the other hand, we were very close to 2006 and on the other hand, I am also realistic with experience.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: Comemedia series, which taught us the truths about friendship between men and men.
A similar description is reflected in the absence in other categories. It is remarkable, especially given that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and that the suicide statistics of young men are at least 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in Britain. The suicide rate is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) is infected with the problem by the declaration of 2015 for men. The campaign is designed to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed. According to the study, healing opportunities for those suffering from depression are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of unresectable people was also halved if there were people around them who had no mental health problems.
But all this is based on friendship relations.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication mode is often more important than content. A rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need for a strong, fun and successful doubled, although isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image, and social status of material success are all taking note of internal values and our need for personal growth and friendship. Internal values are more profoundly reflected in our mental health.
A video game millionaire recently noted that money really can't buy happiness.
The fineness of the French was that the series turned the focus to the top of the line.
No one in a series of characters was defined by a profession but by personality.
The series was humorously presented as Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football on their TV chairs. We also saw Ross often miss Rachel. It was clear that men were able to identify themselves with this, even though they are not arresting themselves fully.
One volunteer explained to me this: "In listening to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us often cannot talk to their friends.
The traditional idea of men being a part of the mission is strong, and the husband is easily considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frends are one of the series that sets out mechanisms for long-term survival.
In the series, the small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone, I can provide help from outside at a moment of despair, but long-term support is provided from close relatives and families."
In honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the series's sets have been restored to life, so if you are taking part this weekend, you should take your friends to a coffee for the Central Perki.
Or do something better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks alone.
You never know how important a friendship relationship it can be.
Comedy Central will send the entire French series – all 236 episodes – in honor of the #FridsFest in honor of the French Festival.
D Maria's hit helped the PSG hit Malmo's Malmo's Malmö.
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after the painting against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria managed to paint the Masters' league debut and helped PSG hit the Swedish team on Tuesday in Malmo.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when Paris Saint-Germain began his work at the Masters' league by hitting Malmö Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. He confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in hand. P.G. However, he dragged several goals before they could finally add to the lead: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A-blocks are also Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish champion. PSG did not only reach a destination in the drop-off games, but also wants to improve its positions for the fourth quarter of the three remaining matches.
Although SPPG caught the score, the match was not perfect for the team played by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost the goal of painting, and the man got switched when he met his former home club, where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy for the masters to win at home or in guests, so the 2-0 victory and the good manners provide a good basis, even though we still have a cheating season for us", Blanc said.
"This is good news.
We were thirsty for victory and we were able to do it, but I'm afraid we couldn't do it together or two more paintings."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he was injured, and this weekend, the team had to be satisfied with 2-2 matches against Bordeaux in the Ligue 1 series. Di Maria left Ibrahimovic in her shadow in four minutes.
In the last month, the Argentinaese player who moved from Manchester United to PSG's lines was appointed as the director of the PSG, who will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved himself worthy of being the name when he thanked the ball's Marco Verratt's pitch by Malmö's defense and then shot the exact target in the back of Johan Wiland's back.
However, those who expected PSG to be crushed were disappointed.
Malmö fell in Celtic's playoffs, marched to the field nine international players since the start. The defense of five men and the team playing with the two attacker's tactics were difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot just ran over Kevin Trapp's goal back end in the 34th minute of the game. The team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, the PSG fell into unnecessary feeding and poor finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five goals only in the first half of the second half of the day, and Ibrahimovic's fire from the second half of the second half gave Cavani the goal.
Ibrahimovic, however, showed his nails in the feed game. Di Maria, of Ibrahimovic's bait, shot a screw shot by Wiland at 52 minutes.
The second goal was created by the Count because of Cavan. A man who played through his hand shot a full-time shooting when Ibrahimovic fed him his left wingman for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's letter ended with another goal, and only from the nearest distance to David Luisi's shot had to be read and the Ezequiel Lavezz goal was completely abandoned on the road.
Malmö created a Åge Hareide admitted that PSG was his own class. "We played the game of the previous Masters' league last December.
Since then, we have only played in Sweden's league, where the level is not the same.
Carniards are not enough.
An application for couples.
This was a game of their own."
