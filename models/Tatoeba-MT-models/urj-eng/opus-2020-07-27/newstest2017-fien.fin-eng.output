A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping center's brawl this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he does not know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, "His affairs were finally doing well."
The body found from the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscolia Frank Galicia, the San Francisco death examiner's office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was defined as a spirit crime and that the investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's channel to KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a sister-in-law in Boston, had received his dream job in Sanfrancisco's Sanfrancisco's Sans & Daughts restaurant as a headquarters chef six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they are "hidden and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he's going to miss him very much," said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Mr. Louis Galicia said that Frank had been sleeping in the hostel, but that recently "it was going well at last".
"He found the apartment and he dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling solidarity with the family was to make us food, make dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who was driving with the power.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an insolent diamond that made every day brighter," he said.
Everyone with information on this matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police tip line at 415-575-444.
Medical practitioners stop: Requirements for new work campaign measures.
Doctors' representatives have asked their trade union to adopt new working combat measures in their dispute concerning the new agreement.
The Committee of the Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the whole Council to support new work-related measures from the beginning of September.
JDC says that ministers have failed to deal with concerns about the agreement.
The doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement they had agreed with BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
On Thursday night through Twitter, in his letter to the members of the JDC President, Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "severally silent" on issues which he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC Government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement completely and to call for formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
As a response to the Government's silence, the JDC Government has today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain authorisation for a progressive and expanding work struggle programme beginning early in September.
It has been observed that doctors have participated in the sixth strike this year, including the first complete job stop in the history of the NHS health care system.
The director of BMA's doctors, doctor Johann Malawa, resigned after the vote had been rejected to the agreement, with the conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told BMA members at meetings before the vote of 55,000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be accepted.
After voting, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be directed to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: External Association?
Ele, who ended the crisis.
The Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to hand each other over and declare the battle of eight months of words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague Peter's palace in a golden hall, I was clearly impressed with the desire for more reconciliation in Ankara.
Yes, the event was closed.
But Putin's smile looked a little cloudy, and he didn't barely get too upset about the heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyyip Erdogan kept talking about his "loved friend" Putin five times according to a report.
I went crazy in the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but to even better.
The next day the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal represented opposites.
But the vileys of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin attacked Ankar because he stabbed Moscow on his back.
It was even worse when it came from an alleged friend.
The rebuilding of real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the median of the government's reigned led to an amazing, profound attack on Ankara.
All of a sudden, it seemed that the Turkishs were responsible for everything.
The most serious charges for senior officials were the fact that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade from the Syrian territories ruled by Isisi.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia won some kind of victory.
The benefits of an arrangement for an outrage are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost excluded from power in the failed coup of last month.
He has also been clearly shaken by continuous terrorist attacks in Turkey.
In addition, there is a economic motive.
Russia's economic packages have been heavy, in particular the ban on order flights, which are usually carried by several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast every year.
The figure has fallen by nearly 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for a late season to go to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
"Chairmen there, tomatoes back here", as the Vedemosti newspaper report formulated.
However, the visit also had political added value to Moscow.
We want to be angry with Western countries about what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
In addition, as a long-term long-lasting distance is increased from the previous EU accession negotiations, Putin is a very keen one to take advantage of the coolness and to undermine Turkey's ties with the Western countries.
The Russian leader must have received opening points from Ankara where he was appointed after the revolution company to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a clear explanation for Moscow, with its own deep-rooted fear of power change.
So this meeting at the French maritime customs conference enabled a "intermediate association" presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation to me: two countries that experience the failure of the Western countries to reject them and abuse them, combining their strengths.
However, these two have great differences despite the public reconciliation process.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently agreed itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides of Russia and Turkey.
It may be a shock that after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided to answer the question of their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostilities, and given the possibility of a complete disaster when a member of NATO Turkey shoots down a Russian combat aircraft, it is certainly better that two leaders are back in speaking elections.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears out of Scotland's non-Sococtlan customers from third customers from other non- Scotland customers.
According to the bank’s CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from third-party customers in Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's international objectives.
Since the bank nearly collapsed eight years ago and it had to be saved, it has abandoned these objectives.
The bank's strategies have been using the 'RBS' label to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sports, from Six Nations to Wimbledon Master Andy Murhay, Wimbledon, Six Nations.
But it is now considered right to let the national brands come first.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be restarted from the platform.
In England and Wales, all RBS references with the exception of headquarters and stock exchanges shall be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwana was interviewed during a round of customers and staff at Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand becomes our investor brand and the employer of our employees, because we are now becoming a lot more of a brand bank.
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global goals, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue the Six Nations sponsorship and has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move in the direction of the brand bank, because basically (we have been asking questions) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers", the CEO said.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offered these brands.
But with the work that we've done focused on the needs of our clients, not ours, I believe you will see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins at Newmarket with Predilection and wins 3000 wins.
The dettor showers champagne after he has a total of 3000 profits after a double win.
Turtle Sergeant Frankie Dettor confirmed his 3,000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday Friday.
He won his second victory on his home track during his race at John Gosden by coaching the Predilection.
A 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that achieves this milestone in the racetrack.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
A three-time champion of Dettor, who won earlier at Ghayyaar, said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20 000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
The dettor wonders himself for cheering himself up after winning Predilection.
Two contestants have reached this milestone in the obstacle competitions - champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record of more than 4300 winnings in his infringement career.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 winning.
Frankie is one of the best rivals of the present age, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical uncle distinguishes him from other weighing rooms.
She's a great ambassador to the races, her zeal and her charis have been pulling fans over the species for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would ride 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a joke for weekend and big races.
Speaking seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is a living person who is a good thing for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettor celebrated a visit from a milestone to a trade mark by a flying landing from a fairy tale.
Flying planes for flight landings, Frankie Dettor has been the face of the British race race for two decades.
This has been a mountain track.
A lot of profits in large races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered from a competitive ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he was having a hard time coming back six months after the ban on competition, but he showed a significant character character character in the case of suspects and when he returned in the best condition of his return.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettor has previously said that he would like to continue competing at least until 50 years old.
Russian Putin to designate the Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov, Sergei Ivanov.
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin has suddenly resigned Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted interior for many years.
The 63-year-old is now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport field.
The Kremlin opinion said that Putin 's 'ordered Ivanov to move away from the functions of the President of Russia', but no reason was given.
As of 2012, Ivanov Deputy Director General Anton Vato has been appointed his successor.
Mario, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital city in 2012, graduated from a respected Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and operated at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the president's protocol and board staff, says on the Kreml website (the boat).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the draft laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave a place and recommended that Vato be appointed to his place.
Do you smile convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest allies to Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, served as a USSR security service in the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a public television meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff withdrew from his own request.
But despite smiling on the cameras, only a few are convinced here - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So is this just the latter of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
However, the formal argument that the man, once promoted as a potential presidential candidate, suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy, has been taken into consideration with great doubt.
In his comments on the Krem's website to Putin, Ivanov said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex task, perhaps even to say a job, a task.
Well, now I've been head of staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
He formerly served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the State Security Service KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service in FSB, who replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his Vice-President.
The King rose into power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Once it was thought that Ivanov could become President of Russia after the second period of Putin, because the third term of Putin would have been against the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Only three and a half years later, Mr Putin became Prime Minister before his return to president.
The Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson received a shoe after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the exhibition site of the series in Los Angeles.
The producers of the series, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios announced that they had been separated in a joint opinion.
Mr. Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, filed an apology on Thursday before his resignation was notified.
There were creative differences and a dispute at the scene.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the statement by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, the details of how Gibson's character is removed from the team of FBI agents are expected to be later.
The 54-year-old who had been targeting Dharma & Greg's status schedule has been involved in the series since its first season of 2005.
"I love the Crimial Minds series, and I've given it everything for the last 12 years," Gibson said in the opinion on Friday, published on Friday.
I had hoped I'd been involved all the way to the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our incredible working group, and above all the best fans that can be found in the series.
The beginning of the 12th production period of the series has been planned for September 28th.
The mystery fish of mystery fish ended in the garden in Banff, Banff.
The Banff man has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bai believes that 75 fish could be windsurfings left behind by a water pit.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material in Periscope from the appearance of the film, hoping that someone might be able to explain the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fifeen.
The 1,35 mrd.’s pumping project is expected to be ready by May 2017 by May 2017 by May 2017 by the end of May 2017 by May 2017.
Engineers have connected Queensferry to the northbound along the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four parentheses that are now preparing for each three pillars of the bridge.
The size of the bridge Fifesta is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 exercise ropes.
The 1,35 billion-dollar project is expected to be completed by May 2017 at the latest.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is an historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's crossing site.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, where over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel have been used exclusively for the construction of this bridge section."
Despite the huge size and weight of the bridge, closing the seal between the ground bridge and the bridge is a demanding operation in which the extreme precise dimensions must be agreed between them.
Overall, nearly 79% of the bridge is in place and I'm lying about the last part of your deck of concrete today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to rise in place on the bridge.
Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the top of construction engineering.
When the final share of the road was installed and connected to the extension of the northern pole road, we had to close the remaining part of the road from the north, i.e. from the inland point of view.
This was done by pulling the north side of the highway from a land of 700 millimetres to the south.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding measure.
It's huge, because it's 22 metres long from the ground, weighs about 6000 tonnes and has to be pulled around 3% of the slope angle.
It is necessary because the tolerances that allowed the team to work were small, only a few millimetres in each direction.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy when they're alive"
Three men are "happy alive" after they fell from their fishing boat outside of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue ship station made an alarm at 13.20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event develop in the Moelfre Bay Bay Bay Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim to secure their boat while moving on to their own.
"We saw a boat going around closer to the men and we imagined the worst," said Vince Jones, the Rover of Moelfre's rescue boat.
"For the good part, the wind had blown it away from them by the time we got on the move," he added.
A local fishing boat saved two men, and a third 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging from the boys without a lifeboat.
The men were taken to the Coast Guard and brought back to the rescue ship station.
Jones said, "These three men in the water are happy when they are alive and completely unharmed.
There was a stopover on the boat's engine, but it was somehow disengaged from the time of the person who fell on the boat.
Somebody take care of these guys today.
Poopion Go is a respectable hunting for health and happiness.
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children are not going out to play anymore, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time looking at the screens.
Pokeon Go makes people stand up on the couch and participate in one of the activities.
The display time was originally limited to television, then to video games, and now recently to smartphones.
So it is great to see that technology and external air activity do not exclude each other.
I am referring, of course, to a fascination called Pomémon Go. The application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (the latter were created by drawing sets, playing cards and other future products).
Like many events in pop culture, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the publication of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
Since then, the game publication in other countries was delayed because of a huge popularity of overloaded servers.
In the days that Pokémon Gol had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell explained, players use their smartphones to search for Pomémons that are traced using GPS, and that can be "lighted" after being found (with the help of the phone's boxing) or "a call".
The generation that played the game as younger has joined the wild and jumped up with the couch to search.
In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in the daily steps of the "intermediate person".
The Apple Watch app, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the publication of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes per day jumped from 45% to 53% of users following the Cardigram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of training.
Many public health campaigns' call for "to watch 30", "get up the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most of the public health warnings are boring and caring for people who seem to be unhappy.
However, the importance of sport cannot be reduced.
At regular intervals, there is a lower risk of cancer or depression.
Activity helps weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The fineness of Pokeon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
In this way, three pillars of health are covered: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get to hunt for new friends.
As usual, aggravating joymakers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Even though there were applications such as Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new charm will disappear and the use will be expanded in due time.
However, as a result of the success of pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the activeness of the real world, helping many hunters to be more active, better condition and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's gymnastics multiplay.
Pressure pressure.
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
Energizing jump.
It's a whispering boom.
I can't believe it.
It's perfect everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast reached a multi-game championship on Thursday, leaving a gap between himself and the rest of the world on the Olympic Lights.
His total score, 62.198, was clearly better than a silver medalist and "Falal Five" teammate, Aly Raisman and Russian pronsist Aliya Mustafina.
In the US Simone Biles balance party, the multi-ethnic competition of women in the finals of individuals in the summer Olympics in Brazil on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Brazil on Thursday, 2016.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has repeatedly won the championship of the multi-game and, overall, the fifth American champion. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps for all time, for the best.
He broke out in tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey towards this moment ended.
This achievement will bring another generation of best athletes, such as Michael Phelps, into the same category with those who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has been ruling his species for the last three years, winning 15 World Championships, including 10 gold, programs whose ambition and accuracy mix has been so amazing that 1984's Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best to see."
The last test was expected in Brazil, a competition which was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between the burden of his and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning family home to Texas Spring without a massive gold medal would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman, having won gold and silver medals (in this order) at the final of the multi-stakeholder competition for women in the summer Olympics in Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday, August 2016.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he was a peak at the departure party of the National Team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future when he went on a long way to the top, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - the one that includes his trademark's volt missile - has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also fit the street along the Olympic arena of Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a burden, was discovered by Coach Aimee Boorman's mother when the girl was on her study trip to the gym where Boorman trained her, has become a power factor.
He hasn't lost a lot since summer 2013, and this profit line will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although the Blackfin was in a small chair after two tours, it was just a illusion.
Balance and permanence, where Biles is the ruling world champion, were waiting.
He rose to the top at points 15.433 and exceeded them by getting 15.933 perman.
Raisman saw him well when they were waiting for the final points - nothing more than a formality - and tears rose to the eyes of Biles glitter red, white and blue, when the dream of which he once wrote his copybook came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of a rip from four years ago, when he was divided in third place, but lost the probe to Mustafin in his upgrade.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, called the "great mother" by Americans, was clearly in command.
He sent airlocks to the public after his permeation, in a feeling of return, which sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as the party is concerned, this wide-ranging twelfth of 19 years of age from this week will have a completely new meaning:
Police Police: Three victims in the serial murders were shot when they were listening to music in the car when they were listening to music in the car.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the most deadly attack of the first serial killer in the last decade, were sitting in the car talking and listening to music when they were shot, and that's what was told in the police release on Thursday's release.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elisas' daughter Maleah were shot on June 12 by car to a car parked on a car.
The communication states that the shooter, who was standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, fired his hand up to eight times and then fled on another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death does not appear to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the purses or another adult victim to $2,900.
Officer of the Phoenix Police Officer, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said that shooting led researchers to examine whether it was related to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks over four months, made in two mainly Latin American cities.
"This is what happens in the residential area in front of the home", Howard said earlier this month to CBS's subsidiary KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used several means of transport, such as the brown Nissania in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s, as well as white Cadillacia or Lincoln.
The investigators have not agreed to reveal evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and are the same killer.
Ellis, 33, went to a hospital where he died later because of his injuries.
Lier, 31, as well as Eles's daughter, Maleah, died at the scene of the event.
The witness told the police that they were often sitting in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that took place only half an hour before the triple death, which was targeted at an empty open van, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
The researchers found the shell shell shells, the bullet in the seat, and the bullet in the engine compartment.
A six-year-old mother with microcephaly: "Til makes it easier"
Edmund Picciuu, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his age mates, Edmund is small-headed. This is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciu, did not know when she was pregnant.
"When he came home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do this.
I didn't commit to this.
What's not true, of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never ever learn how to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it," Picciuu explained.
Edmund walks with his walk-in.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly reaching some pistalic poles.
He walks with help and rides on a bicycle.
He also loves to play games with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth will show you how with Edmund's inventions, with his five fives, you'd like to sing to me.
"We teach him sign language", Picciuuu told CBS News.
But it's not the usual sign language he says that Edmund has come up with some of his own lines.
Microcephaly may be due to a number of different reasons: genetics, such as Edmund, or post-natal viral infections such as mumps or Zika virus.
The symptoms and forecast can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those who have been infected with Zika.
It's easy to remember the emotional load of a uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
He still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked you about the forecast in a while, because I don't expect anyone to actually give me that kind of thing.
But Picciou has desirable advice for mothers whose babies have birth defects due to Zika.
It'll make things easier.
You can believe it'll make things easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The weights and floods caused rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi, Mississippi, Louisiana, Mississippi, Mississippi and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi, Mississippi and floods.
The kings and the widespread floods in Louisiana made the governor declare an emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
National Weather Service reports that many rivers in South Louisiana, as well as southern Mississippi, flooded over their nostrils and caused massive flooding due to extreme fines for rainfalls.
Louisian governor John Bel Edwards said that the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance is already coming into the needy districts.
Mike Steele, the representative of the governor's security and emergency emergency office, said that they would receive requests for lifting water from vehicles, boats and sandheads.
Steele said that the region of Tangipaho alone asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood is valid until Saturday in most parts of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in its opinion that the area would be expected to have more rains of three cents more in the area.
In the south of Cuba the flooding was valid on Friday, when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge, as well as the Amite River that flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana and is predicted to set a flood flash show during the weekend.
weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood several houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of the Ascension county along the river, when flooding rivers slow down to Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool, was at the highest level of all time on Friday morning at 9:00 p.m.
Rescuers were still picking people up from flood water in the Amiten and Wilkinson districts at lunch in Mississip.
Leroy Hansford, along with his wife and stepmother, were on Friday near Gloster among the saved ones.
62-year-old Hansford says that normally, at a distance of over 400 feet from his house, Beaver Creek's water rose rapidly during the night.
He says the other half, the one living near him warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just went on rising," Hansford said.
It extends to the belt.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she hasn't seen a stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both him and his family have injuries on all of them, and that he is the only one who is able to swim.
Hansford said that the rescue workers saved three large, military-style trucks and took them to Gloster's firehouse where the saved nights stayed on Friday night.
Krautmann says that floods are "combined rapidly" in the context of the continuation of the criminal attacks, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been fully satisfied with the crisis since the middle of the week.
The flooding of the beaches and streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of Tangipah County from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five schools, the authorities said.
CBS’s subsidiary WWL reported that in Tangipahoa, a member of the municipal council said that 200 homes were left under the flood.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, but both of them are now under the flood.
The county president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had remained islanded by the rising water.
Amiten and Hammond cities have opened up shelters for those who have been evacuated.
"They'll be allowed to return to their homes when the water comes down," he said.
In the town of Hammond, the city of Tangipaha, a few streets were closed because of the rising water, and the residents were allowed to pick up sand bags to try and keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The most recent flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrative authority.
This is going to be a similar case.
Rupert Lacy, the emergency director of Harrison County in Mississippi, said that even rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday the houses were told that flooded, but so far no flood cases have been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, the leader of the Opera Value Foods movement at which Keith Townson has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and the rain still continues."
"The current bullets" had been six years old Maha Mahaha Brown will find out about Philadelphia's shooting shooting.
Police are telling us that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shooting in the city this week.
Parents told CBS Philadelphia his name is Maháj Brown.
Parents say that Brown had several gunshot wounds, including his throat, leg, arm and stomach, but he was unconscious when he was transferred to a hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets", the boy's grandmother Delores Mellenez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
At the hospital, the son’s condition has been recorded as critical, and several surgerys have been performed on him.
The family will tell the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was about to start his first class in local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot at the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One 29-year-old men were reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were stable according to CBS Philadelphia.
A child was found shot on the front seat of a car together with a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting status.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the shooter.
Detectives tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was been a cross between several shooters.
The attack attack-type shells, which are derived from various attack weapons, filled the site of the event.
It seems that this was definitely a continuous battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were active in the fight", “P.D. of Philadelphia, Anthony Ginald, policeman Anthony Gindi, told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance camera tapes.
Another six-year-old, girl, was hit by a fake bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Lauie?
Thus, I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colored girls.
The composition of this team, supplemented by Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, will make everyone proud.
This team looks like, eventually, America.
It has also established the participation of women of dark and Latin American origin at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the most successful women in the world has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is great.
In the last Olympics Gabby Douglas surprised me as an Olympic winner, and America was cheering up.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, where they present unexpected but mastered gymnastics programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman who has successively won the individual cult in the women's multiple fight.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We can see the top of the species, but the situation does not look like this in gymnastics around the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went the same way as Aly and Madison reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (last five) because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a expensive type, and gymnasts practice mainly in private gymnasts, maintained by parents who pay for training, facilities, travels, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (trainers and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnasts are located in wealthy suburban suburbs that can support the species.
At these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is a expensive and long-term commitment to gymnastics families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Hayey, coach of Laurie Herndez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We should bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities in which the numerous young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Lauren are living.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics for more than 15 000 urban youths (mainly black and Latin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September we extend to Detroit (a hometown) to provide high-level gymnastics for young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
Competitors develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as the greed, discipline and determination of mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health, for school and work.
This encouragement from the team makes thousands of young girls begin gymnastics, and it's great.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're living an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympic team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young women.
Doctor doctors are organising new sheets after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal for a proposal from Jeremy Hunt.
Ministers had hoped to close the dispute by agreeing to the improved agreement with the British Medical Association's staff, but 58% of 37 000 doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the agreement, saying that NHS was "insensible soil", and that even minor delays were detrimental to staff and patients.
The first doctors will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Last night, Dr. Ellen McCourt, president of the Committee of Doctors for BMA, said in the opinion: "The medical practitioners still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it stimulates the existing labour market crisis, and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
While the first group of doctors are being transferred to the new agreement for only eight weeks, progress has to be made and the time is running out.
BMA’s efforts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have faced the government’s refusal to participate and, occasionally, to have a profound silence.
Despite this promise from Jeremy Hunt last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of doctors.
If he does not, medical practitioners will be prepared to continue working with him.
At the end of April, the latest strike meant almost 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 waiting hours for nurses and consultants to be recruited to act as doctors in the strike guard.
Ministers had hoped that they would end the dispute by agreeing with the improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 doctors under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Executive Director of NHS Expployers, called on doctors to stop them from going to strike.
Mortimer said: "There is very little or nothing going on with labour, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and they cause care, anxiety and disturbances to patients, carekeepers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have been discussing with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, having responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Gurdy Role) and phenomena (Whistlebling).
The employers were hopeful that the continued positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further training for those who return from Sabbath leave, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, education leave and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how seriously employers, the Health Education Agency and the Ministry of Health are in respect of agreements with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds of a daily dose medication may reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of heart attacks patients benefit from two pounds of a daily liver medicine after the authorities recommended that it be given to people longer.
The anticoagulant medicine, ticagrelor, drops the risk of renewable seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is given for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or second seizures.
NHS administrator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NHS administrator NICE has advised people that it should be given to them for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140 000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of these get another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are due to a fat accumulated on the wall of the artery, which forms a ghost.
If it breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the heart of a blood circulation causing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can pass through the blood and break the brain of the blood circulation, causing stroke.
People who have already had one seizure have an increased risk of getting another.
AstraZeneca, a company manufactured by the Islamic company, which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the clotting less likely.
In the latest NICE draft guidance, it is recommended that people be given 90 mg tiagrelor 90 mg for 12 months, followed by 60 mg aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of treatments that prevent effective progress, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack later receive another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often disastrous."
The fear of retention may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
Evidence shows that ticagrelor with aspirin is effective in calculating the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
As we provisionally recommend tiagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the available treatment options for a number of thousands of people who might benefit from it.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of tiagrelor, especially as regards the risk of bleeding, are limited over a period of more than three years, the draft guidance is not recommended for longer than during this period of treatment.
The culture of political correctness allows the colonic flower flower flower flower flowering in Muslim Muslim areas.
The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the report of the Board of Directors.
The culture of political correctness has led to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, to be revealed in the shocking government report today.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles set up police, election guards and municipal councils for ignoring the evidence of the electoral culture because of the "ro-ten and religion-related hypersensitivity".
The former Secretary of the Community, the current Emperor of Anti-Corruption, said that the fear of voters on religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set up a chain of guard for the protection of the voters who have escaped from voting positions.
He recommends that voters present their identity card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even suggests that the voter's finger be put in an endless ink so that no one can vote twice.
The public should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for more access to the documents and decisions of the delegation, which have been taken by informal committees or working groups, to the press.
"This would not only protect you from the horticulture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the horticulture," he said.
The Government ordered the report following the vote campaign in the East London Tower Hamlets.
Last year the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of a number of charges for corruption and illegal actions.
The court stated that Rahman’s “very distorted” Muslim community had religious feelings and that it had silenced its critics against racism and Islam.
Rahman says "has run his electoral campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
Even 300 votes were reasonable or the result of a person voting on one another.
Sir Eric said that the evidence on the hippo was found all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern at the election post at the vote in which members of the high-ranking Muslim community were said to have pushed people to vote on the candidates they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the clearance of the voting system, including the identification of identity with the identity certificate.
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities' communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the parents' will, especially in those communities with Pakistani or Bangladesh backgrounds.
"It was a matter of concern that... the institutions of the state had ignored such behaviour because of the hypersensitivity of the 'politically correct' race and religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, which included the prohibition that political activists should be allowed to handle the voting tickets received by mail in order to put an end to the 'coupling' of votes.
The report, which Theresa May looks at, also calls for more stringent amendments to be made to those registered in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider the options for the identification of voters before the vote.
Use the finger of the person who votes for the lost ink so that no one can vote twice.
To ensure that they are entitled to vote, perform systematic nationality checks.
Set the three-year limit for requests for an automatic post-mail vote.
To prevent political activists from dealing with the votes and envelopes received via mail where the voices are sent.
Let the police set security chains around the polling stations.
To change the law so that it is easier to blame people for their fear of the People Act in 1983.
Make photography illegal in polling stations.
Require that only English is used in the polling stations (except in Wales).
Confirm the training to ensure that the staff maintains the rule that the voter should go to the tap alone.
Sir Eric with the Great London Police Forces, saying that it is "maclysing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets incident.
"The election court will remain as a result of a number of corruption and illegal actions for Lutfur Rahman and his officials," he said.
He was found guilty on several grounds without doubt, according to a criminal record.
He also criticises the inefficient 'publish square' checks at the polling agencies of the municipal councils.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the creator of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of electoral crops and the prohibition of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy for Kate's bike driver's double resolution and other famous pictures of the celebrities at Rio's Olympic Olympics.
This week, fans in Rio's 2016 Olympics have gone mixed up with a French biker from Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be a double-acting creature of the Duke of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only sportsman fighting gold this summer, who can praise his own famous double-loan - at least according to social media.
So, in honor of Rio's competitions and all the famous faces on our screen at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who seem to be clearly Hollywood's celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: The hunter and wolf: American men's most flexible team member Brady Ellison, left left, is compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's double living on the bike, many people online have been quick to point out how one of the certain archers could be the star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Member Brady Ellison of the U.S. Men's Key Team has caused a storm on Twitter since he surfaced his images, where he seems to be afraid of the same thing as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of social media acceleration, the archer admitted that he's heard from Leo since he was a child.
"I don't see a big probability, except maybe about the beard," Brady told Huffington Post about Huffington.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: a shocking impression of the United Kingdom's short-hyper from Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast, Alya Mustafina's greatest, visible eyes have been said to be a Cuban-American singer, Gloria Estefan, a double creature of Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgheia has been compared for many years with Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
Larger exchange of eyes: This user thinks Nathan is an Inception actor "sporting version".
A second long-term comparison has been between Master Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of which have the same strong corners and lips.
Yulia Efimova, a silver medalist from Russia, has more than the same actress Annalynne McCord, but also the brown and light hair, while the American team, Nathan Adrian, according to fans, says, "Joseph Gordon Levitt's sports version".
Hard women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, divide the same face shape and eyes.
It is not only: one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similar similarities.
Presentation of Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a number of similarities between a couple.
A Twitter user has recently expressed his happiness on the site that "other on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the United States football star and Dexter actor really have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with the smile of Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal winner Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful smile is to tie the Bring It On star Gabrielle Union smile.
CBC's Olympicist is an apology after an apology from a Chinese swimmer "devil like a pig".
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan instead of the 4x200 meters of free flight from women to women on Wednesday, CBC's direct Olympic mission was raged by viewers.
The Canadian television company CBC must have apologized after one of its complainants said during the race that during the 14-year-old Chinese ladies' 14-year-old woman's sister, "it was like a bad smell" and "devil like a pig".
Monitor Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the message terminal for women's 4x200-meter free flight.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporting team to bring "color", said, "That little 14-year-old from China, baby,"
Too eager, lost as a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you."
Chinese Limber Ai Yanhan, 14, swimming at the time of the second part of the message 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ruck, which allowed Canada to catch up with China.
The viewers around Canada react quickly online after shocking from the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane twiittanis: "Did CBC's reporter just say that China's 14-year-old swimmer "dead like a pig"?
The idiot didn't realize he was still in direct transmission."
China Ai Yanhan was described as "A young 14-year-old from China, baby" in the female freeway 4 x 200 m message terminal.
Review Byron MacDonald against Twitter was tough and fast, many people challenging him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and you make us all sound like a racist.
Soon thereafter, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC broadcast, asked for a direct apology to MacDonaldi's comment, saying: "We would like to say that a comment on the insight was sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, we regret that this happened."
The CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times for people who had twitched in response to the comment.
Scott Russell, a member of the panel, had to apologize for MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and attached an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The Tv company also quickly apologized and published its opinion.
We deeply regret the fact that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Last night, we quickly took action and asked our viewers and our followers in social media directly.
Therefore, it is clear that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
However, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry to say what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for his direct transmission and tried to define his remark by saying that he did not mean to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after a woman's message," he said at the CBC Olympic show.
"I took the swimmer off, not on him as a person."
"It's not necessary to say that I didn't mean it disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was stunned by a woman, who was arrogantly matching underwear in the middle of trade.
The customers didn't know where to look when she was taking off the middle of Primark's move to try underwear.
It didn't improve the fact that after assessing what she looked like in her pants, she peeled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally agreed to four underpants in a store located at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkeston.
Primark's business at Bouverie Place shopping center at Folkestone, where the woman made up her underwear and then put them back in the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children who were at the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after experimenting with underwear, a mysterious woman “dressed again and walked away from the store without buying anything”.
He said, "The people didn't believe their eyes."
The woman stood in the middle of the store floor, took pair of underpants, took off her own tights and underwear, and put on her suitable feet.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place for reconciliation, he just stood there in shame."
"They were all staring at him, while he took off his underwear and obviously didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for the three pairs before finally decided not to like anything he saw, dress up again and walk out.
"He didn't seem to care about who watched or thought about the person who would end up buying the underwear he made."
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident in Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone will take the underwear that someone else has tried, but who has not been cleaned."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I realized that the staff apparently tried to remove clothes from the sale after she left, which is good."
"It would be bad to go home with new underwear and find out that another woman's dressed them on top and took them off, and they haven't been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at the Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All those products have been removed from sales."
In this way, you can defend yourself from armed attacks using Krav Maga using the use of Krav Maga.
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the headmaster of the Krav Magad Federation, Rhon Mizrach, New York City, to find out how to deal with the gun-tanning kidnappers in close range.
Sent to you, either for you or for guarantee, this video shows how you can pay the attacker the same size.
According to Mizrach, if you are approached back, the first thing you have to do is turn around so you can see your attacker and "get the fireline".
Then you take a gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the attacker's face with your loose elbow.
By hitting the knee on the neck, and when the attacker goes on to the pain of a spark, turn the gun out of his hand, hit him with a gun at the front of his face, and step forward with a gun pointing towards him.
If the armed person approaches from the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the line of fire, tap the weapon and turn it around so that the criminal cannot trigger it.
At the same time, put the weight on the weapon and strike the attacker in the chest, then turn the gun against his grip, back and point him with a gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video about how Mizrachi does this exactly.
But remember, if you're not the headmaster of Krav Mag's, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright is licking Europe's dirtiest places for travelling to Europe.
The British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of the busiest and most nightly places in Europe.
A runner and travel writer from Suffolk, Ian Wright, 51, licking the euro note, covering the Piccadilly Crusus, the train's bathroom sweeping license and Russian public telephone to prove the strength of their immune system.
Before every target was licked, he used a camera to show himself and us the situation he was getting into.
However, the experiment of which was made by a film called after an internal force, produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a thousands of people's run-in drop-off button may seem totally hostile, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about the confirmation of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
I'm glad nothing that he licked left him no other than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became a well-known tester for his gut's endurance while traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
In fact, this public role of railway stations for the toilet seat laundering license did test his immune system.
In the movie he made, he said, "I've been rather anxious about my health since I was a child, and I've put all kinds of things in my mouth from the soil, the worms and the bad water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
In his screen there were over 4,000 units of reading on the camera.
For the sake of comparison, the reading of the arms of the opponents should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to lick when the results of the camera showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the opposite hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's movie, following internal force, together with a Finnish dairyer, Valo. The film shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet."
There's nothing better than that.
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's been a night here.
Following internal force marks were produced together with the Finnish Meiger, Valion, Valion.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefillus, which contains lactic bacteria as well as vitamins C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
Niko Väurenmaa, director of the selection of snacks, juice and new categories, said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something fascinating to look at, which at the same time would explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, about the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary shows that we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I also believe that document shows that we have a great sense of humor.
The documentary director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say this, though: if Ian had heard some of the things I asked him to do, as the nighttime Russian show in the film would have been, I would have lost my respect for him."
Obviously, some of the things I said were easier for Ian, while the part was rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows stored."
In a survey carried out by Valo in 2015, 84 per cent of respondents were specifically associated with the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58 per cent said that they at least used products that added lactic bacteria between themselves.
The night family destroyed the rental house in Cornwall's Saltah, before the check-out.
The household family caused the damage of 50 000 pounds to their tenants after they were evicted because of the terroristisation of neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwallin Saltah since they had been selected for numerous times.
After they had been removed from the property by means of force, shocking housing company staff said the property was in poor condition.
The walls had been made with exhausting holes, the floors had been torn off, the waste was spread to the floor and the walls had been broken with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the host of Cornwall Houston, said that she was afraid that the property could not be fixed.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for citizens, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There are a lot of issues to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is in bad shape, and their name is bad."
There were three boys living in real estate, and police said that the family's intimidation had to include street fights in baseball countries, intimidating nearby residents, drug abuse, drug sales, and intimidating, arguing and cursing.
In June, a 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was the lease contract, received a decision on the indirect behavior of the economy.
There were some old waste found in the rooms of the house under the sink.
The real estate from which we've been dealing with drugs before, the floor boards had been torn up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing evicted the powerful means of building a woman and this partner this week after having given them an extended period of 11 weeks, a voluntary change of time.
The simplified neighbours thanked their decision, saying that their lives had become one hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen the police here so many times.
"This morning, we didn't get any sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet in here, we're not used to it.
I love it now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of the Cornwall Houston neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property often often often often called the property.
Riskie and old toys have been thrown down on a busy wall of the apartment building.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own responsibility and the conduct of his family, for this decision is always the last procedure considered by Cornwall Houston.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions must have terrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and the Cornwall police and the courageous members of the community who provided us with information.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to the neighbours and send a message that anti-social use will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys were all living in a real estate in different times, but they were all in twenty.
After the wedding, one bedroom floor left a dirty pillow on the floor of the floor.

Apparently, Tanya and her partners live homeless after they've been left in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the house rooms on the walls had shrouded graffiti.
The police say they're trying to get rid of the residents who're gonna cut off the rules for their lease agreement.
The police at Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall said that the decision was a clear warning to the other tenants who would continue to respect the rules.
"This is a message for those who think that their conduct has no consequences, and for those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social use. The police will continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Travelers in Portugal were terrified when a military jet jet flew off the shore’s shores to reach low.
Solar tourists in Portugal Aveiro, Portugal, experienced a shock in their lives.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane of the Portuguese Air Forces' P-3C Orion would be wiped very low by a very low low plane.
Air Air forces said that it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At the moment, terrified tourists began to panic when a low-flight jet was wiped over a beach full of water.
The dramatic recording shows how a military plane came to a close contact with the sun-lights on a sandline in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The horsemen stood up when they understood to be concerned about the noises of the jet, although they did not begin to see what was behind the clouds coming towards them.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova, close to Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous vacationers who published videos of dramatic pastime in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed twice really low, and together it looked like it was going down."
Nuno Aror added, "I was surfing, and I really felt like the machine was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveairo were terrified when the plane came out of darkness and flew down incredibly low.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify fishing boats near the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably due to the poor visibility of smoke caused by smoke from lower nearby land-grounds, but the air forces assured us that no safety was at risk.
Land fires have been destroyed this summer by parts of the mainland Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Forces today said that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions that had affected low visibility, the smoke caused by the groundtops, as well as the thick fog, caused by the smoke caused by the groundtops, and the thick fog, which was responsible for the damage caused by the pilot.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.

A certain number of criminals prior to - criminal investigation helps to resolve criminal offences and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Each of the 11 police offices in Finland has been the RTA unit for criminal intelligence and analysis since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is outwardly invisible.
At the Hämee Police Department, the unit consists of four police officers in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
It is drawn by the solution placed by a sergeant.
He's a firing officer in Lieutenant Lade.
In addition, the strength of the unit belongs to a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in civilian costumes.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and need, considers Deputy Police Officer Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides other police with various explanations.
In a wedding, it has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
The reform of the latest working practices, the reform of the latest latest working practices, reform reform of the latest latest working practices, reform reform the most recent working practices reform reform.
The establishment of units of analysis is the reform of the latest police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make the police go more and less often than when they get the alarm.
By means of information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities will be targeted at where the most necessary is the most.
With the reform of the police, a crime intelligence centre was established, under three national units, and each police department has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre in the connection with the Central Criminal Policy in Vantaa is a national leader of the operation.
The PTR units work according to their name from the police, Customs and Border Guard Department.
RTA services, for their part, work in distribution areas according to the police authorities and are responsible for providing information to both local police forces and national units.
Knowledge extends beyond the territory of a territory beyond the territory of a territory.
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the role of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police area.
Knowledge also extends beyond the boundaries of the own institution, as it does crime.
The RTA staff have better ICT skills for the basic police.
The unit will seek, by means of registers, an alert function database and findings, to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, product criminal offences or similar crimes.
This is called a series of cases, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the method of action, the factor is made up of a certain kind of picture.
The order may be made either by way of action or by person depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes from their mistakes.
RTA employees do not travel through the city's necks, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals as their own are not reported, as it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus trying to prevent the police's anti-crime companies.
The police will publicly inform you if this is an indication of the threat they pose.
For example, this was the initial period of news, the means of marking empty dwellings used in housing accidents.
The authors put the apartment in the outer door with a stick, a pin or a tape panel, where they tried to see if the residents were really on their way.
The ex-ante investigation material shall be made public to at least the interested parties.

This case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Commissioner Tero Sepp about Häme Police, Inspector Tuo Tuomo Lepola about the Eastern Finland Police Department, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police Department.
The police will collect and analyse information on how to plan practical action.
On the background of a decrease in labour and funding levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation will gather information from outside the boundaries of the own institution and Finland.
A person-related schoolgirl killed in Syria, Syria, Syria, a father-related school girl from London killed in London, Syria.
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Is, says rumors that they have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasmina Akujee said that a girl's family heard this death in Syria Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that the girl was believed to have died in the Russian air strike of Raqqan, which is the base of the organization's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just when she was planning to escape from the land of war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of this case is that it can act as a tombstone and as a will to others that there are real risks involved when you go into the war area - that it could get people to give up on such a decision," Akuje said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she had married an Isis warrior in Syria, and that she had only been a widow after a few months.
Reid says Clinton's will keep Garland's Supreme Court under the Supreme Court of Garland if he is elected.
The Democratic President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that the President-in-Office of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland's Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate Republicans have blocked the confirmation of Garland since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate majority, says that the next President will choose the person who has been given the highest justice in place of Mr Anton's Scalal.
Reid said in his phone conference on Thursday that he would predict "a million-scale certainty" for Clinton to choose Garland.
The representative of Reid later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would call Garland, and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "react the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the Supreme Court of the United States Court of Justice of the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans, which are prevented by the name of Garland, are the "widowers" and "possibles" of the Republican president, Donald Trump, the President of the Republic.
He said Trump wasn't fit for office.
Treats says that a naked calendar is "for women as well as men".
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemer to publish the calendar of Pirrell's inspiration for the year 2017.
But instead of being naked, they're going to find their next top generation in 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his newspaper containing plenty of naked pictures differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is also for them.
"We must begin again to introduce a timeless and classic nakedness where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired with the images of these naked women," Shaw said in the press release, where the calendar was announced.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures via the network or in personal open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Location: Who really buys discs?
Single, middle-aged men love peckers.
Before you try to fill in a comment with the alarmed offenses whose author is not the First-one-one-aged Men, you will find that this argument is based on real information.
According to YouGov, the new coming of the albums is not because more and more people born this millennium are excited about the newness of physical objects, but about the loss of middle age.
Apparently, those who have recently bought a vinyl plate are most likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, it is most likely that the 18-24 age group will buy albums.
Also, it is not just about collecting hobbys, but it includes emotional significance: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But is YourGov's results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me in the middle of a busy street in Soho, I'd be wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be very careful before I stopped by, form a cup of my hands and say something of authority, like, "Let's look into it more closely."
Let's take a look at it.
At the same time, when Soho's charm power and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and stores, and office stores are now filling up buildings where there were formerly independent movements - there are still many magnificent specialized stores.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops, trying to assess their age and their sentimental pattern.
In Glasgow, Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (in Hungarian: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckles Records (in Hungarian: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends her afternoon in London for a meeting, and spins shops to spend a few hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"And I am," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, which appear above the picture (even sent a sample by email, did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge amount of records and singles is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy albums that he could not afford when originally published, and he can buy back those who he sold when he was young and broke.
"A large part of the material I bought is late in the '60s and early 70s, records that were published when there were 11 or 12, albums that I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that the sellers of discs are more likely to be introverters who enjoy their own company and add: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my evil."
Wez, a 25-year-old who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of his clients are suitable for YouGov's profile.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that albums have returned to fashion and who have become needed to buy their old albums back.
Based on what I've been discussing, people have been rid of their collections in general in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell cd to buy their albums back," he says.
This may explain an increase in the number of certain ages of vinyl glycerides.
But what about the alleged emotion of the discs?
A trade such as Phonican takes a few seconds to realize that the shops offer comfort to similar types of the Community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured especially from the nearby payment system.
Some vinyl fans may be ashamed of the digital world and choose to trust the stability of familiar discs; objects that raise memories of the happy days of teenage age.
"I think sometimes it may be about filling in the hole or some kind of comfort that the possession of objects creates," says Wez.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill out your thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" the other worker suddenly said from the record board.
A April opinion poll carried out by ICM revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a disc player that they never use, whereas 7% do not have a disc player to buy.
This point is likely to appear to be a serious concern when I look at the board of the bob nova collections.
This wake-up view is something that Jonny, 42, also working in the Sounds of the Universe, has noticed.
"Who came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a disc player, but I want to buy a Radiohead disc so we can put it on a shelf" he says.
It is not a large part, but it is definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a disc player."
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late-age people who are just getting excited about it.
At the Foppi, which today has almost a full layer reserved for pussies, I have a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventeen swings, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the climate is less relaxed than the previous movements mentioned - the sounding of the freshest scapegoat and sex-oriented pop of Wild Beast, and improvisation jazz - it is great to see a variety of different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to show true that it is standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has walked around Fopp for a few minutes looking at different records available for sale.
He's making book purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so it's not really a choice.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through something else, but the beauty of the vinyl is..." he's in love with him.
"I don't know how to explain... "that's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to make it look like I'm looking at the fairs, I saw a group of teenage girls gathering for a moment around the Polaroid cameras before Dad and daughter were thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left, there is a stairs with a wall covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern music and classics, essential plates of any average collection.
No one sees them - perhaps because they're just decorative, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It's all about "artevinyls".
But given that even the small attention given to these objects can mean more money for the industry and send some customers to Soho's cancers for more, there is not much complaint about this.
There will be no surprise that the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one who uses the most of the luxury, such as quails.
However, although my findings suggest that youGov's results are true at least in Soho's stores, they do not exclude the large number of lovers of female collectors and vinyls that exist in the real world, in stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in an office.
They really do not spend their Thursday mornings decorating their stores around Berwick Street and avoiding a creepy, 30-year-old C.I.T.A., looking at this when he suffocated over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-age men.
The Holker is the most remote living animal living in a living vertebral animal - a video report on a video.
Scientists say that the Holkers have a longer life span than any other planet's backbone.

The French court rejects the application for the removal of trade from the refugee camp in Jungle from the refugee camp in Jungle.
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities to release dozens of temporary shops and restaurants from Jungle camp in which thousands of refugees live.
During the hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to dispose of all 72 temporary trades in which people sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks within the camp, offer a haircut or sell tea with 50 cents (40 pens), or sell simple food by a few euro in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Agency justified that the places had to be landed because they represent a non-paymentd combined economy and because they are a fire and clean-up risk.
The humanitarian groups have told the Court that shops and restaurants are vital in saying that the free meals provided by the state support organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They claimed that temporary stores and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals for those who needed them.
In Liille, the Court of Justice stated that there was no legal basis for evicting 72 temporary-traded people, but said that Calais' prefect concerns "was totally understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role to play than feeding only "living people living under extremely uncertain conditions" people.
He said that the facilities offered peaceful meetings for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the break-out was Camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activities are non-profit-making, offering 200 meals daily, English and French hours, and emergency counsel for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition to protect children's coffee shop.
The letter to Guardian said that closing the coffee shop would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only eight years old.
On Friday, two charity organisations, Helpfuges and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that the number of people in Junglen camp has risen to 9,000 people - to peak - since the number of arrivals rose sharply during summer.
In Finland, food prices fall clearly faster in prices than in the EU on average.
In Finland, food is getting very cheap for consumers' joy and harm for producers.
In Finland, food prices have decreased by nearly 5 per cent in three years, while on average in EU countries its price decreased by 0.9 per cent.
At the same time, food in Germany and Sweden has become one-percent higher than food.
In the last three years, food prices have decreased most in Finland in the EU countries with the same wage levels as in Finland.
Compared to the UK alone, food prices have decreased faster than in Finland.
This information is reflected in the publication by Statistics Finland’s Development Manager, Ilkka Lehtinen, who was published in the Tie & Trendt blog.
The site compared real prices, i.e. prices relative to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices went near the price level in 1994.
The situation had to be alarmed.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came from EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The current price is the price of Russian food import bans, which have rejected food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have decreased.
"The policy has helped the Finnish consumer at a short time", says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition between industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
Large trade chains S-group and Kesko both have decreased their prices.
The consumer price competition has been shown to be the most visible promotional campaign.
However, Finland is still not the standard of affordable food, even though the price of food has decreased greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a level of pay similar to that of Finland.
According to the newspaper, VAT is significantly affected by the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the comparable countries had the same percentage of VAT, Finland would sell food at the same level as third countries.
The paper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only German and Dutch people would sell cheaper food than Finns would.
"If we want to get to the prices of food in the old EU countries, VAT must be halved on average in the EU and continue the price competition", Lehtinen writes.
It notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School is no longer the old age of school.
If you return to school, you may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools has been developed, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic period in all primary schools.
It is a guide that all schools in Finland operate.
Schools will decide on the details themselves, but the plan will indicate the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, a book of beauty is given up, and schools start to practice encoding.
Sweden's education will begin by the end of the sixth grade, and social education will start reading by four.
However, the major change concerns the role of pupils.
It used to be thought that a teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from one another.
This way, people are trying to make school more interesting.
The most long-life verteb who had the most long-old vert for the rest of the world was found, the ice icefs can live up to 400 years.
It is known as Greenlandese (Somniosus microcephalus) to reach sexual maturity at the age of 150.
It may then live another 250 years, report a new survey.
The figures make the species the most long-lived vertebrae in the world.
In the county, it is passed over only by the Icelandic wolf whose oldest known individual has been scheduled for 507 years.
Greenlandn sharks are swimming down the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females are longer than dogs, they can grow up to over five meters.
As the growth rate is slow, according to the associations only about a centimetre a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
How long for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He determined the age of adult ice-creams from the 28 females that had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by radio-civering of eye lenses.
The average age of the case was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502-cent amazones, were exposed to the age of 335 and 392 years.
Since it has been found in previous studies that agnostics reach more than a square metre of fertility, researchers calculated that at that stage they were about 150 years old.
Thesis was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 people from Stockmann - no less than 300 sellers were taken off. No less than 300 sellers are being deducted.
Almost 300 employees are expelled from Stockmaa.
The joint ventures in a firm in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of these matches, about 300 jobs are reduced, the majority of which are executed as dismissals", Stockmann says in his communication.
According to that, the number of sellers in the goods sector is not reduced so that the customer service does not suffer.
In addition, around 80 employees of support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
There were about 3 000 employees involved in the first discussions on Stockmann.
At the time of their start, the reduction need was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction in the reduction is intended to cover about EUR 20 million per year of cost savings that will be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an effectiveness programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is that Stockmann’s difficulties are to make the commodity trade profitable.
Although the adjusted operating result of the group improved by EUR 11,1 million in the second quarter, the trade in goods continues to lose.
According to Stockmann v CEO Lauri Veijalainen, sales in the stores have not been subject to the company’s objectives.
"Also, unfortunately, it is necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail delivers positive operating results in 2018", Veijalainen states in the communication.
The result of the second quarter's performance improvement was, in particular, the good success of Lindex's supply chain.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4,1 million loss-making.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will decrease from the previous year.
The corrected operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.

The Kenyan public sports team is shaking a strange explanation for the attack of the Dopingskdaal coach coach.
Kenyan Public Sports Coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it became apparent that Anzrah was performing as a country team athlete in Doping test.
The news office AP told me that the athlete, when Anzrah tried to perform, is the 800-meter star of Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, head of the Kenyan national team leader, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to the attention of the authorities in Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he " committed a crime against Kenya's national team".
He appeared as a athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use", Kip Keino, President of the Kenya Olympic Committee, ran the news agency for Reuters.
The Olympics' public sports starts on Friday, and Roth is supposed to run right at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was established last year in the World Cup on the fourth quarter, and is an advance of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source inside the Kenyan public sports team claimed that Anzrah went through a athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in a racehouse.
When the anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," said the source.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sports fleet is empty in its void.
Where is everybody?
At least at the Olympic Stadium of Rio, they're not watching sports in general.
On Friday, Rio began a struggle for public sport medals, but the world's top people were able to present their skills to an empty viewer.
Rio's organisers said on Friday that only 58 per cent of the first day's breakfast tickets and 65 per cent of the afternoon's tickets have been sold.
There were four years ago in London, where the stadium was admiring people.
The final tickets are already sold in Rio.
Even before public sport, the Olympic Olympics have taken note of the fact that they are looking at the Olympic Olympics in Rio.
For example, thousands of empty pensions have been seen in the parks of rugby, melon and horse riding.
While Brazil's medals Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played a beach flight ball in legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the show was full of them.
After the Brazilian twinkish, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12 000 people's ratings were filled with about 30 per cent.
At least, bad business is explained by the fact that Brazil, which struggles in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian competitors, and many Olympics are strange to the Brazilians who used to play football.
In fact, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not have reached the full football stadium.
Mario Andrada, informing me this weekend that 82 per cent of the tickets were sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
"There's still 1.1 million left for sale," Andrada said after Reuters.
8,5 million tickets were sold from the Olympic Olympics in London, which cost nearly half of them more than in Rio.
The prices for tickets in Rio ranged from around EUR 9 to over EUR 1 000 for openings.
Over half of the flags pay less than EUR 16 per ticket.
In the Olympics in London, volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not allowed yet, because organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
However, in Rio, organisers have given 240 000 tickets to schoolchildren in less well-known species in the country, such as golf and rugby.
Rio's stadium had enough empty places this morning.
Even the beach-flying ball on the Copacabana sand has no interest in the audience.
Jukka Central Salo was a competition in London in 2012.
That's enough for a lot of magazines.
New way to protect nature - get the right to a rural rural area - Get the right to a territory
Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation through the newest means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically significant natural habitats.
After that, private, business and entities can redeem their right to land by means of money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from Lapland.
The country is virtually divided into blocks that are available to those willing to obtain right against payment of payment by the holder.
The administrator receives a right of veto of 187 square blocks, which means that in practice, each holder does not need to be approved if the destination of the land is to be changed.
Access rights can also be acquired for more than one lock.
The acquisition of a right of administration is something concrete that can be submitted as a inheritance or a gift.
There is no need to leave to carry a Bandero or chain itself somewhere to protect nature", Juha Levekkan, who has acquired control over his company, is founded by Juha Levekärkan, who has acquired control over his own company.
The acquirer receives accurate location information in his cell, which enables him/her to visit in a section, for example.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the holders of the right-of-occupied rights are on the same map as the country's parcel data.
The final fabric sees its nature conservation acquisition as a risk only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest for the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation would act somehow vaguely or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural habitats in such a way as to be inviolable and at peace.
The Foundation will acquire land either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights of the holder, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the Foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It also aims beyond Finnish borders and plans to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in pop up forest at the Helsinki Market Square on 13-19 August.
Wheel thieves torture large cities, worst of all, Turkey - look at the situation in your municipality of residence.
Cyclops torture Turkey from the great cities of Finland.
This year, more circles have been stolen in proportion to the number of inhabitants than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the bike thefts reported to the police, the number of bicycles and their parts per thousand inhabitants have been stolen in January to August of this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four out of five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police in Espoo and Couvola.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities, double thefts occur in proportion to the number of inhabitants compared to others", described Police Inspector Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why Turku has stolen more wheels than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The generality of the events can be influenced by how much traffic in the city is around the wheel and how much the wheel is at all", explains Sergeant Teemu Aikes.
The police government Tommi Reen is quite expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise at the top of the line.
The number of bike thefts is largely based on the number of cities of study and cycling.
There is a close centre in Turku, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city, where urban centres are away from each other, and bicycles are not necessarily a priority vehicle", Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police data in January to August have become slightly less of a bike theft than in the corresponding period of the previous year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the fall in recent years, the police will be informed about a limited number of more than 20 000 bike thefts per year.
It means 50-60 files every day and only in Helsinki for about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big quantities," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more of a spin because only some of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to report a crime as regards a bike theft, although less than one in ten cases reported to the police have been detected.
Typically cleared bike theft is the one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in his blood.
"There are also cases of other investigations where, for example, a stolen circuit can be found in a drug-related apartment", Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves will be caught weekly by the exercise itself or by police investigation, tell the senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheel is stolen, for example, from bicycles, indoor courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs, or practically everywhere where they are normally stored.
Individual wheel models are the most stolen like Jopos over the past few years.
The U-lock gives the wheel a better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves, for example for their own short-term use, are riding a wheel, but most of the stolen wheels end up being sold online, for example, for example.
They'll stay on the market.
"At least it hasn't come to the police that stolen wheels would go far beyond the country", Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of the stolen wheels are common Finns.
Some people probably buy a stolen bike, they don't know.
Some may have doubts about it.
The used bike buyer must be aware of the fact that he can commit a hidden crime or a violation of the law.
"The alarm bells should be called if a good-time bike is sold to its bottom," Reen says.
The filter editor, Mr. Severi Hirvi, always has a colourful Nops in Helsinki for his working day.
He's had five bikes, but none has been stolen, and the monster says, "It's never been taken, it's been a good monk."
"Maybe this does not attract thieves, this does not necessarily have a hipster value either," the Helsinkious monster wonders.
Libi Valve, who was quick to deal with the Kiosk in Helsinki Kallio, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the bike has been rocked against the wall of the box, but in general, Valve is locking his bike on something solid, like a bicycle line.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I've ever owned", the Helsinki student says about his white bike, whose body alone paid about EUR 5 hundred.
"All the time you hear from your friends that the wheel has been taken."
"Mostly bad bikes, such dirty boys."
On guard, a bike was stolen from the interior yard of a building company a year ago.
Although the bike had not been locked, Valve could wait for it to be evacuated.
Under 15-year-olds in charge of their crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-light crews known from the United States of America who are familiar with the United States of America.
In Helsinki, a so-called peer-review team is being tried to prevent young people from entering the criminal circle.
At first, the experiment is applied to persons under 15 years of age who are now subject to non-criminal liability.
The peer-responsor is the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer-review team will discuss what has happened with the offender and impose the penalty.
A week later, the offender himself may join the peer-review team in order to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may include, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
The Youth Executive Director, Tommi Laitio, tells us that the model is not tight.
We also have other compromise models that are used in parallel.
"All the activities of young people are directed in a more responsible direction so that they are not ruined by the first mistake", says Laitio.
A model for the vertex crew has been taken from the United States where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, not after his first crime, has to face the adult panel, but to reflect on what happened with the same age.
Models have been tested once.
A follow-up of the Services Industry Office in Palmu's service designer, Iikka Lovio, tells us that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes of persons under the age of 15 may not have been dealt with before at all.
"It's been a message that you go on the way you choose", Lovio says.
The peer-review team is part of the Helsinki project for immigrants, based on the City of Helsinki and Me- Foundation.
It points out that new practices are offered to all those who need it, not just to the immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican actors want the party to end the Trump campaign to fund the Trump campaign.
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
The letter was published by the US newspaper Politico, who had received a draft from it to see it as a draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, President of the Republican National Committee.
Signatures want the money of the party to be directed to Congress elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his recklessness, inability and infidelity, threaten to bring to the vote by these election Democrats," says Politico, the letter says.
Only direct direction of all possible resources to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning the Trump-created anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, since Trump's chances of winning the presidential election will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent over the next week.
Among those who have signed are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons organized by the letter is apparently the Republican Andrew Weinstein, the Republican against the Trumps.
According to the politician, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists several works by Donald Trump that are believed to have hurt millions of voters.
In addition, it is said that he has demonstrated dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 civil servants working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president of the Donald Trump.
Clinton's promise to make it a promising relief for families with children in the United States of America.
In the United States, the presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm going to be president so that the US economy would do well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would do well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
The Clinton Plan focuses on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve U.S. infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by a large amount of tax increases, in part by means of private money.
The building program is a handbook for American duvets who suffer from the transition of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme for the greatest investment in good paid jobs after World War II.
We are a construction nation, we must go back to building.
Clinton said.
Thursday Clinton also promised to facilitate the role of families with children who work.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders, pointing out that the rich should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be a tax liability, it must pay the tax on income tax, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he before supported.
"[ as President] I am opposed to all trade agreements that operate against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published prior to Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the financial programme published by the Republican Donald Trump on Monday by the Republican Donald Trump that it would "only favour millions of such ones".
The toughest proposal for a reduction in corporate taxes has ever been by Clinton to call the "Drumpin loophole".
Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded the listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump had not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself made in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making his own products in America", Clinton was hovering.
These are Rio viewer numbers: The races have not glued Finnish sides of the squares, but the mobile application is interesting.
Usually sports games can be seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Olympic Olympics in Rio have not reached the peak of ratings.
At least 12 per cent of the population have been glued at the top of the squares: on Tuesday nights, Yle followed 615 000 viewers from the Olympic TV2 at the same time as Yle’s Olympic TV2.
For the sake of comparison: one month ago, the EM races received TV2 at a time of almost 800 000 viewers, and football EM races fairly another million at a time.
Most of the Olympics have so far been interested in Sunday-night biking and the five-day tournament, both reaching almost half a million viewers at the Olympics channel at a time.
The Head of Yle Sports, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the number of viewers and recalls that viewers are divided for the first time by several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are going to choose the Olympics.
The TV2 and Yle Fem channels share the TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports games Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20 000 to 500 000, it is a good basis.
The figures are lower than in the 2012 London Competitions or in the 2008 Beijing Competitions, but the difference is explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's broadcasts will be in Finland during the night.
Another reason for a lazy interest - if someone thinks it's a lazy one - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken some kind of a surprise medal from the initials, the interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, sport is only beginning, as are other Finns interested species: sailing and horse riding.
According to Pokkinen, the initial ratings have been close to what was expected.
When sport starts, viewers explode.
Yle launched a competition for the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose on the first days of the races in Apple' App Store, Finland for the most downloadable free app.
By Monday, the app was charged 150 000 times.
I'd imagine that we're already on the way to 200 000 downloads.
"We'll get the numbers from the family's viewers only later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not been able to function as expected by all users.
Pokkinen says the feedback has come and the errors have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been using delay and other small technical problems early in life.
Applications have been made with updated versions that should correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio will be visible on Yle channel and arena more widely than any other sporting event ever before.
Some species can be monitored from the Yle Fem channel, and on the radio Yle Sound transmits races daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most working people ever for Yle, but also the last ones that can be followed only by Yle channels.
From 2018 Olympic sports will be seen on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is your Sun, whose depth is 95.3 meters on Crossside.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, Technical Reconstructor, found a weight of about 20 square feet [20 sq m] on the crossside, based on the deep depth of the dive computer, seemed 104 meters.
In the summer 2014 the Finnish Environment Centre was trying to confirm the observation in vain by means of an advocating.
The method may not be able to find a small depth of 100 meters, and development engineer Jari Hakala says.
So far, the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
The other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
More than 80 metres from Saimaa, Toisve and Lake Main.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Sun King's.
In particular, the base of Lake Inari has not been carefully investigated.
"There could well be unknown depths", Kannella wonders.
If deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As a result, your Chief will not be able to reach the ten deepest groups, and Suvasvea will be further away from the lead.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Revised last copy, where the deepest lakes were wrong at average depths.
About the age of tax: The tax on the tax of pensioners is still more severe than the tax on the tax on the tax on pensions.
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that there was a lack of respect under the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised equal treatment over employees.
This is not part of the Government's presentation.
We think it should definitely be.
The promises given should be shared after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received labour income reductions which reduced taxation.
The matter was heated by the opposition representatives, who had advocated the election promises of the Minister for Finance, Alexander Stubbia (Kok.) from the bridges.
Power is safeguarded, it does not grow.
According to Ihalainen, tax reductions are mainly due to security of purchasing power and not to increased purchasing power, as next year no wages will be increased.
He says that tax reduction will have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase the uncertainty of people.
Ihalainen welcomes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centrally) and Orpo's messages with the desire to respect the competitive agreement that has been reached with trouble.
He says that respecting the treaty is important for credibility..
It is the most important economic and employment policy of the government period.
It's done with the power of the social partners, so you don't have to question it by questioning it.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much for domestic demand and people's own future beliefs.
Long-term unemployment is affected by prolonged unemployment.
The person claims to the government that it would be in the budgetary line to catch the long-term unemployment rate, at least to stop its growth.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed was about 17 000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's objective of increasing the employment rate to 72% will be run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there is a very large social fall in the permit.
Ambassador: In Thai attacks, the Finnish victims are not reportedly known to be victims of Finnish victims.
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be monitored and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary for Thai intended Finnish servants to withdraw their journey due to explosions, but the embassy's instructions should be followed with caution, says Westphalen.
Very little Finnish Finns in Thailand in Thailand.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although it is difficult to estimate their exact number.
The Finnish Thai-Taiman travel period is scheduled for the change in the year.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
In particular, the Embassy has tried to help Finns in Hua Hin to get information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
Generally, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information about the author.
According to the Westphalen, there are still no data on the unsub of the attacks.
The Ambassador considers that events may be related to the political disparity of the Thai society and to the recent referendum on the constitution of the military train from last week's referendum.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict involving the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, previous attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphhalen.
According to him, the town celebrates the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
Traffic in the city is very small.
The impact of the attack on the day's course is that the authorities are very precise about safety.
Thai Police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also excluded, says Thai Police News Office AP.
There are at least four people who have died in Thailand during the day when 11 bombs have exploded throughout the country, such as tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the most popular tourist destination, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current information, they did not require death victims.
Exploded by two explosions from the city's paper, the day after the explosion, the day after the explosion, at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Chang Ngas, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
In the popular tourist destination Hua Hin, according to the local authorities, four bombs were bombed yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, in South Thailand, at the village of Surat Thani and the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in each of them.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, for it is transported to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao on holiday islands.
The author of the hit did not know what was known.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the ruling military train is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't let people panic anymore, he told the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Prime Minister for Security at least the attacks between Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the factors were intended to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finnish people in the country to be monitored and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and follow the instructions of the authorities.
It is not necessary for the Finns to withdraw their journey because of the explosions in Thailand, but it is worth following with caution, Westphalen says.
In vulnerable Europeans, vulnerable Europeans.
For the time being very little about attacks and victims during the night.
Last night's attack in Hua Hin has had time to get some more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded, there are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were wounded in Hua Hin's second strike.
Two bombs exploded as an invisible near the known bell tower.
Thai PBS reports that the police have isolated Hua Hin's territory from which it believes it has found another bomb.
Surat Than's bomb was placed in a flower bench according to the governor of the province.
An employee of the municipality died in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
CNN's interviewing police chief tells us that two bombs were used to attack Surat Thani as well, which exploded about half an hour every other day.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs blew up in front of two different police stations.
The United States Party won the women's four-game.
In the United States of America, Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and Russia's Alija Mustafina the third score of 58,665 points with performance.
Biles, 18, reaching out to Rio's competitions yet more tolls with perman, jump and boom.
Biles has been managing women's gymnastics to an extent in recent years.
He's had eight personal universes for the last three years.
Four matches and permanial champions he has won three times in a row as well as a boom in the last and the second year.
In a U.S. team, the Biles has achieved two team competitions in the world of the world.
It's a bit of a lot of wet, and it's a bit bit of fun at the party.
Thai Finnish entrepreneur: "The person has no influence on tourism".
Esa Huovila, a filmmaker in Phuket, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think it's going to be any more amazing, then the Finnish entrepreneur in Asia estimates Huovila, who worked in Asia for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedy that has tested Thailand in close proximity.
There's always something here.
At first there was a tsunami, then avian influenza and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these pastes haven't deported tourists, I doubt this one either.
The department of the Huovla Company is located a few hundred metres from the scene of the explosion.
The party heard about the blow from its own employees.
The employee called about nine local hours and said that you shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local workers arrived at the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to the Friday celebration in Thailand.
The tunnel was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at approximately 10:00 a.m. local time.
Many on the beach had never even heard of attacks.
By half at 3:30, Thailand's time in Patong had been normalized and most of the shops had opened their doors.
According to the site of the impact, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovola.
Later, this car was seen in Krunuka on Jouxholminie.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for recognition markings hiding in a close to six.
The other guy got caught right away.
The other one went away, but later he was found in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and serious damage to the vehicle.
The police thank you for giving me clues.
Research Director of Russia's leadership changes: Clear move aside.
In Russia, on Friday, a high-ranking political change took place in the years when President Vladimir Putin resigned his administration with Commander Sergei Ivanov.
The successor of Ivanov is Anton Vato, 44 years old, Estonian.
He's an ex-diplomate and acted as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from begging for the presidential independent authority for themselves.
According to Kangaspur, it is also possible that Ivanov has been involved in or screwed up with other executives.
Depreciation for Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of Putin's interior, moves to specific tasks in the environment and transport sectors.
By means of a tape presented by the State Media, Putin said that the change was a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another assignment and proposed that he would return, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov this is a clear fall in position.
Environment and transport are not very high in Russia's priorities.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian regime.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor of Putin in 2008, but he became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been replaced in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnyniemi from the Institute for Foreign Policy, says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place, is that Putin is becoming younger than his nearest circle.
The Isis warriors used civilians as human shields when they pulled out in Syria, Syria, Syria and Syria.
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to the city of Jarabulus to avoid targeting them, said Shefan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij military council of Manbij.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdish fighters received approximately 90 per cent of the important Manbij city of Daddy's country last week.
However, it is estimated that ten jihadids remained in the city at that time.
Revised the previous news at 7:30: In the past we reported wrongly that civilians were fleeing from the city, actually Isis fighters took civilians when they fled from the city.
Professor: Professor: The Legal Legal Act of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Ministry of the Interior is unlawfully unlawful.
The Ministry of Interior's guidance on the publication of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
The author tells STT that the disclosure of documents cannot be based on the authority's own policies, but is based on law.
The Ministry of Interior has previously refused to give up the list of participants in the meetings of the Minister for Interior to the Ilt-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision by the General Secretariat of the Government’s Office and the fact that the information was recorded on the Minister’s calendar and not on the accounting records.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has identified the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic Olympic show starts in Rio.
In the past few years, Bolt has been running against time under valuables.
He'd hurt the beginning of the year and left me with Jamaika's Olympic scars.
This hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been doing well, and that's the key to it, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed pillars dancers and fans of journalists who turned into fans.
On the other hand, there is a sign that the Jamaican star has risen during the period during which universal sport has fought with the doping scandals and the skating interest.
The last loss of Bolt at the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he sprung up in 200-meter primers at 21,05 p.m.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down injuries and loose exercise positions.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began on a hundred meters, in which he crushed the world record and the confidence of competitors during the 9,69 period, despite the end of the world record and the end of the competitions' confidence.
This is harder than it makes it harder harder harder to make it harder harder.
A year later, in the Berlin World Championships, Bolt achieved his career at the end of his career at the time of his watch.
World record in Berlin is still valid at 9,58 meters and 19,19 ts.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing a 200-meter world record and a 19-second subspace, but no one else believes that it is created but Bolt himself.
On a scale, Bolt's most challenging challenger is Athens 2004 100th Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year at the Beijing MM final, Bolt hit an American in just one hundred-six seconds.
The Bolt has not lost its worth in the finals in Beijing, for once, if only it has reached its way.
In Daegu 2011 the 100-MM final was left from Bolt to run without running for a wild start.
The store fills up a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the species of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
For the last time, Bolt has set the World Cup in London next year's World Cup.
These are the Olympics that tell me the difference between me and my memory.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm in the Netherlands, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sport Illustrated interview.
Unreports about Rio: two athletes are suspected of being suspected of doping crimes.
According to Xinhuan, Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Xinyi, 18 has produced a positive doping sample at the Olympics in Rio.
There were traces of prohibited substances found in the Doping Screen of Chen Xiny, Chinese farts.
Also, the Bulgarian drinks Silvia Danekova are suspected of doping crimes.
In addition, the Chinese Public Sports Coach was transported to my home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epi-hormone.
He was located in Rio, fourth in a 100-meter suit for women.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Esdao, the Chinese Ombudsman has taken his case of doping before CAS of the International Court of Appeal for Sport.
Xinhua reports that there were signs of hydrochlorothiazide diuretics in the sample given by Xiny on Sunday.
Other doping concerns have also emerged in Rio.
BBC announced that the Bulgarian women's drinks Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with signs of epo-hormon.
On the other hand, Kenya has passed Rio to the home of a public sports coach because of the doping exercise.
On Thursday, the International Olympics Committee KOK reported that the Chinese coach had developed in the test situation as a athlete and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is a Chinese express coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been in a situation with a 800-meter race pass from the Ferguson Rothh race passport.
Phelps will stop nothing... historic gold came into the display style to the display style.
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, U.S. Michael Phelps swims out of 200 metres in the middle of the 200-metre period, the 22th Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic Games.
At the same time, Phelps reached the first swimming pool of the same species in fourth consecutive races.
The Phelps winning time was 1.54.66.
In Japan, Kosuke Hagino was located in a mixed land, second before China's Wang Shu.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, but Helen Skkelton's Olympics commentator, Helen Skkelton, is laughing at the evening press's quick interview.
The case made on Monday from Helen Skelton is one of the most listed on this week's website in the Official Journal.
Next commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skkelton is not much stressed if soms or British dances have a small cone of his revealing and special costumes.
After all, the television is visual media, and he's stressing it.
Skkelton is dressed in high-ranked shoes and a short dress that will certainly have at least enough openness to the eyes of at least many conservative Britishists.
However, no back steps are permitted.
It's important to look good, and small trials are just a fun thing.
Skkelton certainly wants to impress you, and maybe he's upset, but he's insisting that he doesn't want to be the lead player.
This isn't about me, he says.
I'm here to watch sports, and the focus should be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how much I dress up.
Can you imagine that the court's been all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how much these swimmers are doing and how big the sacrifices they're making, is for me, Skkelton cheers me up.
You know what?
It's all about nothing if it comes from wearing (the driver) clothes.
I'm just a little excited if something like this has hit someone's radar.

The Argentina lady fell down on Peitta-Siren - Finnish lady wondered about the protest.
The wind at the Peitta-Siren had a colorful day to race in Rio.
The wind of Peitta-Sire's cake was hard on Thursday.
The Argentina lady fell into Tuuli Peitta-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant accepted the breach.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others ran away, Joakim Wilenius, Finland's chief coach, told me.
A sportsman was considering a long time of protest.
It was not worth doing so because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should've dropped the water so I could've got a refund, Petja-Siren said.
Finnish hanged on to the last minute because they didn't want to go into Rio's dirty water.
With the accident, a Finnish person stayed left instead of leaving 27.
In the overall situation, London’s 2012 Olympic Championship is eight.
The cholera of suffering did not have much effect on the cholera of suffering.
Friday is an important day when you're going to race from 10 to 12 to 12 Friday.
By way of derogation from the first knowledge, Peitta-Siren did not make any protest.
7 special things, which, according to science, extend their age.
Science has researched everything possible between earth and heaven.
These issues have been proven to bring extra years to the life of a person.
There are some ways that directly or indirectly affect the health of a person so that his life is extended.
At times, things that a person himself cannot influence may be brought to him for additional years.
These include, among other things, the tendency to medium- body meat or social status.
Regular shopping may take longer than age.
There's always no need to break up - just get enough milk cans.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out many different studies.
The Medical Daily presented seven strange results of the survey.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Beverage of beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against certain cancers, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
The University of Harvard research noted that moderate consumption of coffee is linked to the "lower risk of death", especially in relation to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Again, on behalf of the alcohol, the studies show that a reasonable use of one of the three daily doses may lead to a longer life.
For example, one found that wine drinks lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of a toothpaste may extend the life of a person for up to six years, one study explains.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other parts of the body.
The Norwegian survey found out how laughing affected human life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 55,000 people.
Those who laughed more were the most scary people 35 per cent more likely to survive after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when gender-based protection is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
In addition, it can also extend age.
Unfortunately, it is not enough just to have sex on its own.
In order for a person to have additional years of life, he should also receive orgasm.
Mobility will, of course, bring additional years, it will not be contested.
However, the achievement of a long age does not require absolute socialism.
One study at Oxford University found that women with a big butt had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with a lower mortality rate.
Whether it was a athlete or an actor who won Oscar in the Olympics, he is likely to live longer than ordinary bulls.
Many studies have tried to find the reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to more years.
Some researchers, once again, suspect that a long age is due to the social status of a person - which, for its part, makes it possible, for example, to pursue such recognitions as the Nobel Prize.
A survey on the purchasing behaviour of people over 65 years of age found that a person shopping daily, i.e. probably less than the parent making purchases, found that he/she is more likely to be a parent who makes purchases.
This is because circulation in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has once again been declared to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause death to occur.
So the credit card with your hand on the internet is not the same as that on your computer.
The dark-human railway station in the driveway swept a truck in the direction of a truck.
On Friday night, the Koske, Varsinais-Suomi, had a heavy truck and passenger car ring.
The accident took place at Koskel, Koskeden and Sorvastonet on Friday at 2 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car arrived had run along the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
The truck was turned upside down after the crash, but it turned on fire.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car was swept away and then passed over its roof.
In 1972, a woman who was born with a passenger car stayed in her car and was crushed.
The rescue facility was removed from the car of the injured driver and transported to Turku University Hospital.
The result of the women's blow test was 2.0 percentages.
He's suspected of a brutal rat-judder.
Mail mail sent out scraps to the wrong city to send the wrong city.
Salon K-Citymarket had deficiencies in the bulk of candy, because the mail had delivered part of the load by accident to the Seinäjoki River.
Teija Haltia, who lives in the family, was on Thursday shopping for scraps from Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign got caught in the eyes.
Unfortunately, they have product deficiencies because Posti delivered our loads to the Wall River.
We'll get more when the mail gets the load delivered.
So if you don't run around in a lawn cut, you read the sign.
The sign that we've been shopping for the merchant is that the Posti extended its services last spring to include grass cutting.
The food harvest is served by Post until the end of August.
He said that the village was mostly amusing and decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me off the alarm.
The media representatives have been calling all the time, and the point raised by this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia was over 700 shares on Facebook.
Halti got their favorites caught in a bag of broken candy, even though a few sheets were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, responsible for the management of the transport services of Post Enterprises, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that from the five stage, three were deceiving into the wrong place yesterday (Salo) and we were no longer going to make a partial delivery (Salo) on three, but we were only taking five sets today, Kadesoja told Ilt-Sanom about the evening.
It's the first thing to know about the evening-Sanomas.
Teija Haltia was not upset about the sign because he found all of his favorite kits in the selection.

During the three-month period, the number of pounds fell eventually by five.
The hope of a murdered woman’s family in the permit of a murdering woman’s hope: Remembering the victim for police dogs: Remembering the victims for the good of the police dogs.
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovija hopes that the victim should be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation for police dog work.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute for work at Sipoon Veterinary Station and had also performed his nurse training there.
The vet station remembers her with words that touch her.
Happy, smart, sense of humor, and work unaffordable.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations may be transferred to.
The update mentions that donations go to police dogs as a whole, primarily to obtain safety tapes.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovinian woman was murdered in her own backyard in the Lovika Kosküla.
The female neighbors have said to the evening paper that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
The 27-year-old man of the murder didn't know a woman and they didn't have any contact with each other.
The killer's tracking involved a police dog Börje, who was seriously injured in an arrest situation.
But the bike survived, and it's getting better.
The King Court gave Post a judgment on infringement of equality law in respect of an infringement of the equality law.
The mail did not have the right to arrest the salary of a worker who refused to apply for a temporary worker, and it was not in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Kanta-Häme.
The right of benefit was imposed on Post to pay the employee most of the paid salary and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a part of the employer's salary corresponding to the entire day's work.
According to the right of treatment, the employee had been placed in a more unfavorable position on the basis of his trade union activity.
The staff member had complied with the PAU’s decision of organisation in the postal and logistics sectors.
During the last November postal strike, PAU made a decision that Post employees would not be familiar with the temporary workers who had broken the strike.
The matter was first reported by the People's News.

Putout separated his administration from the head of the head in the state-of-the- hand position of the state-of-the-art Pato Päoto.
The President of Russia Vladimir Putin has been resigned by Sergei Ivanov, President of the President-General, who has been told by the Kml.
The place will be President of the Communist Director-General of the Soviet-Viron Karl Vato's grandson Anton Vato.
Pato is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Deputy Head of the Board of Presidents since 2012.
The persecution is also due to be a member of the Russian Security Council, and the Interfax News Office tells us about it.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
Ivanov, a member of the close interior of Putin, will, according to Kremlin's information, move to specific tasks in the environment and transport sectors.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed that he would return, as told by Russia Today.
Ivanov worked together with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB spying on KGB.
Many considered Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but as President, Dmitri Medvedev rose.
Ivanov was appointed as President in 2011 before Putin’s re-election as President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's jackpot for a game ban will not be seen at Valioliiga's opening.
The world record man of football transfers does not see the field when the UK Valialiga is kicked into the weekend.
Paul Popban's non- playing ban followed English.
The giant acquisition by Manchester United is because of a game ban on the page ManU opening his league against Bournemth on Sunday, said BBC Friday.
ManU paid Pogbasa to the Italian Society Juventia EUR 105 million, according to the British Media.
However, the FF FF of England keeps him out of the game, because Pogba was left under the responsibility of the Juvenile to ban the game.
He received two warnings from last season at the Italian cup, and it becomes one match of a game ban.
That game ban has been moved to England, FA told BBC about it.
Pogban's next seam to play is the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow's the size of the madness is the virtue of virtue.
The precise criteria for entertainment and ambitious visions have established the status of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event that is aimed at world top maps.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
The painters have typically expressed themselves in their own personal dress.
One of the artists on the main stage is this year a punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The event area of the Flow Festival will be staged with artificial grass and art installation, among other things.
It has never been enough for us to just have a headset and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival held this weekend in the Summer Hall of Helsinki has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors.
The background to success is a simple question: What kind of event would authors themselves want to go?
It's quite different in the event of an event, that's what I'm thinking.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the rules of authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would also be here this year to sell to the end.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors in the last year with 5 000 people.
There are also a number of interesting Finnish and foreign artists this year.
The increase in the number of visits is a good thing because things have to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd that will be controlled in the huge highways.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of a successful event has been increased over 13 years in such a way that there are 130 performers, art instincts and numerous restaurants and drinks in a partially artificial grass-frozen area.
In addition to the major and smaller levels of occurrence, this year there are 15 000 people in the area.
Kallio admits that the event could take place more simply than that.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done is that today, too, great visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki about 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of the company running Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can bring about 'cress stories', like the construction of that 73-meter wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in their own personal dress.
In addition to the music event, you can talk about the trendy group of young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled into a particular fashion.
Above all, we want to break up with content.
Even so, fashion phenomena match Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the artists of the main stage is a legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge group of fans in his own generation, but he doesn't have the most typical performances of his own.
According to Kallio, Iggy was busy because this is probably the last time this is happening in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
It's not just what's playing on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest album is damn good, and he's been doing damn good jobs in recent years.
The bombs in Thailand's tourist paradise bombs were hidden in flower bags... the tourists fled in fear of their terror.
Hua in Hini blew up a local time on Thursday night two bombs.
At least one local woman died and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower bag and blew up using cell phones.
Bombs were placed on the street, most of whose clients are foreign.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists began leaving bars and returning to their hotels, told the police representative, Samoer Yoosumran CNN.
From 1989, the protectionist Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, wrote about your attacks a big picture of the blows.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it from here.
There were at least 11 foreign tourists who were injured in Hua Hin.
The people came running and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It was one of the biggest bar blocks, and she told Emelie Olsson Aftonblade about the Swedish cruiser.
The next morning, local time blew up two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Soon after this, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket as well as the Finns prefer the island of Phuket.
No one's obviously dead.
At the same time, a second double-bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
In addition, one bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb on Hua Hin that hadn't been able to blow up yet.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities' estimates, there may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been involved in the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KKML: This part of the new stand-by troops will be launched in a war situation first to fight.
In an acute war situation, backups are ordered to combat only several months after the military light swears, reports Central Finn.
According to Prime Minister Jukka Sonninen, the Head of Defence Forces, who has been interviewed by the Lehden, for example, for 5.5 months of staff serving in military situations, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible for battle.
According to the training manager, the service is first set up by reserve members of the emergency teams.
No backup or reserve personnel shall be ordered to perform a post without required training, says Sonninen.
In the summer before, it appeared that Defence Forces were about to train the guards to immediately prepare themselves for immediate preparedness services from the beginning of next year.
If necessary, the units may be used in military operations during emergency staff training, if necessary.
Pamela Tola received a giant earrings from the home house from the home house.
Actor Pamela Tola and his former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a rough fight from the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The purchase price of two-stored houses had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious moisture problem in the house that caused health-threatening microbiological growth.
The municipality was forced to sell a dwelling in the form of a landing capacity in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma increased to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the case and asked the seller to pay the price.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the tip and the bet.
The court of court issued the judgment in the case on Wednesday.
It held a judgment in the Court of First Instance which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction of EUR 150 000.
In addition, the seller will have to pay the costs of the trial and settlement of the panel totalling EUR 47 344.
The court decided a little about the price reduction because some of the need for the repair of the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when they made the sale of housing.
However, according to the court law, the manifestation errors were essentially more serious than what had been presented.
Tola is looking for a nice home.
Tola told me in a long time that the couple had been looking for a good home because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had been given the impression that the building had been renovated and was in good condition and that there were no harm in the matters mentioned in the fitness check report.
The fitness check report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of sufficient water management for flooding and melting.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear to have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma were left with the idea that the rainwaters from a rock should perhaps be controlled a little over a few years.
In October 2009, trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the moisture problems of the apartment were much more serious than they thought.
The audit carried out in 2012 and 2013 found microbiological growth, according to the Witnesses, due to both the rainwater and the capillaryly raised land soils.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector, have been estimated to have reached indoor space via the bus as well.
A homeroom, a basement stairs, a living room window counter and a basement washroom was found in the petals of a teahouse, a minibar, a living room with a living room.
The premises were built without permission.
The court also held a dispute as to whether or not the dwelling was in violation of the extended building permit.
The court held that the Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of the City of Espoo to make changes to the residence authorisation.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, although there were no suitable permits yet.
However, the problem with the home was a fundamental matter in court.
According to the court law, the purchasers could expect from the seller, on the basis of the information received prior to the sale, to assume that the building was suitable for living itself and that in the nearest time there was no need for measurable repairs.
In the opinion of the Court of First Instance, Tola and Waroma did not have to carry out a more extensive examination of the usual situation.
The buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to report, the court court shall rule in its judgment.
Rough archive: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to raise children for the Nazis - also Finns in the register.
Journalist Christopher Andersson writes in a recent article on how microfilm documents have been stored in the National Archives in Maryland, United States, covering a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted Nazi mosaics.
The documents and licenses are derived from a breed agency operating in Nazi Germany.
The breed agency served as SS leader under Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been studied by a SS doctor.
The same was true for women who had to be able to give birth to even more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate the matter.
The breed agency cleared the backgrounds of women by examining church books, among other things.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female family tree.
The women were also supposed to be prepared to give up Swedish citizenship and give the Racial Office a well-defined life cycle and good recommendations from close relatives.
The Office wanted guarantees that women were "children", "saper", and "good nationalists", who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as the bride of SS men.
The case does not tell us how 14 Finnish women who found the archives in the documents were found in the file.
The SS Directors set up a state-funded programme known as Lebensbor in 1936.
Among other things, the programme provided that each SS man should have four children, either in or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, on the pages of the U.S. holocaust Museum.
Instead, the national demographic policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged the marriage by providing loans and support for the provision of children.
A German mother's honorary was granted to women who had received at least four children.

Jari Sillapää sattulinna was recorded on a couple of hours' nights, "I was so in a bag".
Jari Sillapää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From a cruise ship's pub to a 1995 tangokin, Finland's best sales solo artist, and Silapää, who became the star of the dancers and the festival, can continue to be dirty, and is currently in a huge increase at the moment.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Marippinen, on the life of a favorite singer, was published on Thursday morning.
In the book Silkhead tells about his life and career as good as he does in evil.
The career on the top of the head rose into a total uprising during his victory at the Wall River Tango market in 1995.
In the contest Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopopamaski had written to Sillapää, at the request of a man, a tango piece, which Kasu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
As a result, the piece of satunna rose into one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Silanapap sang it on the tape in a horrific hangover and only after a few hours of night sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in the bag.
The head of the head remembers in the book.
To the contrary, you wouldn't immediately think it was singing in a hangover.
Even though I wasn't physically best, the trail was still good.
I learned that all the time, you don't have to insist on yourself being perfect and top right now.
One of the most popular events of a man’s story, about which the book describes, happened almost twenty years later.
In 2013 Silanpää resigned from his partner, and the case ended up in the end You also earned a gold piece of text that was published as single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sarah Törmäsäs were not the kind of song She would have liked.
On the other hand, he had imagined that he was making a record telling the truth about his own life, but the words of the song telling the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of the 7 day magazine.
In the news, the difference between Jar and the ex-lover was reported as the reason for Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but according to Jar's, it was full of pussy and it wasn't true.
According to the book, Jari called an angry record company and refused to sing a song, but eventually ended up singing it and so on.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52 per cent of voters were favoured by the difference and 48 per cent would have remained in the Union, although the opinion of the week of the vote would expect the opposite result.
Britain's economies and economic institutions were almost unanimously in favour of staying in the EU.
No respected research institute or university issued a distinction, although a few individual researchers may disagree with the current power of their profession.
The theme 'It's the economy, the stumps', of the former US president Bill Clinton's election campaign, was a scrapped by the British Brexit vote.
Economis were shocked when they didn't hear their voice.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
It's an economic curfew.
The Centre for Macroconomics is responsible for the Brexit disaster in its latest six-month period.
The most typical answer is that no economists were heard and heard, because this time the voters took a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation of the econisms' loss of economic status is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of employed persons, almost constant then.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the right British.
Many people also have the idea that a decrease in the value of currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the EESC, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the agreement of the economis did not sufficiently come up with the agreement.
In particular, they were driven by the balance of BBC, which gave just as much space to only a few percent of economic scientists from the economimist community who were in favour of the EU gap as an overwhelming majority.
There was no interest in the EU-wide press in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE had to say about the consequences of the distinction between the difference between the EU's power books and the other economic power books.
Those far-off combinations of letters were a face-to-face talk of economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the Econists were both listened and understood, they were ignored because the Economis represent an elite with which voters do not have common interests in their own view.
The academics of big cities such as Economis would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also a economy.
The overwhelming victory argument in the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant will take your job, the immigrant will cause your hospital to incinerate you, the immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked out.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have in the papers if they left? How much more jobs would there have in the papers if they left?
Every health centre in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctors if they weren't there?
There are also children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would the real British children get to a school if they got rid of them?
In each municipality, foreigners live in foreign countries.
How much more room would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the econists failed to respond and, if they did, their responses were not visible.
The econisms failed to explain that immigrants make immigrants more jobs, less health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are British net contributors and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen Property Fund of Aberdeen was prepared for Brexit with cash cash in Brexit.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were responsible for Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen had early reservations at Brexit on the development of plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the camp in favour of the EU difference, started to be more specific for a few weeks before the vote in case the result was overdue.
It was a concern that investors would start pulling their funds off the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but now they might be necessary.
We were going to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen's only open daily open-air real estate fund that was the news about.
According to the elderly, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the Fund was 3.5 billion pounds.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately 20 billion.
It was the highest number of nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all the British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained 10% or even below it.
So the real estate funds were prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds will close off trading.
When the camp in support of the EU gap won, Europe went a long way.
However, less than two weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney's speech by the Governor of the Central Bank, where he considered that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition to real estate funds, the first, Standard Life, has frozen its trading.
Together, these guys got off the hook and raised the matter to the main sections of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors after one another.
The Aberdeen situation was good because of the collected cash, but it also eventually had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually close the deal, but they changed prices down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out in panic.
The message from Aberdeen was that, if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it because it would cost you losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of the notifications cancelled.
Since then, it has been quite smooth, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner European Fund has had no similar droughts.
However, there was a lot of polls.
I unduly undue undue due due due due undue attention to real estate funds's real estate funds's attention to real real real estate funds's attention to real real estate funds's attention to real estate funds.
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds’ trading became extremely much of the attention of the elderly.
The open funds covered by the closures are managed by approximately four per cent of British real estate.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties of 80 properties of its property in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might hold its funds to the end of 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not seem to be "more important" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty that the situation has brought some of the real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen notes.
The rate of pounds and dollars is below 30 years, and the market also has a 15% discount in relation to the time before the Brexit vote.
Now, the dollar leader can buy the same property at a lower cost of up to 30%.
There's a lot of fancy buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines to London's real estate market in London.
The situation didn't seem so much like it last night.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, a British real estate fund, responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
Well, that's where you got the power word.
I realized that this was going to go to Plan B's, and Vanhan says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already completely alive after breakfast.
The normally silent TV lines at the office supported the news, and usually the loud people were silenced to listen completely when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screenheads flashed red and red.
It was the morning that would never have believed he was alive, Old says.
It is not because, despite the mines, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in the United Kingdom, finished two real estate trades on the day following Brexit's vote, i.e. as a train.
The feeling was confused.
However, the company had been well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was sort of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started at the start of a correction
The storm followed the vote.
It all went down, the British leader went into exchange.
The market was expected to have massive invoices for the real estate market in Britain, in particular in London.
Up to 20% of mines were expected at London's office premises in the coming years.
Soon, a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the mermaid is down, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
It does not appear to have the last summer holidays this week in Helsinki on Old Town's face.
He thinks it's too early to say a lot about what's going on with Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts, for example, to the situation.
The development of the London real estate market has already gained first information from the development of the London real estate market.
The information provided by CBRE on price developments is about one third of the market.
According to them, prices of all properties in London decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, the deficit increased by 6.1 per cent, and the old man reads.
The figures aren't that terrible, but they're months away.
The monthly index was published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Oldman.
All the same rises occurred in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is interesting, therefore, that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall in Lehman and the global economic crisis on the U.S. real estate market.
In the opinion of an old man, the comparison is not quite a good one, as it is now a UK-based crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales such as that time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
The money is also available normally.
In any case, the repair movement could have been ahead in any case.
In fact, the price correction is not a miracle of him - it could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen’s estimates, real estate prices in London and other world cities have been too high for many years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices have been overrated, says Vanhanen.
So the fall started very high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, as have London's population.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last property class that globalizes, Vanhanen says.
New players have come into the market in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for property investments abroad.
London is a well-known city with an easy destination.
In addition, prices have been increased by low interest rates, for example, pension companies have had to look for returns on new sites.
This loan has been readily available - although Vanhas says that the debt gap is now clearly less used than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Split, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread, spread,
In London, the rise in prices went up last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also started to reduce its ownership in London, and it was last year a net salesman.
There was some sort of a turn, and now it came.
What forward forward from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
She's not afraid to judge the future, but she's saying there's hardly any upheaval on her own.
The feeling suggests that there is a calculated or even going ahead.
The old man has already seen several movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimism who believes that the dome will be survived by work.
If you are well prepared to take risks, you will be better placed.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one of the markets, there's too much of its victims.
If you've split up, the risks are also decentralised, old man says.
The S-group will begin to register more more information about shopping information.
The S-group knows what you're eating, as the trading company told me today that it is starting to gather more accurate information about the purchases of its clients.
As far as the total amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will begin to hug it on the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-group is here following Kesko, because the goods purchased on the plus card have been collected in Kesko's customer register for a few years.
According to Ismo Riitasta, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used as an authorisation for marketing.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have banned the use of product information, Riitala says to Economicsnom.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to the change in registration of the S Group.
According to only the purchases of food, Kosko already classifys its client as 10 groups.
The rating shall be updated monthly.
The applicants are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they spend on them.
The data are used for targeted marketing for the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer support programme and does not have any plans for this purpose.
A Finnish retail has its own YYKösbonus customer support programme, which can be associated with the selected houses, SiWok and Euromarkets.
At present, we do not collect product or product group-level data, we maintain a receipt at the level of the total amount.
So we know where the purchase was made and the day before and the total amount of the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to that level as the K-group or the S-group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the programme is intended to be reformed in the future, but it will be discussed later on by the Czech Republic.
However, the Ora does not permit registration of the product information.
At first, experimenting is a start-up experiment.
The SOK customer and customer register has so far been relatively large.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also included occupation, training, housing form, birth years of children and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role is registered.
The purchase of S-Euth cards has been recorded on the date and time of purchase, place, total purchase, and method of payment.
In addition, S-bonus partners’ information is derived from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will start to be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, data are currently recorded at product group level.
Customers have long been looking forward to a more detailed focus on marketing, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer and Partner Activities of SOK, Sok.
The S-group says that they are informing their customers about the change they make to their customers.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, data are stored in cats in any case, whether they wish or not.
You may want to check the stored data on the S-Group website.
For example, cashiers do not access the information, stress Saikoski.
Video: Heila-kiss is Customs's latest dog confirmation - the plating will become the first explosive dog dog.
The black Labrador driver's puppy strongly grazes five similar boxes set in lines of the country at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long when it's determined to sit next to the middle drawer.
Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila Dog by playing it with his favorite toy.
The box, next to which Heila sat, revealed a jar of shells occult on the square gas.
The rocket gas is the first smell Heila has been trained with, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila Dog.
Security situation and access to online shopping
Heila is the first dog that specialises in the search for weapons and explosives and is placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
Tasks may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heila because the international security situation has changed in Europe due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
In Customs, the attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures and surveillance, says Mikko Grönberg, the customs inspector.
Another access to the training of weapons and explosives for Customs duties is postal transmissions transiting through Helsinki Airport.
With an increased internet trade, up to 40 million mail consignments are transferred annually via the airport, including foreign ordered weapons and explosives.
Over the last few years, customs has made some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives available at Helsinki Airport for purchase of online shopping goods, baggage and air cargo of passenger machinery and air freight, as well as for their source materials.
Heila will work all over Helsinki Airport.
It will examine recorded travel goods and mail.
In the future, it will be of great benefit if it can go through large containers and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of their performance, Customs estimates whether more weapons and explosives drivers will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful about the idea.
School at the Kingdom Hall
The education of the Heila-pen is coordinated by the Finnish School of Dogs of Customs, which is located in the church district.
The mission will also attend training with Heila to the police and defence personnel.
Police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to identify.
They will always be trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
On the Helsinki Airport, colleagues are six drug dogs from Customs, as well as cash and drug dogs from Massi.
Labradorian Heila has been chosen for the ten puppies of a puppy.
The selection criteria for a dog that is selected for the airport include a hole in and a hunting principle, as well as peace because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntion, is a close friend to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nothing without Heila gets home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle orders go up to Heila from a single sheet.
The security guard in the evening-Samom camera loses a quick camera for a dog's mike shield, but Heila restores the protective shield from a soft toy immediately from the "irti" command.
Work hard competition.
They'll be pre-schooled next year.
There are still levels of tests ahead, next in October, when it is estimated that training is sufficient for the required tasks.
They will be able to see their work in Helsinki Airport in the next half of next year, if everything goes as planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come here to iron a dog wearing a working vest, recalls Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year for customs duties.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owner.
The working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active contributions will last only from ten minutes to a few hours.
The owners of the workers are very competitive in Customs.
Heila's owner was looking for approximately 20-30 employees of Customs.
The luck hit Suntio, who has never had a working dog before, but he has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Customs.
The country's first Olympic medals - the nation's people will have a holiday day.
In rugby, the Olympic Games of under a million people in Fiji, the country is so high that the government has appointed the 22 August national holiday day.
According to the nation's public broadcaster, the Fiji Government confirmed the matter after the end of the championship.
The day after the team returns home the next day.
There are also solemnities for the hero team in their own country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian tells us that the country was followed by the finals in the capital of Suva, where a screen was set for the stadium.
Normally only the Natives of Fiji are interested in rugby, but this game was associated with our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them encouraging, said Maiikele Seru Guardian, editor of Fiji Times.
Dramaa in Rio, Damaa in Rio - the Finnish player fainted after a wild execution.
The presser, Miko Tokola, succeeded in the last attempt to reach 175 kg after a hard battle.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the cracks, he has been stunned several times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola scored 175 kilos and 145 kilos of force.
His income was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her into the last 175 kilos of her salary, as well as the other one.
In the third attempt, the weights rose as a result of a wild screaming.
The body was suffocated under weight until the judge accepted the lifting.
The delight of the Finnish publisher was that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired an Estonian benefiter with Prosan - Veikkausiliiga - Ilta-Sanomat - Ilta-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing at the football league of men, has concluded a lasting agreement with Albert Prosa, the official beneficiary of the season.
We are looking for a top player in our team that has power and whose threshold is small for Finland and Rovaniemi.
Over ten players and I went through a lot of 50 players around the world.
The small-scale group began to be a good alternative to Prosa, coach of RoPS, Juha Malinen, reported on the bulletin.
Prosa, 25, arriving in RoPS from a stable in Flora where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
The Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis meet the ruling Finnish master SJK.
RoPS came to need a new attacker when last year's secular queen Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family Star will once again turn around again: teen-star short shorts reveal almost everything.
With the help of the Modern Family comedy series Alex Dunphyna became familiar with Ariel Winter will go off again by presenting his proud body again.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minishors, who don't leave much imagination behind.
The shorts revealed not only the actress's legs but also the back of this.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently raised attention by changing style and behavior significantly more courageous.
The star has scored several tattoos in images published in social media in very small clothes and has taken a large number of tattoos.
Young woman has also seen her dress up in very little costumes.
Winter, who is at the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating himself.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it from here.
Earlier this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed its public picture so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a "typical Hollywood transformation" from the child star to adult.
He's been on TV almost his whole life and he's grown up during the Cardashian era.
He has learned that the more to show the exposed surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer says to Fox News and more that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has been stunned by part of his long-term fans with his image shift.
It is not hard to guess where she is in ten years, when the minor is already so hard, says a woman on Winter Instagram.
On the other hand, part of a woman's fans defends an actor and urges to ignore criticism.
You look great.
I don't care what the others say.
You are inspired by many women, by a young woman.
The Japanese want the Nordic countries to prefer to go to Finland - tourists are attracted with a resort: In the autumn it is possible to see a random millor aurora.
The purpose of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their rest trips, Visit Finland tells us about the information.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese recreational tourism.
Revon lights are the capital cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly linked to the heart stone and snowy landscapes.
In the winter of Lapland, there is a very high demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of trips to autumn.
It is rare to know that the season starts early in autumn and goes on to spring.
In the autumn it is possible to see so-called millror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the renovation of the vision of two stories of the random, explaining in the information Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Rehabilitation campaign is the rich 25-35-year-old, Japanese women living in the city who dream of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland by online advertising, among other things.
According to a survey carried out by Aalto University and universities of Turku and Tokyo researchers, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the Japanese population compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see clearer unique sights from Finland, and according to Lindi, this revival has enormous potential.
The number of nights spent by tourists in Japan has increased considerably more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed more than doubled in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than €80 million in Finland.
On average, Japanese people used EUR 183 per day in Finland, Lind says.
Great Britain is pleased with the master's course of Rubbyhohpea Fidi, led by gold.
The impressive progress of the United Kingdom in the rugby tournament came to a final challenge by Fedz at Thursday night's final when the team experienced 43-7 crush kills at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organised a master's course for processing, chewing, stalking, supporting, running and silking when they won gold - their first Olympic medals.
That was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver medalist - the third day of Britain - and they were proud of their hard work in the start-up tournament of the Olympic rugbys in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
In the past, the hard 7-5 victory in South Africa, which was played the same day, could have hurt them in the finals.
But despite this, Fidi would have won a team of 15 top-level teams in this condition.
The British may perhaps - but probably not - comfort that at least one of the Britishs has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fidi's chief coach is Ben Ryan, British's former boss from Wimbledon.
Great Britain's journey has been quite a long way to go.
Eight years ago, when Ryan was trained, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
They only lost one here.
This is the back pain, but progress is shocking.
Fidi began well to combat the British tariff quotas for interest.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running toward moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinsau dived in the corner of the goal area.
When there were four minutes at the time, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side was a goal shot.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant jacket stopped him from doing the third goal of Leone Nakarawa, but it was just slow for Fid.
For seven minutes Jasa Veremalua scored the right corner, and the United Kingdom had 17-0 lost.
Nakarawa scored again on a new initiative, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock... the first half time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouuuou rushed through the British found agglomerations and then rushed into the line to make a goal.
After the earthquake, the situation was 29-0 when we went to break.
It seems like Fidi was born to play rugby, whereas the United Kingdom just learned the game.
And that's what it is.
In a break, the United Kingdom made changes that blocked Fidi's dam... for four minutes, which compared to the first half of the period was good until Joshua Tuisova scored Fidi after an impressive pitching game.
Dan Norton scored to the United Kingdom in the left corner of Touchdown and narrowing the situation to number 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, squealed flags and danced in the sights.
It was difficult not to admire Fidi's joyful approach.
Mata Vilime's last-minute finish was a load of Fidi's cake, which didn't have to be peeled.
The speech was made, the Fidis were hugging, and the United Kingdom fell for a lawn, completely hit.
On the same day, Fidi had hit Japan in semi-finals 20-5, and the United Kingdom won South Africa in a strict semifinal, where each of them made one goal - the British goal shot solved the game.
Kyle took South Africa to lead in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a dazzling footwork and scored under the goal poles in the second half of the time.
It's a great late guarantee from Marcus Watson, the 15-side-rugby team in England from Anthony's brother, to ensure victory and finally a silver medal.
Coach's battle against cancer forced Helen Glover and Heather St St St Sting to battle the coach's battle against cancer.
In these races, there will be no feelings of more disgusting gold, and it will really mean something.
From the first bet to the last 220 hard races towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning at the Estacio da Lagola as of their golden moment.
While they were alone, there were three votes on the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time, when the twin had his second consecutive Olympics in a couple of women's contests - the first women in British sports history books, which are at the top of such a achievement.
Their management was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also recordable.
This, what we see, is two great athletes joining the surface of a spring with a tightness, not a complete picture of the nature of victory.
There is a group of helpful handkerchiefs in the background of each row that will gradually promote the things that are relevant, and none of the handkerchiefs were as essential as the coach who, 30 months ago, had been diagnosed with cancer, knew whether he would live until now.
Like he said, the situation was a long shot.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things to cut, and they did surgery.
If they don't cut, it spreads everywhere.
The situation could have been pretty bad.
That's a little change in your thinking.
Williams received a diagnosis in December 2013.
The third was the fact that his treatment was possible at the beginning of 2014 outside the period, which caused him to be as low as possible - if that expression can ever be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the ward 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
It's a long way off to go, but it'll make it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple of thoughts were Williams, who had had been nervous in the morning, and he had talked a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervous system.
"I have been a tunnel this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just highlights how important this is to me, how much I and Helen, and Robin also, we have worked together.
Over the past three years with Helen and Robin, they've been great.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so he's got great thanks, and he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost their race for five years.
A couple put a rough rhythm in which their competitors did not come up with.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very closed in a moment.
He cried out "spy process, stay in process".
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we tried not to do anything special.
We were not looking for joy today, we were just trying to win a good row and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years is going to wait before deciding what his future is going to be.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he gets married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say that this would be my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland will change the current government of Panama leaks.
In October, Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which the protestors of Panama's data leaks are calling for in spring.
The so-called Panama Papers revealed that many Irish politicians have taxed around taxes and tax havens with the help of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protestors.
At that time, his successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to the analyses, it is difficult to predict how much public rage will affect the election results of the autumn.
During the June presidential elections, the criticism of the rulings was clearly visible, and the president was elected the Gudni Johannesson, who stood outside the policy.
Trump said that he was sar sarstical when he claimed that Obama was the founder founder of Iis Isis, Obama.
Donald Trump, president of the Republican President-in-Office of the United States of America, cancelled his latest convenings.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder and democratic candidate for Isisi, Hillary Clinton, who was part of the establishment of the organization.
The Democratic Party was furious about the speeches and asked for an apology from the Trump.
The commander of the army should never let anyone who could fall about that down, Clinton's reference.
In southern France, the Mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a musli-pocalypse to cover the interests of the Muslims in the bathing areas, including the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that coastal and bathing are prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and respect for seasonal swimwear.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which largely express religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder of order in France, which has been the cause of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove France to a party on the anniversary of the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extreme organizations, linked to Isa, attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu Region passed through the sile - sealing acceleration at Pyykösjär lake.
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the region of Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only on the lake of Pyykös Lake has a blue-flying seam.
During the Tuesday and mid-week period, environmental measures in the Oulu Region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other common bathing areas in the Oulu region.
Except for the sea coast, the levels of E.coli and intestinal enterococ bacteria in all bathing waters were below the operating limits laid down in the Regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
Marine bathing water E. coli and enterococous concentrations were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the limits of the action.
The blue-stamped sea basin does not yet make the water ineligible, but under favourable conditions the situation may quickly change into a blue-stamp flower, making the surface of a blue-stamped resting plant.
The environmental measures will follow the situation through enhanced inspections.
In the event of a change in the level of sealing, the information shall be provided separately on the bathing area notification form.

The MKK's Yõhärinen Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80% of forest owners outside the outside of forest owners outside the outside of forest owners are more than 80% 80% 80% more than 80% of forest owners outside the outside.
The reduction in forest gifts is one tax change in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The income tax Act proposes a tax deduction that would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the basis of the generation of forest space.
The Ministry of Finance has four objectives in the presentation of the forest fund reduction: to promote the generation of forest farms, to promote the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The hunter would reduce the net income of the forestry economy.
The idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is good, commenting on the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK) Forestry Director Juha Hakkainen.
However, it is likely that you will find a critical part of the tax reform proposal.
The reduction in the forest gift is presented as a function of the clean income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income that has been deducted from all other deductions.
The MKK and Jõhäinen considered that the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the result of the sale of wood.
The VM's proposal is to start by making a reduction in the net income of the forestry economy by preventing the loss of the income of the forestry economy, which should be deducted from other taxes.
A person would get a tax benefit, even if he doesn't have to do it.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owners are unable to visualize it, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, according to him, the model concerns only a small part of the forest owners.
The limit for the reduction in the value of forest returns is set at EUR 40 000.
It's drawn to the Yõhrainen's opinion that it's too high.
As such, according to him, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are removed from the circle of the deduction.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest management division, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing the size of the holding.
Forest policy forest gifts have been reduced by many decades according to Hajärinen.
There is a background for the ageing of the forest management and the ageing population.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful box of steel surprised drivers with Himmanga... two cars seded into a row and ran into each other and met each other and met each other.
There was a special attack on Himanga in Kalajoen on Friday morning.
According to the rescue facility, two consecutive drivings of the car closed down into a row, followed by a run ahead of us.
According to President Harri Pyyhär of the Sun-friend's firemaster, the disengagement is suspected of being led by a powerful brutality.
There were two people in the back of the car who were both transported to the hospital for medical treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car that ran above did not get hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway from 8 Himanga to a few kilometers to the Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
Recent research results from the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings from the research group conducted by Professor of Academy Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the incidence of cancer.
Many tissues, such as the chest, are very soft, and tissue cells grow in a normal way in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, growth in cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the efficacy of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells in addition to cancer cells between cells and surrounding tissue.
The results have been published on 4 August in the Native Communications Journal of Cell Biology.
The suit of family family home death is still in court, the prosecutor's prosecutor is also asking for a murder sentence for another author.
The suit of the female family death continues to be courted for both of the condemned.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June for the death of a family home with a Musketeer.
The second received 8 years 4 months from, among other things, the murder of a young person and the brutal robbery.
The second sentence is a 12-year imprisonment for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The death was also sentenced to a serious threat to road safety as a young person and to the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The prosecutor, lawyers and a man who was more strongly convicted of the judgment of the Court of Appeal appealed to the Court of Justice.
The D.A. requires a less punished man to be convicted of murder as a young person for 12 years of imprisonment.
At the time of their act they were in full understanding.
Under the sovereignty of the 17-year-old youngsters killed as director of the child care unit of the school home, working last July of last year.
The 17-year-old, who was murdered, attacked the director who was sitting on the living room couch on the grounds of the judgment.
The director had been able to get out of his grip and put a young man into his room when one of the young people hit him with a urinal tube.
Among other things, the director was strangled, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to a mental investigation, both of the condemned were fully understood at the time of their execution.
The right is that young people had planned to escape family homes at least from the day before.
The ice ice fish is the world's most long-life backbone is the most long-term vert age, and it is growing only when it is 156 or older at age age.
The world’s largest live vertebrate is a confirmed icefish, reports the research published in Science magazine.
In the northern parts of the Atlantic, like ice-cream floating around Greenland, the vault can live up to 400 years old.
The female is growing until she is 156 years old.
More than a lifetime is the fact that it only grows a centimeters a year.
Only one species is known to survive more than one ice cream.
The investigators found out age with radio communication.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residue.
Based on that, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
An older man was estimated to have been 392 years - although he was thrown in the direction or in the other direction could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump Economics - News of the People's News
Donald Trump America doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of the total tax revenues of the State would not be taxed if the change in the tax on corporate tax by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by the most profitable tax cuts.
Trump described it as a revolutionary in his tax programme during his presentation on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collecting, there would be a huge sum of $1,000 billion a year.
The excess income tax rate is now 39,6, after a reduction in the Trump rate of 33.
They'd give up all of their basic taxes.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The resulting environmental standards must be reintroduced and energy regulations removed.
The health reform of Barack Obama has to be re-readed.
The administration must be appointed "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to Trump, the "harmed" trade policy is one of the major causes of US problems.
The Free Trade Agreements would be deleted.
Imports from China would be subject to 45 % and Mexico would be subject to a 35 % penalty rate.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our belief, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America does not have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will join cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new clouds all over the country.
By contrast, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economimists, including those close to Republicans, see the Trump program leading the United States to a deep economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday, Finnish time.
An attack on the past - News of the People's News
The sea's fatally landing, but the real attack wave is hitting in the middle of Madrid's roof - the accounting can begin with the past.
That's where Pedro Almodóvar's story was all about it.
Almodovar's previous steering work Travelers (2013) was a small-scale and train-looking satirical comedy, the pre-skin skin where I live (2011) the tops of the Spanish careers of the Spaniard.
In principle, Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a suitable, seasonal love, relationship and family drama, with a mother-daughter relationship with a daughter at the heart of it.
It's a simple story and we'll see a lot of things as a long setback.
Life seems to be a model for the middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to fall apart.
A new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) in the last games of random encounters can be a miracle ever since the end of the movie.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Julieta once made life for her adult daughter.
He begins with the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
On the other hand, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, who is a TV familiar from the series Ommelte time between 2013-2014.
Julieta's ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered a cough, but I would say myself that it's rather strange and literal by unscatheding.
Almodóvar movies often have a fair distance to such a characteristic whirlwind, always with a sense of humor.
It's a flat-screened, controlled, place where there's good music, and it's a rather sad film, where it's made up of ingredients for the gesture.
On the other hand, the visual color sensitivity typical of the Spanish director is preserved and so that it begins to inject a little bit of silence into the eye in a more pure shape than a functional dramaal moderation.
Diseases, deaths, or otherwise sudden loss of life, but the surface remains one of the Koreans.
This applies in particular to the claim: in the case of a person named, the residences change from one scene to another, and the same applies to the exact earrings to be displayed.
Almodóvar is specific in these matters, but the main issue, i.e., the viruses of the current scene, is not more specific than this.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and slightly lifeless.
Almodóvar has written the script on the basis of three novels of the Canadian Canadian Alice Munro, awarded in Nobel in 2013.
Novell has been published in Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has been involved in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly balanced written literature filming.
The topics would have been an emotionally more eccentric drama, much of a great deal - especially a terrible guilt - film about the subject.
Instructions and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Major: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the movie is on August 1st, 8th.
The government is trying to hold a campaign for election - People's News News
No new cuts are being made, the cooling ministers, so that the basic Finns don't completely collapse.
In the spring, however, the surgery will be performed by a kidnapping shop.
No new surgery.
The savings of four billion have already been made sufficient.
This is how Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium.) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (kok.) under the budgetary line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, since the cuts in social security were already decided in the spring frame rule.
Child welfare, national pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pensions Index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of unemployment benefit as a result will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
Gloves, mittens and mitts
Why do ministers so much stress that there are no further cuts on these issues?
The following year shall be the calendar year.
The gymnasts are held in April and they are the most important heat meter for the parliamentary term, not the gallulators.
In the past, it has been seen that the result of the local election in various directions of the Governments has been ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallupits report that the Government Party's basic Finns expect a hive loss, although the result of the previous elections was modest 12.3 per cent compared to the elections in Parliament.
Four years ago, the primary Finns received 752 new mandates, of which the cost of influence in the rule of law is realised to a large majority in the next spring.
The course of life of the government of about three equally large parties is in case the position of the Basic Finns endures.
Now it has not endured, but more than half of the voters voted for the need for government policy during the first year.
The first characters of the parliamentary group's visits have also reached the surface.
First of all, the fact that next year, they will be carried out violently and, secondly, they will try to calm down the attack on basic Finns.
Major surgery in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different if the Sipilä government is still standing.
The Government has set the goal of reliance on debt during this parliamentary term, but next year, the proposal for the budget of Petter Orpo will take EUR 5.9 billion, more than this year.
After the settlements, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is neither able nor even slowed down.
The other one's got to stick to the program.
It will mean more severe operations on the previous one in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be a close balance during 2018 and then the spring will be adopted in Parliamentary elections as to what will happen.
With these measures, debt debt is not expected to be credited.
It is quite clear that current measures on debt do not make sense, even though Juha Sipilä how to try to relieve a positive mood.
The curves presented by the Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen at the information conference of the budget testify against it:
The growth forecasts of the global economy have repeatedly proved to be over-optimal, i.e. help from the international economy is not going to happen.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over this decade and has prolonged from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment is now costing EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
General government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-term of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt relief proposed by the Left Party was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year the maintenance of unemployment will cost approximately EUR 6 billion, which will be fully covered by a new debt.
This is the understanding of the responsibility of the Centre, the Meeting and the Basic Finns.
Question: The municipalities want to leave a lot of tasks to do.
Three out of four considers that the organisation of day care, youth work and exercise of children is the responsibility of the municipality, shows the research of the KAKS Foundation for the Development of the Kungallis sector.
A large majority of the people also assume responsibility for individual municipalities from libraries, culture, citizenship, building supervision, higher education and waste management.
The responsibility for the county is more clearly sought by the county, special medical care, vocational training, polytechnics and institution care for developing disabled people.
None of the tasks of local governments under the responsibility of order is to be transferred to the State.
A long, long-lasted railway driver ran behind and ended a chase to get the police out of the way.
A 16-year-old motorcycle driver driving a police department in Joensuu on Friday night on Friday night at half at the same time.
The police department tried to stop without a bright driving bike, but a young man left to drive the police along with fair speed.
The rear drive continued on the Sonjajan coast from which the Sorronahon road and the lower forest road where the motorcycle ran out of the way.
After this, a young man ran away, but a faster-footed cop ran off to the fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 percentages.
He also did not have a driving licence that would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
The case is examined, among other things, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was in a stone truck fell down the river.
The truck in the stone truck fell down the river on the Polvijär lake on the Kavintie road on Thursday night at 21:15 p.m. on Thursday night.

The blast flow caused massive damage to the environment, which has been poured out by the tents of the Parafest Festivals.
Arthur Pippuri, president of the Joensuu Parapolar Association, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its financial legs, and the event can be organised next year as well.
The last performer of Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will continue with presentations held at the theatre's premises from 13 a.m.
Art Centre Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition at 13-15 a.m.
The programme is planned to be planned.
The blast flow is generated in a cloud of thunder when rainwater and its weight are triggered by a falling air flow.
Changes in the weather conditions of a cloud cloud are bound by heat and therefore the decline in air mass is cooling and its speed toward the earth is rising.
The Air Science Institute reports that current currents occur in Finland several times during summertime.
It's hard to predict the route of efficiencies.
The flash flow struck the location of Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m. on the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum.
Three tents fell off, a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, there were only four people who were slightly injured by the accident.
There was one child in this group who was transported slightly injured to further treatment.
Air pollutions are ageing in the lononians.
According to the study, the skin of the lonhos grows faster than normal.
The cause of skin aging is air pollution.
The British study reports Eventing Standard.
The British skin care company Caci analysed London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many people aged two and a half years older than that of elderly people living in rural areas is two and a half years old.
The skin of the ageing small particles is a very good dust rate, which is derived from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which according to the Event Standard, are nearly 9 500 people per year die from respiratory diseases.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
Cacin's investigation found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who travel on their way to the vicinity of congested streets.
London’s residents can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example in various masks, but regular skin cleaning is recommended for a more practical solution.
Tractor's brakes failed a man standing in front of your a man standing before your head.

The U.S. was about to set up a country team for Sallibandy.
I'm excited, and here we are now, Company, 48, says.
The company was born in 1967, near New York, in the town of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki's girl when she was one year old.
In 1987, she reached the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species was not yet played on the MS level like Salibandy.
The ball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later I played hockey in Jokipoj in the SM series, I remember Jumpanen.
In 1991-92, the following three times passed through to Jobba.

Kouvola's neighborhood lit Hasu's spark of a sport and gave good lunch for a fine hobby.
There are good memories of a child.
I started the balloon when I was nine in Elimäe NMKY's E-girls.
The main point is in the sense too big a game shirt, knee protectors in the ankles, as well as great contusions and choreographers after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small local location, the sports club was a community where everyone knew each other.
The group's spirit created an environment with a nice play.
The families of all the families were very active - the father of the teammate trained us and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
The Essi Hasule beach volley was already a natural species choice to counterweight the internal flight ball during the train season.
In the 1990s, there's been a game of music on the swimming pool of our village since the 1990s.
The operation has always been active.
I also went to watch the SM event of the Juniors, thinking that one day I'd be playing there myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu is playing in the weekend together with Annina Parkkinen in the SM finals.
After Riikka Lehtkkonen and Taru Lahti, the second-ranked twin goal of the tournament is clear.
A realistic goal is for us to have a medal.
SM-cult is still missing from the prize hat, it's a mystery to throw away.
The appearance of the weekend in Kouvola may be Hasulle in front of the last known audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work are expected.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallion tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, the toes will be placed on the nail, Hasu will plan it.
The rush flow lost tents in the event of disabled people in Joensuu, the major accident was nearby.
The flash flow poured three tents on the Parafest festival for disabled people in Joensuu.
According to the newspaper Karjalainen, four people were injured in an accident.
One child was transported to a hospital for further treatment.
According to the sheep, there were about 200 people in the tents.
There was a show going on in one of the big tents.
Twelve were smaller.
The accident happened on Friday at 17 a.m.
The cardinal firefighter Markus Viitaniemi, who was interviewed by the Shepherd, tells the newspaper that there were elements in the situation of major accident.
According to Lehde, the future of the event is at stake.

Sal Solomon’s Koli of Solomon’s Koli went bravely to become a farmer of agricultural farmers.
Agriculture as an enterprise means risk mitigation, sweat and strength.
Young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in rural areas as well.
The move began shortly two years ago with his little brother, Valtter Kol, to continue working with their household.
Their father Markus Koli helps and advises brothers with his experience.
Starting as a rural operator was a debt and an increase in volume so that bread could get hand in agriculture.
It's been since I was a little boy, it's been my thing.
I've always been happy with the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything into the game.
If something starts up, I think it'll have to be serious and real.
In 2013, we went to build a driveway, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I was very bravely involved in the project, and I have been fully involved in it, the Koli of Solomon tells me and adds that it would not have been done if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good for him.
Salomon Kol's goal is to invest in even bigger nails.
The work has produced results, for Solomon Koli has been chosen as the 10 best groups in the competition of young food producers in the Rural Future magazine.
At the moment, he's competing for a possible victory.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria shall declare the inflation inflation for the first time, for the first time, for eight months of eight months for the first time for the first time for eight months for the first time for eight months for the first time for eight months for the first time to eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading of years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when a positive 0,2 % was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured in the cost of living, was -0.8 % over the last 12 months (October 2015 - July 2016) when compared to the previous 12 months (October 2014 - July 2015).
The living cost index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure time and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothes and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household supplies and routine care (0.5%), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as the previous month as for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education.
Snapchatin's "aime" effect is considered to be an Asian flock type.
According to Snapchat, the anime has been an inspiration source for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
By means of its lens tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to transform reality and to play with identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into ananaxes, dogs or characters that would suit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are simple, face-forming tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfie per day.
All misleading steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's tapes have previously been criticised for the accusation that the application advertises blackface or "black" mask or favours bleached skin color as a beauty design for beauty.
So when Snapchat advertised it this week for some users of lens that gave them the plowing eyes, the twats of teeth and the naked cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - "the yellow face" or " Yellowface".
And they wonder if these repeated non-exhaustives could be a sign of a larger company's problem in terms of diversity.
News and misfortune spread widely on Wednesday with the reports of The Vergen and Motherboard, the day later, Snapchat said that he had ceased his property.
The company offered an explanation: Linssi was meant for honor to anime characters, not to be a caricature of Asians.
But for those who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in operation.
Others denied anime comparison with arousingly.
A Korean American art student, who was widely shared in twitish photographs, said in her e-mail that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it's difficult to argue against a comparison with the most recent gross Asian caricature and filter performances".
It shows that the filter is not just yellowish, it is yellowed down to extreme contempt.
Snapchat is not the only company to cross these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to be stuck in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, corporations meeting rooms in Hollywood and equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge, racially older, diverse youth audience can mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
Katie Zhu, a 25-year-old, said in the interview on Thursday that when one of the Snapchat lenses creates an offensive image for the user, "it is much more difficult for these guys to be unnoticed."
Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer working on the Medium, decided to remove their Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and his phone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity of terms and practices for the remuneration of Snapchat.
Zhu appreciated the company's principally white male wire and decided to write a letter on the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#BestSnapchat)
"If they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colours for their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions," Zhu said the Chinese-American, "or they have representatives of different colours at work, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, the complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to reply.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, considering its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snachat refused to discuss the rotation of his staff, but according to the representative, the company hired the recruiter a while ago to focus on vulnerable populations and to advance internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for its part, said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "Is it true that they actually need more users like us to be able to say that this is not a reason."
According to the Congress panel panel in Congress panel, military officers were distorted by Isis intelligence data.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress Panel said that the authorities from the U.S. military military headquarters had modified intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war on Daddy in Iraq and Syria than the events had justified on the spot.
A report by the Republican President, the Committee on Intelligence and the Sub-Committee on Budgetary Control, established by the Committee on Defence, found a "wide dissatisfaction" among the main intelligence analysts of the House of Representatives, who said that the chairs failed their assessment of the efforts of the Americans to overcome Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the commander of the armed forces’ military operations unit in Tampa, Florida, which monitors US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The outputs of intelligence accepted by the senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the site justified. They were generally more positive than the analyses produced by other sources of intelligence", the press release said.
"Centcom events are unacceptable - in the war of our fighters, when bad analyses are presented to senior policymakers," said Ken Calvert, my Republicman from California.
The failure of Centcom's leadership is all the way up to the top of the organization.
The 10th-page report describes in detail a detailed description of the constant problems in the description of headquarters headquarters and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-ranking authorities of Obama's administration have designated reports to be obsessive, it describes the analysts' feeling that Centcom's leaders would have put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, Isisi, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and evidences of the capital building to Congress were considerably more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that the major attack on the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still in possession of Daddy.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, President of the Republic of Kansas, in the opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, high-value intelligence leaders of the US military military military headquarters's main base were manipulating the outputs of the headquarters's intelligence in order to reduce the risk of Isis's threat in Iraq.
The Republicans set up the task force after hearing that analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence in the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will follow more extensive results during the investigation.
An additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence has been initiated by the Ministry of Defence.
The members of the Committee on Parliamentary Intelligence published their own findings on Thursday, which were in agreement with the final conclusions of some of the Republican Working Party.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an intelligence assessment of Isisi and Iraq's security forces in an unbundled process," said Adam B. Schiff, the Committee's leading democraticist, in the opinion.
According to Schif, this process "longed the publication of surveys", deteriorated the mood among analysts, and "not enough space for different perspectives".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to press Centcom analysts to agree their conclusions on a "pre-set or political story".
On Tuesday, the Daily Beas will report on the preliminary results of the Congress survey.
In the last August The New York Times reported that the Pentagon supervisor has started an investigation following the complaints of Centcom's analysts.
In the opinion, Captain Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress report for as long as the investigation of the superstitious auditor is ongoing.
But he said that "experts differ between the interpretation of complex information, and the Intelligence Community and the Ministry of Defence welcome the dialogue on these essential national security issues".
There are other consequences for the investigation, such as just the question of whether US-led bombing actions in Iraq and Syria are successful (such as an increasing number of defence authorities now claim).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the headquarters to carry out an honest assessment of the war on Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises.
The criticism of the Islamic State intelligence reflects over a decade's burden on the fact that Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a study article saying that, in spite of several objections from the analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and took very little time to consider the consequences of the attack on 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion concerning intelligence in Islamic state intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, there had been no significant deterioration in the economy of the terrorist group in order to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this finding was not reported outside the capital building.
The Bridge Commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was started to criticise last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate in an superior assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and his place at headquarters became General Joseph L. Votel.
For the fourth time, the United States will win the fourth consecutive victory in women's country of agriculture, organising a mediation with the United Kingdom.
After having made three goals for the team to win Japan's 6-1, Katie Bam did on Thursday for the US Women's Country Jack team the first two goals for the Americans to win India's 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound unforgettable, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a book about his paintings."
But he knows this: Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympic tournament and they split their group first with Britain, which was still unbeatable after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the fourth quarter, and this game will decide who will be first and who will second be their six teams in their group.
First, you will avoid being a strong Dutch leader of another group at the beginning of a slightly longer quarter-finals.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, Americans have been admiringly successful here, four years after they stayed in London's Olympics for the last of 12 teams.
Bam was on the team.
He grew up in the Pink Bell of Pennsylvania and first picked up his countrykeymail when he was 3 years old (his older twins played the species in Drexel) when he was 16 years old, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because he was unable to participate in his final list of players.
In 2012, nothing went wrong with him and his teammates.
The following year the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"A change in the sun, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have a job in London like we have now.
We've done a complete translation.
On Thursday night Bam started the first half of the goal during the hovering near the paint.
India had entered into a game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the situation in 1-0 blocks until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He took the ball a long way to the left of the field, then he went around the middle of the field, and he took the ball to the finish line, taking the Americans to 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added four times in the middle of the last finish.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper for Jackie Briggs, who had released one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," said Parnham, but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
The peace of Trampoliin in the middle of the Olympics' most important summit.
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are in progress.
The events of Rio de Janeiro appear to be continuous and inevitable, fierce competition and effort to communicate.
It's as if the Olympic Olympics were a flaming loophole, passed from a bow to a swimmer and a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to put on television, read a newspaper or listen to a guest friend's conversation in a coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Closes' anger.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympic first-time and future heart-breaker with a smile lesson, could well be one of the names of all the people who are being introduced to their best viewing time, supported by sponsorship agreements and good mind TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, gymnastics or even a sword-maker.
But Dooley, 28 from California Lake Forest, competes for the Olympics in trampoliin.
The Olympics do not light all the species as much as they do.
Far beyond the center, partly in the shadow, are the species that are not generally accepted by everyone: atmospheric amber, spring ammo, balloon, taekwondo.
We've always got a bra, long enough to live it.
But if I can make a certain number of my special favors, I would like to draw attention to the deranged charm power of trampoliin.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it first played in Sydney, its presence is so low between the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize that it was the Olympic species at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has never moved to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share male, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year China Dong Dong and Canada Rosie McLennan are defending London's gold medal.
However, trampoline is associated with a certain type of subterritorial appeal, partly because an unorthodox replacement sounds more appropriate to clown school than to Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an incompetent fan.
The species has an opportunity to entertain, as is observed by the colour of the endless bombs of the drawing spheres, but also has the closure of gymnastics and swimming pools, two species which are essentially united in it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means a pushbar.
Master's followers jump with a giant trampoline up to almost 30 feet high, and they will have to perform up-to-date series of business (turns, skills and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they are assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and time of "flight".
In Rio, 32 athletes compete in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The trend of the most popular Olympics is straight ahead.
The scales of hope have to go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back round the field.
They are not only hunting the goal line or the beginning wall, but also, in the television news, the second whirling border: the world or the Olympic exhibition.
This determined pursuit is noble, admireable, and even fanatical, and it can even get a viewer to tears.
But that is also why it can be a bit exhausting to watch the races.
Trampoline provides rest for this.
Trampoli's direction is up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The contestant rises up again, with the effect of pressureless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly again up.
Of course, this does not affect competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no violent rush towards the end, no jump to the distance, only a dreamful, fused interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close as the Olympics can reach.
The women's racing contests and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at the beginning of the broadcast at 13 noon (ET), the men's races will also arrive on Saturday at 13 a.m., and the men's races will also be on Saturday at 13 a.m.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon software from 14 a.m. to 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic holocaust, they offer a quiet, charming moment that is most likely not noticeable in general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by providing male athletes for staring and objecturing (such as the American men-benders suggested some time ago according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting to be agitated by his new fanship.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, which is a long-term ally of the United States of America.
Vi violent demonstrations in Ethiopia violent protests in Ethiopia violent protests in Ethiopia.
The political change in Ethiopia has been faced with violent opposition from the government.
The viewers say that dozens of protestors have been shot to death in conflicts with the police.
Is Ethiopia broken?
Over the last decade, it has been one of the most stable African states, a strong Western ally, whose economy is growing rapidly.
However, the protests against the government over recent months have shaken the country as it spreads to more and more areas.
One last week, thousands of people rushed into the streets, demanding profound political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was pathetic.
The viewers said that the police shot and killed dozens of non-armed protesters.
The videos recorded in demonstrations, which are believed to be at the end of the last year or from the beginning of this year, show how safety officials hit young people at the same time as they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations Supreme Court of Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
"The holding of this country was always difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future", said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the African horn International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second most violent country in Africa, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
International military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country is getting so much help from the Western countries.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new train for employed persons.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not, however, been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have been constantly talking about the repression of the government, the opposition of the country has been limited, and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been banished, imprisoned, killed or driven far away from the desert.
But this could be changing.
"If you suppress people, and they have no other choice but to show their minds, this will happen" said Seyoum Teshome, university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youngster is showing his mind.
One generation shows their minds.
The complaints are diverse and cover all aspects of the jurisdiction of the coalition governing the land use.
After a lot of critical elections last year, the ruling party with its allies got the last opposition to hold, and now it holds all places in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border between Eritrea and this fierce and controversial battle along the border of the border required hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which has been more or less defeated over the past few years, may try to abuse and re-armise.
Numerous factors explain why after years of flooding, bitter feelings are about to explode.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Only over the past few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social media since cheaper smartphones have become widespread and internet services have improved.
Even if the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still send messages through hidden network brokering servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, two of the two major ethnic groups, oromos and amharas, of Ethiopia are better equipped with each other.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For a very long time, Amharas, who come from most of the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business using orphans, many of which are Muslims and who live on ales.
But it's changing, too.
"We're on our way towards the organization below one umbrella", Ormo Director Mulatu Gemechu said.
The largest demonstrations have been in the amhar and oronomic areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos think that Ethiopia is unfairly governed by the tigre people. The nation covers about 6% of the population and controls the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of problems is Meles Zenawin's loss.
Meles, former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly competent to observe early dissatisfaction signs and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"There is no such thing as that in the national government," said conflict analyst Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hallemarim Desalegn, was selected relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from North Ethiopia, Hallemamaam is south of the country.
Analysts say that security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bleeding.
For the last time, Ethiopia was under such an attack in 2005, when thousands showed their minds about the elections that according to analysts it seemed that the government first drowned and then robbed them.
In the wake of the impact attack, many protestors died, although less than in recent months, and that period of rest went by relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for a sense of infrastructure planning, such as the new business train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But, obviously, this has not stopped the inward opposition of the Ethiopian Government.
And now it's starting to get dangerous, ethnic shape.
In the last month, the protestors in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked the companies owned by the tigers, and the hatred against the tiger becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Western Unions in the position of coughing.
The American Government has used Ethiopia as a base for air-flight flights to a neighbouring country in Somalia, although it has been saying, some time ago, that it has closed down this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want to finish their unstable allies falling apart either.
"This," Abdi said, "there's real equilibrium."
Donald Trump explains his claims to be "sacress" by Obama-based Daddy-Iis-Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign having taken over a dispute on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when he was a number of times this week inspired President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be "the basis of the Islamic state terrorist group".
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American general.
It also set up his defender, who has been embroiled to defend him during a stormy period, in a difficult position where they must explain observations that he does not necessarily mean.
After the announcement of the Wednesday night campaign, Trump also increasingly argued that on Thursday's interviews, when he inspired him to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
In the early Friday morning Twitter release Trump said, however, that he was just sarcastic.
The publication was a complete copy of the previous day when Trump said in several interviews that he was really serious about the accusation.
When the conservative radio manager Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumpi decorate his remarks, reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isisi, the President of the Republic, who took this hearing in his ear.
The latest crisis of criticism comes in a situation where Trump has attempted to refocus its campaign in the midst of the economic opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought while talking about the economy this week in Michigan.
Friday Trump tried to return to the subject again.
I'm on Twitter again, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes, and he said that he was boring.
Trump has used sarcoma defense before.
Later in July, when he faced a broad criticism apparently, he suggested that the Russians hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments by saying "I guess I'm sarcastic".
The approach enables Trump to go within the limits of political speech and then return, if necessary, if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he testes certain messages that are important to his fans. He looks at how they work and then "explicate" in the direction or depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think that he's illogical about his statements and that he knows that they're vague enough to filter them through several different lenses.
Instead of reducing speech for a large referendum, Trump has been more cloudy in recent days after his popularity has continued to decline.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey showed that the Trump lay down behind Clinton significantly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump basically seeks to avoid apologizing to his words about provocative matters, he often blames his critics for misconception of his words or for misunderstanding their sense of humor.
While facing an ever closer examination of the presidential election campaign over the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to be uncomfortable in a position where they must publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most significant supporters of Trump, saw a lot of trouble defending the candidate for CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when he was asked about the reality of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton set up the Islamic state.
It is true that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, the small organization he called amateurs was completely wrong, and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops away from Iraq.
The majority of the Republicans of power are trying to argue that the Obama Government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Isisi to get worse because it failed to manage the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before the Friday meetings of Pennsylvania, Trump continued on Twitter to attack on Twitter towards the news media, which will cool off every word of him and be neutral against him.
He made fun of "creepy, pathetic" television experts who try to find out about him, saying, "They can't succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked the Trump's excuse for new evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
The former closed coffee shop will return back to Greenpoint to Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a small, just a cash acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but who offered a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the streetside of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The shop that replaced Verbin in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cane-shaped soap.
The locals were making it worse as the most recent loss in a middle-class sane city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is broken, and Verb is now soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a reinventment.
Elevated Verb opened last November to Greenpoint, under a mile from its original location.
The new Webb has a wifi and can pay credit cards, but part of the staff is still the same, and there's the same subtle atmosphere.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of a new location.
He started at Verb in 2001, and was there all the way to the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, I had many things to say.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espressocoline.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it too.
He brought new ingredients.
On the menu there are pecan eggs for cheese, and the coatings offer e.g. capers and browned onion.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the coffee shop, but there's fresh juice in it.
During nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed that he had seen a steady flow of old customers.
"Williamsburg also paid too much for many former customers," he said.
One Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was a customer like that.
Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited Verb regularly.
After she moved to Greenpoint, she walked into a coffee shop.
He says after he closed down, he gave up on coffee for a while.
"I understand that I enjoy Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered a cha cheese mixed instead of his usual ice coffee coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, visited Verb faithfully from 2003 onwards.
He used to work there and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen more than seven, regular as a clock, I went in and they were preparing a spiced bagel of butter," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said that he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today Rosenthal is still making his usual order, but sometimes because of variations, he order a spiced bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he's not wearing a grudge for a soap shop that took over the old premises.
In fact, Soap Cherie's owners offered to make Verb a special cup of coffee that would be used as a ingredient in the coffee-free coffee shop.
"I think we can still take up the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted a coffee shop.
One of these new customers turned the menu into a Polish, and Rodriguez said he was planning to put it on a stand to get his new neighbor to feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local place wants a bottle and sells a frozen coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand into the next building.
For many customers, they have enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said he was unscathed when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said he felt like he came home walking in and ordering coffee.
"I needed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Dining food for the depression of the recession.
In March 1933, shortly after coming to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office room for lunch.
President Roosevelt liked a fine Fifth Avenue meal, such as a goose-bather, and Maryland's swamp turtle soup.
On that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce, and dessert from the bonewave.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," said Jane Zigelman.
His spouse, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights is a group of food historians.
Coen's latest book, Cop Suey, told me about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told me about the life story of Lower East Side through food through his book 97 Orchard.
Their newest cooperation, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet at the supplier's dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unstamped lunch bar in Flatiron, which has been operating since the stock exchange break in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese-wine bread, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss the eating of the lamb.
"The pieces were very popular", Ziegelman said.
There were peanuts, no liver fractures, no beans.
They were made from the material and some cheap ingredient, which continued the actual material.
Imagine your cancer as much peanuts as they make up your dinner.
Coe's open.
"I'm sure it's been felt in his stomach from a leadshake," he said.
Years before the recession on American tables, especially in rural areas, it was like a eat-on-noon-salk-sat-up table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal kronered the ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a country of abundance.
"The food came from a central, disturbing subject to the Americans", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same worrying was a new, affordable diet: from mysteric foods, such as those that are concerned and in boxes, became the main food, and the box was "a powerful way to use the food stars", mentioned Ziegelman, as the chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under a creamy boxing layer.
The fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
The meat, which had been at the centre of American meals for years, became a sustainablely administered luxury product.
Special ingredients were tested in terms of calorie volume and nutritional content more important than taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
During the course of the study, also for the book containing recipes, Ziegelman prepared an era of food in which roasted onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to a dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified: "It was unreal."
There's no way that peanut butter is suitable for baked cigars.
This was characteristic of a number of household receptacles.
In 1923-1943, household experts, such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Home Affairs, directed the country's way of eating more than ever before or after.
Public recipes and articles in newspapers and journals encouraged women to become "burdies" and to meet the challenge of turning into a non-preserved spaget and carrot-like festivities into delicious doses.
A Square Meal is a historic taste party.
Specially delicious are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, let me eat your cake gun.
At the same time as he publicly praised his childhood for a simple, Iowa country food, he ate like a sophisticated millionaire who had become him.
"He liked manneric food, like a fish with a throat sauce," Coe said.
He almost had a cute dining room with a tuxedo on his head.
He was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example on his own stomach.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "not only offered food that belonged to Washington's most beautiful, but also food that is also the worst."
A large number of herds were abandoned as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Our constant focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they gained a better understanding of the way in which Ziegelman's mother was eating, for example how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even sicked people."
There was an incident in the windfall.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the desserts that they had prepared at home: the bakery food which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a mutilation", Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give a name that appeared to modest receptors.
There was no cream wax in the food after that, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone drowned their spoons unintentionally into a sticky, brown Listor.
I'm surprised it wasn't bad.
Coe danced once and for all.
Sounds like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "There'd be a lot of help for a bunch of mocked-up German peanuts."
Gilead will be replaced by lawyers' expenses in the fight against Merck in the fight against hepatitis C patent against hepatitis C.
The United States Confederal Court has ordered Gilead Sciences Inc to be entitled to the costs of the lawyer against Merck & Co Inc, a doctor in a dispute with Merck & Co Inc about hepatitis C.
In June, Gilead was released from the charges of $ 200 million after they broke two Merckin patents that were involved in Gilead's success medicines to Sovald and Harvon. This was released from the time the US judge found Merck's abuses involving false oaths and other unfair practices.
In the judgment of Thursday, the United States Confederal Judge, Beth Labson Freeman, said that Gilead is entitled to be exempted from the compensations which it suffered in opposition to the application.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, who controls the market for the new hepatitis C generation, which can clearly improve more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case will be based on the year 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other for the active substance in Gilead medicines sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir, which is the basis of the laboratory work.
The U.S. support troops say that they have completely taken over Manbij, the manbij of Isian rule.
The troops supported by the United States have taken all over the northern town of Manbij, near the Turkish border, since the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now investigating the city after the last team of fighters hiding in the city left it.
The troops had released more than 2,000 wing hostages who were considered prisoners by the fighters, from Sharfan Darwin SDF, Manbij of the Military Council, told Reuters about Reuters.
"The dream is now fully under our control, but we have started investigating it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent of federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax return, which showed that the income of the presidential candidate and his/her spouses in that year was $10.75 million, and that their real federal tax rate was 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton made nearly $3.3 million in spokesperson compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he received 3 million from publisher Simon & Schuster in his letter about his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The Vice-President of Clinton, Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, published 10 years' tax returns with his wife, Anne Holton.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
" Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine set the standard for financial transparency", Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier said in the opinion.
As a harsh contrast to this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
In the same way, the U.S. presidents publish their tax returns, even if the law does not impose an obligation on them.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have been suing the tax administration for the audit of their accounts as a reason for refusing to publish tax returns.
"Your turn," Ian Sams said on Twitter by Clinton's campaign assistant when he published a link to the tax returns of the democratic candidate.
On Thursday Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the audit is completed.
The Trump critics, including the presidential candidate for the 2012 Republican Republican Mitt Romeney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his contributions to charity, his business and numerous other links, for example, to Russia.
Clinton is infected with the problem by a web video published on Friday, bringing out visible Republicans who are calling for Trump to publish its taxes.
On Thursday he raised the problem in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for the last decade has done: published his tax returns," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in two of the 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times Business Commissioner borrowed a number of tax agents and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a regulation named after a billionaire investor according to Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than one million dollars per year earn at least 30% of the taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska on Omaha last week, the Buffett, which is located in Berkhire Hathaway, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said that he was also under the control of the tax administration, and that Trump is not a "fear" tax collection agency, but a voter.
The Clinton campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax rate of the Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined rate was about 40,5 per cent.
Clinton's tax return from 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main objective was a cheap, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton announced a dividends and interest income of $100,000.

Chil powder condoms and shrubs make Tanzania's elephant protection more effective.
Naturalists in Tanzania are using an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking into human domains - they throw animals with chili powder-filled condoms.
The Keino has proved to be effective, and the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, which has been developed several years ago, together with the American Nature Conservancy, has improved its promotion by training volunteers in the North of Denmark to use an unviolable four-step way to protect homes and hundreds of people without getting hurt.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's normal day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"From the time we developed... tools, we have found a change of attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them", says Jamian Bell, Executive Director of Honeyguide, in the opinion.
The first two steps are contained in a pocket lamp for showing an intrusive elephant and playing the horn.
If it does not stop an animal, then throw away what is called a chili cloud.
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and soil and with a condenser, and then the condom is turned in such a way that only the ignition thread remains visible.
When the condom is lit, it will break the dam and crush the chili powder into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last tool is a trigger that shoots a Roman candle in the air.
RT RT paper request request for Arab requests from the Arab request of the Arab request for an Israeli reference number.
A French, Jewish-based filmmaker allowed him to conquer the media storm after he revealed that the Kmpinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's direction number. According to the worker, this is due to the Arabic "requests".
Claude Lanzmann made a film about the holocaust story about Claude Lanzmann's frustration in writing an open letter in the German FAZ release of the Berlin Kempinski Bristol Hotel.
During his recent overnight stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel's hotel in the country's destination list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be possible that in 2016 in Berlin, in the new German capital, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kampinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
In the search for an explanation, the filmmaker spoke about it at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer from there was "tired him".
The hotel recipeist said it was a well-informed decision of the management of the Hotel Kempinski Hotel.
The underlying cause of the decision was even more aggravation in the filmmaker.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli direction number," says the worker, according to Lanzmann.
German German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handesman calls the case a "great injustice", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reported.
"We were terrified and shocked by the case.
It's already a big mistake in itself.
But even more shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain in question.
This doesn't need any explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident caused quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claim that the Kempinski Hotel simply "gets up" to the alleged demands of the Arabs.
"Go," said the second publication, which noted that a hotel on the beautiful Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself challenged all the charges quickly and called it "unsatisfied" and "I apologize" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reporting.
"Religious command not to include Israel in the speed dialling list ever done", says the representative of Kempinsk, according to Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the trend number has now been added.
Police police were using tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who showed their minds against Brazilian students who had their minds against their Brazilian students.
The students contacted the police in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, when the students met to show their views on the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protestors.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break down a group of students, which led to police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express horror about the plans.
According to Paulo Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, less than 100 public schools would be closed, and 300 000 pupils would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the protests were seen writing graphics against provisional President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protestors launched as a group to support the arrest of President Dilil Roussef in the vote of the Senate of the country on his job charges.
RT RT RT RT industry: Russian- Iran trade suddenly rises by 71 %
Following the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent from the previous year, reports Russia's Ambassador Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were removed, Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in transactions in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are continuing their existing links to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Accordingly to Iran's bilateral cooperation, one of the main objectives is to expand trade", said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the total of USD 856 million for the same period in 2015 during the same period.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran increased by 91.5% to a total of 697 million dollars.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
"The growth of the well was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
In addition, Dzhagayan is expecting a record this year of Iranian tourists to Russia.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representation in Iran issued approximately 35 000 visas for Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It is also safe to say that last year's record of Iranian protesters in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd. They have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Skotti Callum Skinner hit the goal when the British caught a biker.
Scotland Callum Skinner praised the honor of the men on a team star Rio’s cycling stadium last night, when the British team’s team team’s triple defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was the anchorage in the role in which his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy was restored, the legend was proud of the young man when he made the goal of painting the victory by a presumptuous team in New Zealand.
Britain took shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won his fifth six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after laying down modestly in the sixth March race of World Championships in London, even though Hoy has then decided his race.
The problem between the competitions in Beijing and London was the replacement of Special Envoy Jamie Staff.
This was done just as soon as the Price showed up.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Momdi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man from which the British coach was holding the potential of the Scot that has now been understood.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago, and Skinner made the Olympic show in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British threesome won a duel for gold.
And after his own round, he was very much behind, but Kenny did the team's lead, and Skinner stuck to it.
The change was a large part of the transformation, and it included the Hindes drive in a larger gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to stick to the paces.
Hoy followed his position as an expert on BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hines when they entered the award interest rate.
A 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, "Welcome is flattered."
I'm just here to do my best to make a reputation.
At the final we played the Olympics and won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There can be no better way to win.
After winning London in 2012, alongside Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen off the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overwhelming victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like being in London when there were so many British flags on the foot."
As a team, we found a connection within the last three months.
We have lost so many world-stars, so winning the Olympic Games again is simply wonderful.
One event, one gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten cycling species in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we are expected to have a successful five-day cycling stadium.
Based on Kenny's condition, it is not impossible at all to imagine him repeating Hoy's novelty, the winning of three Olympic Games in the Olympic Games.
That would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that is, apparently on a holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - would raise the total of medals to six gold and one silver.
It would be the same as Hoyle.
Kenny's next race in a sprint that starts today and takes three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just wanted to enjoy one of these.
The team race is always the best.
We'll win it together with our friends.
To win alone is, frankly, lonely."
He said, "If he wins the other two gold medals, he should be given the value of the knight."
This was the only medal event of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four-legged four-legged four-mile-a-day team-a-time.
Their time was 3:51:943.
In London in 2012, the winning world record for gold is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be at the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges last night before the times when the officials called him for a length measurement.
In the same race for women, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milgavi Katie Archibald went forward at the time of the world show at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its awesome bike team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve the full range of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before Rio's races.
The background has been a drama, the least of which has not been the end of the race between the technical director, Shane Sutton, and the sex and temptation charges in April, as well as the fact that the majors, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, have not ended the race.
On the basis of the first night’s competitions on cycling stadium, it seems, however, that the now legendary reputation of the United Kingdom at the perfect moment could once again be true.
The future future future future of Portland's fuse because of the cut-off of the electricity contract in question, because of the fact that the electricity contract was being cut in question, the future future future of the Portland's fuse, in the event
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminium alloy, as well as hundreds of workers' jobs, is uncertain when the electric power company that distributed the plant revealed that one of the owners of the plant is in the process of concluding a distribution contract, so the operation of all distribution contracts is expected.
The measure follows the decision taken by Victoria's administration earlier this year that the necessary support for the operation of the plant will not be extended.
The aid amount for the 20 year period will expire in November.
Even 2,000 jobs may be threatened at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Even 2,000 jobs may be threatened, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
Moreover, the snowball effect may be possible, as the melting plant uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, which led last year to the closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The meltdown of Alcoan Portland loses money and is under the threat of closure.
The measure now follows the speculation of the future of the factory, which began as a result of a strong Australian dollar, which has recently been the result of the production price of the plant.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium alloy from the power of Loy Yang An, Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to conclude their contract.
Most of the factory owns the Alcoa and Alumina group, and the Chinese CITIC as well as the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the operation of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the physical electricity demand of the fuse will continue", said it.
According to the AGL, the agreements are the so-called 'Prolegation Agreements', which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have 12 months of notice, so they will actually end in 2017.
"For this reason, AGL expects the contracts to generate the income for the financial year 2017", said the electrical company.
All possible results to AGL from the financial year 2018 are currently limited by strong prospects for the futures of electricity wholesale prices.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by $187 million.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "will not affect Alcoan ... the ability to keep the fuse running or to secure the fuse power supply".
The US company said that it entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement had to enter into force in November of this year, but it has not yet explained why the agreement was withdrawn.
Analysts have been equipped both with the Portland fuse in Victoria, and also because of possible closure of the factory near Newcastle, Tomago, which is close to Newcastle, as the economic situation in the sector is poor.
In the past week, Stephen Mikkelsen, CEO of AGL, told analysts that Portland is using approximately 600 megawatt electricity and that Tomago is around 900 megawattts per year.
"If both factories are off the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electric] markets.
As an electricity producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, it's not just the true TV star of the Cardashians, it's on the cover of the September Vogue in September.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-mother-manger Kris Kardashian-Jenner clan's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, a brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and modelled on Milan, Paris and New York fashions, reported the news on Thursday's Instagram account.
"The viewing of this deck in a room full of loved people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
It was a unique (or perhaps only for the Kardashian style?) scripted reality video, with the entire Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding in problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and with all favorite entertainment, Keing Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about her sister's cover, but which ended up in a classic version: they were planning a surprise party.
It is a cliché of almost every children's television series (Seacrest says the words "You didn't think we'd forget about you" in the belief of a morning-baked pussy) but Kriss had to get his other girl some way to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have certainly moved to the new Kardashian era with the September Vogue location.
Kendall's great sister Kim may have received Vogue's complaint first (i.e. shared with his husband, Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is its own class.
The Vogue September number is the most sold edition of the entire year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee protocol than a fashion paper, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that from the 832 page of last year 615 there was advertising content).
Its cover is expected to be revealed so much that for the last two years the pictures of the magazine have leaked before the official publication.
Among other things, previous women on the deck have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has indeed been more of "publics that act as models" than "models that are famous".
Oscar and Dior's Ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on deck in 2013, after Lady Gaga's honorary post.
But if it happened that Jenner, which the magazine describes as "the model of success" for his generation, would hit the first category, he's quite good with the company.
These celebrities are not family or real stars of people, or young people today who are able to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has been with Lemonade's publication for one of the strongest years of his career.
Of course, not everyone is pleased about Jenner's success.
His true-tv history with Jenner's status in the fashion world will always be a pain.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and this colleague, Gigi Hadidia, calling them "this moment a morning".
This feeling rose again with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But in dissatisfaction, it's not relevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a super model in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder's makeup victory.
He and all his sisters will sell you pictures of themselves in their applications that are found behind the depository.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who she took to the LOUVE magazine.
And at his leisure time, perhaps just to see his sister Kourtney and her children, he's a real TV star.
Every year, Community legal centres turn 160 000 people away 160 000 people every year.
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable peoples will be turned away annually from the legal centres of the Community, when the sector prepares for the impact of further cuts in funding on its already over-exploited operations.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance to fight unfair decisions and against equivalents - are already being turned away in their search for legal advice and representation.
Legal services already allocated to the Community's borders are prepared for further cuts.
In June of next year, these legal centres are due to lose 30% of their federal funding.
James Farrell, the director of the legal centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not withdrawn, the situation would only get worse.
"The legal centres of the Queensland Community are chronicly under-funded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrolled and corrupt debts, families in housing, unfairly separated workers - all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable citizens in Queensland are forced to navigation complex legal problems in the midst of legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice, along with Senator George Brandi of Queensland, to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the necessary legal help in their legal problems.
Last year, the Government of the State committed its promise to increase funding for legal aid to the national average level.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Legal Centre and their customer communities, and the Government of Palaszczu will have to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was brought to trial after the employee was alleged to be at gun gunpoint.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was brought to justice that they claimed that they did nothing after they were told that the head of the North Carolina campaign threatened workers with guns in February when they were driving in Jeep.
The incident was described in the complaint raised by Vincent Bordin on Wednesday in Charlotte, the State Court of Justice of the State.
Bordin said that he expected for months that the situation would be dealt with internally before he realized that "this would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "he took out the pistol, put his right finger on the trigger, and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap", Bordini said in the action.
After the election of the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had similar experience with Phillip, the complaint was made.
"You don't have to fire things to cause damage," Bordini said in the action.
The challenge will only come two days after the presidential candidate of the Republican gave his anger when he told the public in North Carolina that "the people of the second increase", which is usually understood by the owners and gunmen of weapons, could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and would be elected by judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media has taken his word off the context and that he is not in favour of violence.
The Bord's challenge is to seek compensation from the campaign for reckless controls, as well as from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional assault.
The Trump representative, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the response request.
The efforts to reach Phillip were not successful.
WCCB, a local newsletter company in Charlote reports Phillip's recently left the campaign.
His call to Innovative Consulting Services was not immediately answered.
The campaign of Donald Trump, President of the Republic, has been controversial.
The trial is Bordin v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow brings recovery and flowering all over the stomach, not just to local communities and all over London.
For me, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of the London 2012 competitions when we saw a huge effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympics have brought huge benefits to Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, 10,000 new trainees and 40 000 new jobs will be created, and youth unemployment will be removed from the airport.
As before London’s 2012 competitions, some will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the competitions and that we would be ashamed before the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
We always have to overcome the obstacles, but Heathrow answers every question he asks.
Like the Olympics, including Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion billion jobs, as well as leave the heritage of skills and employment around both the airport and around the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has carried out a 11 billionth quarter infrastructure investment programme in time and in the budget while remaining: from the T5, which has been voted for the world's best airport terminal in five consecutive years to the T2, which was built between the two fastest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to implement the third runway, supported by 16 billion. to raise private money.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow is also a success for the United Kingdom.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment, from which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games to prevent advertising promotions from being blocked by Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games
For companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to pass the advertising barriers program are "kiss and mouse games", said one of the companies producing such a program.
Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from using their computer websites, Adblock Plus published a blog library saying that users can update software filters to prevent advertising on social networking pages again.
On Tuesday Facebook said that the code of its website will be changed from ads to make it harder for advertising inhibitors to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
But now Adblock says it's turned a new code around it.
In the book Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-up fight between the community that inhibits open source advertisements and its translators has been ongoing since the prevention of advertising was invented", and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong indication of the great tragedy that advertising inhibitors have become an industrialist.
Around 200 million worldwide use advertising inhibitors, reported last year's Pagefair and Adobe research. This is almost fourfold the amount that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenue.
However, the company is after advertising inhibitors of websites used on the computer, as mobile advertising inhibitors do not operate on Facebook mobile applications for social networking or Instagram, said the representative.
Computer advertising continues to generate enough income to make Facebook view this kind of action as worth investing.
On Tuesday, too, Facebook said that it would update its "imagination of advertising" tool to give people more power about how advertising is assigned to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that the new Adblock filters were worrying, as they would also prevent part of the site from being a advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to tackle the problem", said the Facebook representative in the e-mail statement.
Maintensive inhibitors are boring tools, which is why instead we are focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that provide control for people.
The woman got hit by a car on a Swiss motorway road, apparently because of suicide, she got hit by a woman because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after the woman on the freeway was left under several means of transport on Thursday at an early hour, which apparently was suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road just after midnight on Thursday, near Morges Vaudi.
The woman did a "unfortunate work" and settled in the dark on the road where she was hit with several vehicles, the Vaudin police said in the opinion.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene of the event.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed, but not all have yet been identified, told the police who appeals to them and to all witnesses who have witnessed the incident to report to them.
The crime investigation has started, which is a "logical" step in this situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genevelle.
"But let me see if any of the involved drivers can be charged with the charges.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
"Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not considered responsible.
In both cases, where there was a person walking on a dark highway, it was estimated that drivers cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, they said in the newspaper.
Last year, the police were released on charges of non-compliance after he was hit and killed by a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had fallen off the road, told the court.
The Court found that the police, which was responding to the emergency call, pursued in a reasonable manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday's case near Morges should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 02 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once resident.
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus was probably once resident.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether the moon, watertight surfaces and the filling of CO2 with air development could sometimes have been ground-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that Venus's slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Brother could have been a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it could still be run slowly.
The model also looked at early Venus’s surface formation.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet, but there were once enough water and geographical variations to enable life and quickly protect water from loss of water.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30 per cent of the dimmer sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus's slow rotation reveals its half-day sun for almost two months at a time", GISS’s researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the newsletter.
This warms up the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer, which acts as if it were a umbrella for protection from the surface of large parts of the solar heat.
As a result, the average global temperatures are actually a few degrees lower than the current Earth's temperatures.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus, similar to what planet researchers had previously assumed before.
Although Venus was likely to be inhabited at times, it was exposed to excessive heat and UV light over several billion years.
The oceans of its oceans disappeared and its water vapours burned in the UV light.
When its hydrogen ran away, the only left is a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere with deadly greenhouse gases - Venus, which we now know.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gave up his coach's nest of Avalanche's nest.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the activities of the Vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche coach and Vice-President of the Arctic, i.e. due to the lack of scope in the decision-making process of the team.
The Vice-Chairman of Colorado/Sakic, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and noted that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have made my duty as Vice-President of Colorado Avalanche, and head coach of ice-cream affairs with enthusiasm, passion and determination", a 50-year-old Roy said in the opinion.
I've been thinking over the summer for a long time and carefully about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the views of the Vice-President of coach and hockey should be fully consistent with the attitude of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not being implemented.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision", Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was appointed the winner of the Jack Adams Award award to the best coach of the league during the first Avalanche season in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the central division to win, but in the first round of Colorado landing games, the team has not been able to make any progress in the last two years.
The Avalanchen games during 2015-16 ended 39 wins, 39 defeats and 4 draws, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the Western Conference's wild card drop point.
Hall of Fame selected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups - two in both Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
The oil workers in the North Sea continue to negotiate and delay the strike.
The work struggles of North Sea oil workers due to pay are suspended when all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The lakes of the oilfield service company Wood Group have been organised at random by the North Sea drilling cars led by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as Unit and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to reintroduce a process to resolve the current dispute", read the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will hold a number of full-day meetings from the earliest next week, so that we can take problems with the recent review.
According to the professional associations, their recent work struggles, which they claim to be the first to exceed 25 years, were a objection to possible, up to 30% pay cuts.
This year, the Wood Group cut the premium for North Sea contractors by around 9 per cent due to the negative market pressure.
The remuneration reduction of the company will result in a 10% reduction for contractors in its respective countries from 2014 to 2014.
The company said that further cuts would provide the company with the necessary space to find out about the slowdown in the market.
In turn, Shell has reduced thousands of people from their pay lists and announced its plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company will reduce its operations as a result of its giant fusion with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of lower oil prices, and this economic situation is worsening the UK's June decision to leave the European Union.
In the past week, Mr Dave Anderson, a member of the Scottish Parliament, met the co-legislators to discuss one generation of the largest labour disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential for the region's economy.
"We need a economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the opinion.
The North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects in 2016, whereas the average over the previous five years has been about USD 7 billion.
Kepler will measure the rate of rotation of the stars in the Plejades star range.
The latest Kepler Open Tower mission has helped astronomers to collect the fullest listing of the speeds of the stars of the Plejades Star.
The new data will help astronomers to understand why the stars of a number of stars spin at varying speeds, and how circulation times relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we now learn more about the relationship between mass mass, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luis Rebull, research researcher Luis Rebull, the researcher at the Pasadena Center at Caltech infra-red processing and analysis of Caltech's infrared processing and analysis of Pasadena's researcher Luisa Rebull said in the press release.
The star capital of the Plejades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
A number of stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching an adult age.
They're running at the top of the line now.
At its peak, these adult stars are rushing large amounts of stars from the stars.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the stars grow older, its speed is slowing down.
Kepler will measure the speed of rotation of each star by monitoring the appearance of identifiable star spots, such as solar clouds.
The list of latest stars speeds suggests that the more massive stars are going to run more slowly than the less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, of which larger make pies slower than smaller ones.
In the "Blejads", we see that the slowest bikers are usually more massive, whereas the fastest bikers are usually very light stars", Rebull said.
As the number of Plejades is so close, it is ideal for the cosmic laboratory's star properties to be evaluated by rotational speeds.
"The group of stars provides an anchor to spin stars on theoretical models that understand both directions, younger and older", Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, because and why stars slow down their rotational speed and say they're hanging on their dancing shoes.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of the speeds of Plejadi in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
