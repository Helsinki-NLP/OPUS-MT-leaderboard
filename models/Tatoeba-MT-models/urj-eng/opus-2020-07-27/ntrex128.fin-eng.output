The members of the Wales delegation are afraid that they seem to be stupid fools when they look like fools to fool fool by the Wales representatives of Wales's representatives.
Some Members of the Assembly have become confused by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP, the Member of Wales (Man of the Welcome Parliament).
It was the beginning of the plan to turn the name of the delegation into a parliament for Wales.
Members of the Parliament are concerned, irrespective of their nationality, that the change may lead to mocking them.
According to one of the Labour Party representatives, the group is concerned that the name "mortal with the words Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means cocoa.
According to a representative of the Labour Party, a majority of the group "are not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a conservative party's representative, his group looks at the name change "open mind", but points out that the MWP word is a simple word for a stupid word.
In Wales, the w-book is described in this context in the same way as the U-book of Yorkshire.
The Commission, which is preparing the legislative amendment required for change, stated the following: "The final decision on the titles of the members of the delegation, of course, belongs to the members themselves."
The Law on the Administration of Wales for 2017 gives the delegation the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on the proposals that the appointment of a delegation to the Wales Parliament enjoyed broad support.
The Commission prefers Members of the Assembly as members of the Wales Parliament or discounts to WMP, but the MWP option received the highest amount of support from the public opinion.
The members of the committee are apparently proposing alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may lead to a major consensus on President Elin Jones, who is expected to have amended the bill within a few weeks.
The legislation on amendments also contains other changes to the functioning of the delegation, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the form of the comitology system.
In the course of the legislative reading, the members of the committee may give their final vote on the title to which they should be invited.
The Macedonians are going to the elections in the referendum on changing the name of the country's name.
On Sunday, the voters will vote whether the name of the country will be changed to "North Republic of Macedonia".
The aim of the referendum is to resolve decades of dispute with the neighbouring Greece, which also has its own country called Macedonia.
Athens has long been repeating that the name of the northern neighbours is, in practice, a regional requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its efforts to join the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia against the referendum, Gjorge Ivanov, has said that he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of referendums such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that the name change is simply the price of EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martins silence when the churches of Harlem live difficult times.
"The older people I've been discussing with say that before each street there was a bar or a church," says Adams.
"There's neither."
He said that losing bars is understandable.
He said, "The human interaction has changed.
"The bars are no longer in the neighborhood's common living rooms, to which people gather regularly."
In the case of the churches, he is concerned that the sale of property does not carry as far as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to their departure grid."
He added that churches can be replaced with dwellings and apartments that lively people are not the ones that supported the temples remaining behind the neighbourhood.
"Absolutely more people who buy housing from these buildings will be white people," he says, "and so they will spend the day when these churches will close their doors permanently, as it is unlikely that most people who move into these rooms would become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by the white-haired churches before Harlem became a black-hove residential area - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a century later.
In the 1930s, the original White Methodist Church moved out of the 1930s.
A nearby black - women congregation acquired a building at its disposal.
St Martins took over the Black Church under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotts against the traders of 125th Street's main commercial street in Harlem, in opposition to the remuneration or promotion of black men.
In 1939 the fire was badly damaged by the building. When Father Johnson’s parishes planned for reconstruction, they introduced a tower column.
Pastor David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martins, proudly called the towering game "the watch of poverty."
The expert who called the Tower game in July called it the "cultural heritage" and "unreplaced as a historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first tournament game played by a black musician. It was a Dionisio A. Lind who changed to play a larger torking game for Riverside 18 years ago.
According to Merriweather, St. Martins didn't replace him.
In St. Martins over the past few months, there has been a complex gap involving architects and contractors hired by the church’s farmers and, on the one hand, by the episcopal ski campaign.
In July, an administrative body composed of the local governors of the congregation wrote to the ski community about the fact that the ski crew would "switch the costs" to the sawmill, even though it had not been involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the ski crew.
Some congregations complained about lack of transparency with regard to the hiicaps.
The shark damaged a 13-year-old huffer in California.
Officials tell the shark that he attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him when he dived lobsters on the opening day of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas just before seven in the morning.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had dived with his friends on Saturday morning about a half an hour when he heard the boy scream for help. He and the others were talking to him to help him out of this water.
Hammel said first that he thought he was only excited when he caught a lobster, but then he realized he was screaming, "I was bitten!"
I was bitten!
When he arrived at the boy, Hammel says he found out that this entire soul had been torn open.
"I've been able to get everyone out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, which is said to be critical of his condition.
The type of shark attacked is unknown.
At the media conference, Captain Larry Giles said that there had been a shark in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was said to be a harmless species.
Giles added the victim's severe injuries to his upper body count.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablanca Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's will be going to the United Kingdom Beauty Beauty Care Authority of the United Kingdom.
Sainsbury's interviews Boots, Superdrugin and Debenhams' stores in beauty care departments that serve expert advice.
This is a major movement for a beauty care company worth 2.8 billion dollars in the United Kingdom, which will continue to grow even though sales of fashion and household goods will decrease. Larger beauty care departments will be experimented with 11 shops across the world and will be extended to other shops next year.
The beauty care products are placed because supermarkets are trying to fill the shelf space that was previously reserved for television, microwaves and household goods.
Saksbury's tells us that the range of beauty care products doubles in 3 000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Orea, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and receive their own brand-specific territory in the same way as Boots stores.
A supermarket will also re-install its Boutique mix. In the future, the majority of products will be vegan-friendly because young shoppers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop has been experimenting with rental stores in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second is opened at Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Internet purchases and the changeover of food purchases to small singles in nearby stores force supermarkets to come up with new appeals for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look even more like stores when the supermarket chain is fighting cheap shops like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and non-food products.
After buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened up hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, and also Habit stores. The company tells us this has contributed to the sale of food and made the purchases profitable.
Supermarket failed in its previous attempt to renew beauty care and pharmacy.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended with a dispute about how the yields of supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy will be followed by a business transaction in which Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to Celesio, which owned Lloyds Pharmacy, a total of 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company said Lloyds was part of a plan to expand the range of four stores to a large range of skin care products, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
The commercial director of Sainsbury's, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty care department to improve customer experience.
We have also invested in highly trained workers who are ready to advise customers.
Our range corresponds to all needs and attractive environments as well as our convenient location, we make us a convincing place to shop for beauty management, which challenges the traditional way of shopping."
And Peter Jones "slap" Holly Willoughby retired after a $11 million contract contract was concluded with Holly Willoughby on a contract of 11 million pounds in a contract.
The Dragons Den Star Peter Jones left with his "flying" when TV driver Holly Willoughby retired 11 million pounds of an agreement with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home supplies and housing label for Truly.
The twin company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop's brand.
The 37-year-old planner of This Morning announced that he was leaving on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's star, Peter Jones, was able to withdraw from their productive lifestyle business in recent moments, and he is now planning to focus on his new jackpots with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell me that Jones was "happy" last Tuesday at an intense meeting held in Marlow, Buckinhamshir, the head office of Jones' business empire. The star girl had admitted that her new 1.5 million pounds of contracts would not leave enough time for their home supplies and housing label to Truly.
The company has been compared with the Gwyneth Paltrowin Goop brand, and it was considered to double Willoughby's estimated 11 million assets.
According to the 37-year-old Willoughby, on Instagram, he left Truly, Jones flew from Britain one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, "Truly was obviously Holly's most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His decision of departure has left everything in the power of surprise.
No one could believe Tuesday events so close to publication.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of expected products for sale.
This Morning is one of the most secure stars in Britain, and according to experts, his departure can cause millions of losses to the company due to product investments, which include all the pillows and clothing for household appliances, not to mention the delay in publication.
It could mean the end of long friendship.
The mother of three children Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby arranged Cappin Truly in 2016 and a 52-year-old Jones presiding in March.
Couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% share of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby's the new brand ambassador for M&S and he's replacing Ant McPartlin's ITV as a driver for I'm A Celebrity.
The source near Jonesia said last night, "We did not comment on his business".
And then we fell in love and fell in love.
He was joking about the criticism that he would receive on the media from his comments which some would consider inappropriate to the President, as well as his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much to you?
Trump said he was pretending to be the voice of the newsman.
"I didn't give up any."
He pointed out Kim was interested in seeing again after Trump's first meeting of July as a significant step towards the nuclear nuclear concentration in North Korea.
However, the nuclear negotiations have failed.
Following the Singapore Summit of more than three months in July, North Korea’s top-level diplomat Ri Yong Ho reported to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North is not seeing the United States’ "responsible reaction" to the early arms-responsibility activities in North Korea.
Instead, he stated that the United States would continue its sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his speech, the drum had a much more optimistic point of view.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results. The missile tests have been completed, hostages have been released and the remains of American soldiers have been returned home.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to get out of there 10 000 more, we would have about 200 people standing right there", Trump said, showing the audience right ahead.
The tsunami and earthquake of Indonesia destroyed an island, hundreds dead, hundreds dead, and hundreds dead.
For example, several foreign voluntary organisations were informed that there was no need for them in the latter years of the Loboki earthquake.
The national emergency facility required for international assistance was not declared to be an emergency, although about 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok had remained homeless.
"In many cases they have, unfortunately, made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging," said Summung.
Although Save the Children form a group traveling to the Palace, it is not certain whether or not a foreign staff can work on the field.
Sutopo, the National Disaster Agency’s editor, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the Please situation to see whether international organisations were allowed to participate in the assistance work.
Indonesia is still unfortunately unprepared to face natural forces, taking into account frequent earthquakes.
Although Acehi has been built on tsunami shelters, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The request was likely to be lost because of the missing tsunami warning syndrome, although the warning was in force.
Traveling between the numerous Indonesian islands is challenging even under the best conditions.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
The hospital ship assigned to assist the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Pala, but it will take at least three days before reaching a new accident zone.
President Joko Widodo made his election campaign in Indonesia to focus on the development of spent infrastructure, and he has promised to make money for the improvement of roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit has been hampered by management, while the new elections will be approaching next year.
A number of pressures also increase the tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where Muslimism in the country has adopted a more ancient form of religion.
Christians and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with jungle boats, bows and arrows, and other initial weapons. This has resulted in more than 1,000 people dying and tens of thousands have been forced to leave their homes.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge santteged a late payback against Chelsea.
On Saturday Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool's defeat from the elections after painting 89 minutes at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was fed from Xherdan Shaqir 27 from Chelsea's goal when his team was at the finish position.
He moved the ball to the left before he drowned a shot towards the back of the back seat.
The shot was floating high over the penalty zone towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball was dropped over the kepa Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to make myself play in order to get the ball and Shaq played as much as possible, so I was just trying to create myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching, I took one touch and fired without thinking too much."
Chelsea led the match in mid-term, after the painting of Eden Merid in Belgium, on 25th minutes.
In the situation, the Blues sprain gave Mateo Kovacic a back-up, before he walked away near the middle field and snuck into the inner half of Liverpool.
Kovac played a quick wall kitchen in the middle field.
Then he released Eduardo to the penalty area with a great blatant feed.
The hare ran away from defense and skipped Liverpool Alison Becker's left leg in the back corner with a left foot shot.
Liverpool meets the champion's league in mid-term at Napol, Italy, on Wednesday at 15 a.m. on the San Paolo stadium.

The number of victims of the death of Indonesia tsunami is rising to 832 deaths.
Early Sunday, the Indonesian Disaster Agency reported the number of earthquakes and tsunami deaths to 832 victims.
Sutopo Purwo told me at the press conference that many had been trapped in the ruins of broken buildings when 7,5 magnithic earthquake struck on Friday and raised even six metres of heights.
The pyramids of the Roma buildings were widely spread to the town of Please’s town of 380 000 inhabitants.
Police arrested a 32-year-old woman arrested a woman who was stabbed to death after she was found murdered.
A woman's body in Merseyside this morning started a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7.55 in Grayson Mews on John Street.
Police are asking the persons in the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I appeal to all those in the vicinity of John Street to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on all of the taxis, especially those who may have recorded something on the dashboard video, to contact the police. They may have vital information for the investigation.
A police officer has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, a woman may have become known to a woman who has asked her where she was found.
In the course of the investigation, the police report their efforts to inform the victim of close events.
The cab driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told me that nobody would be allowed to leave the building or out of the building.
When he got word, he knew what had happened.
The residents have just found out that you can go hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was told that the entire area was currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a woman with tears at the scene of the event.
He repeated that "it's terrible".

Parliament's Cromwell statue is part of history's re-wress of re-write of history.
It would be a poetic right to evacuate pasa, given that her own fanatical Puritaanists destroyed the cultural and religious monuments of England as well as the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "type-type" and "rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate on the removal of statues would set a target for the Oliver Cromwell statue on behalf of the Westminster Palace.
Cromwell did not order nor execute iconoclasm in civil wars in England.
False Cromwell might suffer from the actions of his previous father, Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
The grand description of Sir William Hamo Thorney Cromwell from Cromwell reflects the opinion of the 1800s and it is historical evidence of a character that many still regard as worthy of praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Now, although perhaps more than now in the 1800s, Cromwell is regarded as the defender of Parliament as a defense against external pressure, which, of course, in this case, caused a monument.
Whether it is a precise description of the subject is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
At least it is certain that in the middle of the 17th century, the dispute has shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell must be identified as a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievement as a public administrator deserves to be thanked and remembered."
Kill-s Kill Kill Kill Kills Brums a Chinese farmer killed dead.
The local media are telling us that the pig has been attacked by a farmer and has killed this farmer on a market in the Southwest China.
Only the body of a man identified as "Yuan" was found near the pig market in the Guizhou province of Liupanshu. The man's chief was broken and he was in the blood of the South China Morning Post news on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, the sister prepares for vaccination of pigs in the pig population in Xining Province of Qinghai, China.
He was informed that he was travelling with his cousin from close to Yunna County on Wednesday with a view to selling 15 pigs on the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also discovered that the door of a nearby pig is open.
In a wing he said he saw a big scream with blood on his mouth.
According to the news, a criminal-technical investigation confirmed the death of a farmer who's been in a cage of 200-kg screams.
Guiyang Eventing News says the cousin Wu said, "My cousin's feet were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera image shows the cousin arriving on the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed a man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the leaders of the market told Eventing News that the pig had been locked behind a lock, so that it would not harm the rest of the police when they collected evidence at the scene of the event.
Yuan's family and office are told about the compensation for the death of a negotiated death.
The pigs are known to have attacked people before, even though it is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts. A man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, almost 300 kg of pigs were grazed by a Welsh farmer against this tractor until she managed to put the animal away from her journey.
After the event in Manitoba, an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012 told CBC News that although pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of the blood can be "a trigger".
"It's just a game.
They're like little kids, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
The remains of Hurrani Rosa’s remains bring large quantities of heavy oils for lunch in the United States of America, South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to decline as it moves above the coolest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the days to come, Rosa will bring flood floods to Northern Mexico and the United States of America for lunch.
The wind speed was 38 meters per second, i.e. the first-class Hurricane, on Sunday past the east coast of the morning, and was 620 kilometers into the southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
The pink is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure on the Pacific Sea that is heading eastwards towards the western coast of the United States. By arriving at the California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it begins to wash deep tropical moisture north towards the United States' lunches.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimetres of rain into some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Since then, tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low pressure, will form large-scale rainfalls for lunch in the coming days.
Locally 25 to 100 millimetres of rain cause dangerous heavy rainfalls and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes rain limits of between 50 and 75 millimetres per hour, particularly in Nevada and Arizona, in certain areas.
For certain areas of south-west, and in particular Arizona, it is expected that up to 50-100 millimetres of rain is expected.
The rich are possible and the circumstances can quickly decrease due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
As a result of the threat of tropical rain, it is recommended that we avoid deserting the foot of the foot.
The seals can turn the canyons into leaks, and thunderstorms can create local winds and flying dusts.
A nearby low pressure area brings local hard sauces to the coasts of South California.
The quantities of more than 10 millimetres are possible, causing small waste streams and soluble wastes.
It would be the first rain of the rainy season in the region.
The fragile tropical rainfalls are beginning to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The seals spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last throughout the Middle Week.
In October, the United States can see powerful swings in heat conditions as the Arctic region cools, but even when the tropical is relatively warm.
This sometimes causes large heat swings at short distances.
An excellent example of high temperature differences is seen in the middle of the United States on Sunday.
There are almost 20 degrees of temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omahan and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines.
The lasting heat of the summer is once again seeking to grow and expand in the coming days.
The beginning of October is expected to be broadly warm in the middle and eastern parts of the United States, while the temperature is + 26 degrees south from the plains of the south.
In New York, the temperature may hurt on Tuesday to +26 degrees, which would be approximately 4 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term forecast is that east of the United States has good potential for higher average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people considered Brett Kavanaugh’s consultation with regard to the hearing of Kavanaugh more than 20 million people.
On Tuesday, more than 20 million people saw a broadcast by six TV channels, where the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasay Ford, who accused him of sexual crime in the 1980s, gave his fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political patent situation continued at the time of the suspension of television broadcasting companies with the last moment that the FBI conducted a week-long investigation into the accusations under the agreement provided by Senator Jeff Flake, Arizona.
Ford told the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs that he was 100 % certain that he was slain by Kavanaugh and tried to take his clothes off in high school.
Kavanaugh, in turn, gave an emotional witness statement saying that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
The viewers were likely to be more than 20.4 million reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of viewers with CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPA and Fox Business Network, were not available immediately.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulties in measuring viewers who look at offices.
Some proportions indicate that the figure is equal to the number of the American football tournament game or Oscar-gaal viewers.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers of all television companies was Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported the name Kavanaugh. On average, the Channel had 5.69 million viewers throughout the day during the hearing.
ABC was the second one with 3.66 million viewers.
Nielsen told CBS that it had 3.1 million, that NBC had 2,94 million, that MSNBC had 89 million and that CNN had 2,52 million viewers.
After the hearing, interest was still high.
The center of Friday's drama was Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras described how the protestors' screams escorted him to his elevator on the way to the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday. The military forces of the Maltese Republic had previously informed him that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh.
CNN looked straight, how he stood by a minute's shop to look down when the rings were flying.
"I'll stand right in front of you," one woman said.
"You think he'll tell the truth to the people?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told.
Mr Flake said that his office had given an opinion and added, before the elevator doors were closed, that he would have more to tell us after hearing the committee.
A few hours later, the cable and general transmission networks sent directly when the Committee on Legal Affairs started to vote on Mr Kavanaugh's appointment to the vote on the Senate plenary session.
However, Flake said that it was only in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate in the coming week, as the minority Democrats have asked for.
Flake convinced his friend, democratic senator with Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made his decision after discussing with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Prime Prime Prime Prime Minister May is accusing of the criticism of critics about the Brext political policies of British Prime Minister May.
In the interview with Prime Minister Theresa May, during his interview with the newspaper Sunday Times, he was critical of the policies that threaten the future and national interests of Britain.

On the front page of May's interview, another interview was published, where his former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued his attack against May's so-called Chequers plan. Johnson calls a proposal that Britain and the EU would deal with import duties, " completely insane".

In Barcelona, six persons were arrested in connection with the association of independent protesters and mellow policemen. Thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split vote.
Police arrested the group of masked independent supporters who threw the police with eggs and powder paints, which formed dark dust clouds normally on the streets filled with tourists.
Over the day, more of the chauffeurs broke out when the cops used their beans to control the doves.
The associations between the supporters of independence and the groups of the Unionists continued for several hours, while the previous calls "no forgetting, no forgiveness", and the latter "live Spain".
The local newspaper reports that 14 people received treatment for minor injuries resulting from demonstrations.
The tension is still at stake in an area of independence one year after the October 1st referendum declared illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by the catalanic parasatists.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although the participation was low in the opponents' boycotts voting against the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, in recent year's violent encounters, nearly 1,000 people were injured when the police tried to prevent voting across the region from taking place.
Independent groups stayed outside on Friday to prevent a demonstration supporting the National Police.
However, the demonstration was organised, but it had to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who was involved in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said that there was no longer any hope for Catalonia's independence.
Last year, we had one of the best moments of our lives."
This is how my parents cry for joy when they can vote, but now we're stuck in places," he says.
In spite of the closeness achieved in last December's regional elections, despite the vital victory, the pace of the parties in favour of Catalonia's independence has slowed down this year. Many of the most well-known leaders are on a voluntary or arrested waiting for the trial of their involvement in the organisation of a referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who described a police demonstration on his phone, says politicians on both sides of the flameson dispute.
"Til's getting tense", he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the Chancellors in custody since the last nine years, announced that he would take part in the European Parliament elections next year.

From the age of 33, 34 and 39, men were arrested after the car was repeatedly reported to the house in Londonderry.
The events were held at the Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. for the UK time.

Livingston won the Rangers 1-0 Menga goal.
Dolly Mengan's first goal at Livingston ensured victory.
Series Livingston stunned Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard a second defeat in 18 matches as the manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Mengan's goal was ultimately to win Gary Holt's team, divided in second place with Hibernian.
Gerard's crew was left without the first foreign gain in the season at Premiership. Next, it will meet the next Sunday with serial director Hearts, which will be eight points ahead of it.
In the middle of the day, the Rangers will still face the Rapid Vienna European league on Thursday.
On the other hand, Livingston continued its lossless tube in a series of six matches, which the head coach Holt has not yet lost once after replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places to meet a visitor who was affected by the lack of tea tea.
The Holt team should have led a long time before it was ready for Rangers to face up to their terrible difficulties in his youth.
Scott Robinson broke through, but finalisation went wide, and next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide off the ground on the land with Craig Craftt's suit room, but he was running the ball past the ball.
The lords gave up ball management to Rangers because they knew they could vaccinated against special situations.
That's exactly the way the important goal came.
Rangers set up a free shot for Livingston, of which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga a place where he could move the ball to the centre of the penalty zone and finish it.
The Rangers had been holding the ball by then, but they found that the defense of the home team was holding, and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was barely able to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
Rangers' goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow directed the ball along another special situation in Livingston.
In addition, two situations were required for unnecessary fines - the cut-off of an exchange agent from Glenn Middleton and a hand-receiving ball.
"A wonderful performance from Livingston - analysis of the analysis.
BBC Scotland Alasair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena at the Aladdair Lamont Tony Macaroni Arena in Alaska with the BBC Scotland arena.
Great performance and result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed the expectations and was excellent for each player by passing along, continuing with the lead-outs.
The team’s way of playing and the crew have hardly changed since it rose to the highest level. However, the team must be recognised by the way in which they have strengthened the team once they arrived.
He had many heroes.
Captain Hiket was great in leading an excellent organized defense, Mengan kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall tossing the entire match.
Although there were no ideas from the Rangers.
The team has been playing very well at times under Gerrad, but it is now far from his standard.
The last input was exhausted, and they managed to open up the defense of the home team only once. This should work as a wake-up to Rangers, which is the middle of the chart.
Erdogan received a variety of different receptions in Cologne.
The smile was delicate and the sky was blue on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin breakfast.
It is the last day of the German visit by President Erdogan to Germany. The purpose of the journey is to restore relations with NATO allies.
There have been differences between human rights and freedom of the press and the aspirations of the EU in Turkey.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open a giant new raccoon.
In the city, the largest Turkish population outside Turkey lives.
The police prevented a group of 25 000 heads from gathering in front of a Muslim, on the basis of security reasons, but there were still a lot of supporters to see the President.
The protestors against 100 Erdogan, many of which were Kurdeja, also brought out their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the decision of the German Government to invite him to the country.
Fascinating demonstrations reflect the division of opinions, and some German Turkishs greet him as a hero in the pride of others as self-governance over him.

Hurricane Rosa brings a threat to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit from)
There are hardly any tropical low pressure in Arizona, but that is exactly what happens at the beginning of next week when the remains of Hurricane Roso move beyond the lunch season, bringing with them the risk of severe exposure.
The national weather service has already issued a warning about the heavy-charged floods on Monday and Tuesday from west to south and east of Arizona to Nevada, south-eastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The rose is expected to move straight across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service pointed out in its twitter that only ten tropical storms have kept the state of tropical storm or low pressure at a distance of 300 kilometers from Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was still a hurricane at a distance of 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Centre predict the rains between 50 and 100 millimetres. With the Mogolli-harjante in Arizona, it can be up to 150 millimetres in place.
In other areas, including the central rock mountains and the Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres are likely to be available. At the same time, a total of up to 100 millimetres can be reached.
The fresh rains can also be a blessing by testing the drought in the area if there is no risk of heavy rainfalls.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some rains can be useful even as severe droughts have been suffered in southern lunch.
According to the U.S.A., more than 40 % of Arizona suffers from at least the extreme drought, which is the second highest class, says Weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will make its route first to take up the land on California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, the location of Rosa is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and at that time it is still the strong wind speed of Hurrican at a speed of 135 kilometers per hour, moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
When the storm takes effect, it will destroy the cooler waters in the Pacific Sea when it comes to the end of the storm.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a powerful storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
Part of Mexico rains can be heavy and cause a significant risk of flooding.
"From California's niemy to north-eastern Sonora is expected to be 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres is possible," says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey across Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border of tropical low pressure on Tuesday hours a.m., where it will continue its journey through Arizona to South Utah by Tuesday.
"The greatest risks of the green or its remains are very severe rainfalls in California Peninsula, North-West Africa and the United States of America's lunch Islands," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rainfalls and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landscapes in mountain areas.

Trump says Kavanaugh's experienced democratic party, "insanity and anger".
"The voice on behalf of Mr. Kavanaugh is a voice against the disgraceful and disgraceful methods of the democratic party", Trump said at the meeting in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered the "indistinct and anger" of the democratic party throughout his appointment process.
Kavanaugh witnessed before Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasay Ford's accusation of sexual harassment that would have taken place decades ago during their teens.
Ford also witnessed his accusations in hearing.
The President said on Saturday, "The Americans saw Kavanaugh's specialty, nature and courage" that day.
"The voice in favour of confirming the appointment of Mr. Kavanaugh is a voice for one of the most well-known legal scholars of our time, who has excellent maritime barriers for the public service," he told his supporter group in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh in his speech on the importance of the Republican referendum in the foreign currency.
"We're five weeks away from the greatest election in our lifetime.
I wasn't just campaigning, I was campaigning all over the place," he said.
"That's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."

Hundreds dead in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, hundreds of deaths are expected, the number of deaths are expected to rise.
The authorities reported on Saturday at least 384 large earthquakes and tsunamis hit Sulawes Island in Indonesia. Many were wiped out by giant waves that hit the shores.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered together in the festival on the beach, when the waves of up to six metres high were hit by nightfalls on the shore. Many were swept to death by waves destroying everything from their path.
Csunamin caused 7,5 Magnitune powerful earthquakes.
When the tsunami threat appeared yesterday, people were still on the beach, and they did not leave immediately when they were the victims of it," says the Indonesian Agency for Relievement of major accidents in Indonesia, in Purwo Nugroho Jakarta, editor of BNPB.
"The meeting didn't come alone, but it carried cars, wooden blocks, houses and hit all over the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 km of speed in the open sea before he hit the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami alive by climbing into trees, he tells us.
About 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The weather photos published by the disaster agency appear to be a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosaic around the water.
Follow-up was still on Saturday at the coast of the city.
The earthquakes seemed to be in the area where 2.4 million people live.
BPPT, the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology, gave an opinion that the energy released on Friday’s vast earthquake was responsible for about 200 atom bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima’s Second World War.
It says that a long and narrow city along the narrow bay might have sprained the tsunamis.
Nugro described the destruction as a "wider" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had fallen apart.
He told us that some of the victims' bodies were found in the ruins of the fallen buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage could be greater than the Pala 300 kilometers north on a continuous coast, the region called Donggala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communications "are completely broken, and there is no information about Donggala" says Nugroho.
According to the Red Cross statement, over 300 000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse," he said.
On Saturday, the Agency was widely criticised for not telling the tsunami that hit the Palace, although the authorities said the waves had arrived during the warning.
In the amateur video distributed in social media, the man on the upper floor of the building calls on the people who approach warnings from the tsunamis on the street.
Just minutes later, there will be a water wall on the beach that will take you to buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the image material.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a wide-ranging power failure that cut off communications Please turn around. This made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The authorities are telling us that the army has started sending help from Jakarta and other cities by means of transport, but you still need food and other basics.
The city airport has been reopened only for assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wadodon was to visit Please leave the evacuation centres on Sunday.
The number of victims of Indonesia tsunamis exceeds 800.
It's really bad.
The personnel of World Vision Donggala have reached safety Please enter the city where they have been housed in the tent decks of the office’s interior. On their way they passed the scene of destruction, says Dosaba.
"They told me that they saw a lot of ruined houses," he says.
It's really bad.
At the initiative of the assistance groups, some complained that foreign aid workers will be prevented from travelling to Pala.
According to the Indonesian provisions, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start to flow once the accident area is declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened yet.
"There is still a disaster at the regional level," says Aulia Arroni, editor of the Red Cross of Indonesia.
"As the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can begin receiving international assistance, but the declaration has not yet been made."
When the other night landed above the House after the Friday earthquake and the tsunami, friends and family members who were lost lived up to the hope that their nearby miracle trade would differ from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was picked up from the sink.
On Sunday, rescue workers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, Head of the Indonesian Dependant Team, had trained two missing addicts for Asian races previously completed this month.

Konye West: Räpperpert will change the name Ye
Rupper Kanye West will change the name Ye.
When he announced a change on Twitter on Saturday he wrote: "The character who used to be known as Kanye West".
Ye has been a 41-year-old West nickname for a while, and he also used it as the name of his eighth album published in June.
A change in his future performance in Saturn Night Live, where he is expected to publish his new album called Yandhi.
He replaced the program by a singer, Ariana Grande, who, according to the creator of the program, cancelled his participation in the "accuracy" program for the reasons of his participation.
West has previously told him that the word also has religious significance for him, apart from being shortened by his professional name.
Talking about the name of the album earlier this year with the radio director Big Boy, West said, "I believe that "yes" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it is the meaning of "you".
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanya, which means true, and ended up in the shortest form of Ye, who just manifests us with the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything.
It's mostly about who we are.

Mexico AMLO promises not to use an army against civilians against civilians.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, elected President of Mexico, promised that he would never use military force against civilians. The announcement came on the 50th anniversary of the revenge of students on the land.
Lopez Obrador, who was on Saturday at Ttelolco Plaza, promised that "no military would ever use an army for the repression of the Mexican people.
The armed forces launched a peaceful demonstration on 2 October 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing colleges were about to enter Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly study grants and by opening more free public universities free of charge.
He said that the lack of unemployment and the lack of access to education and training is driving young people into criminal gangs.
The USA should double the financing of artificial intelligence research funding.
The United States should double its funding for the investigation of artificial intelligence by making China more efficient its activities in this field. This is what Google, Microsoft and Apple have been working on and by Kai-Fu Lee, an artificial professional.
The opinion was advanced by the services on artificial intelligence in various parts of the administration of the United States, although the United States lacks a formal artificial intelligence strategy.
In the meantime, China presented its plan already last year: it aims to lead the development of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The duplication of the artificial research budget would be a good start, given that other countries are so much behind the United States, and that we are looking for the next breakthrough of artificial intelligence" says Lee.
The duplication of funding could double the probability that the next significant artificial intelligence recovery would be done in the United States, Lee told me this week in the CNBC interview.
A book entitled "The Great Powers of Artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Cost. He works as CEO of the Singing Venture, which has established one of China's most important artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University, which struck the highest-ranking Otello player in the United States. Later he was the head of Microsoft Research and the head of Google China's activities.
Lee accepted previous American technology competitions such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when to arrange for the next identification of future visionaries.
Lee says US researchers worked hard to get public aid.
"The academic influences don't take China, they take the big corporations," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting universities' tops to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee also said that the changes in immigration policy could help the United States to improve their artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think that the doctoral degree of artificial intelligence should be given automatically green cards," he said.
In July 2017, the Government of the People’s Republic of China’s next generation development plan for artificial intelligence.
The Chinese National Science Foundation grants funding to people working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is weaker in China, Lee said.
The Ministry of Defence established earlier this year the Defense Department Joint Legal Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together industrial and academic partners in the world. The White House has also announced the establishment of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
DARPA also announced in this month a $ 2 billion investment in AI Next for an initiative.
In turn, NSF invests over $100 million annually in an artificial intelligence investigation.
At the same time, the legislative initiative to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not been forward for months.
In a referendum, the Russians changed the name of the country's name by a referendum.
In the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia". This change would solve the decades of dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country's efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
In the opinion of Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, the name of the northern neighbours is, in practice, a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its access to EU and NATO membership.
In June, the governments of the countries will conclude an agreement on a new name, but, in the opinion of national opponents, the change would undermine the ethnic identity of a majority in the Republic of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum and that the campaign against the vote will raise doubts as to whether the vote will reach the required limit of 50% in order to allow the result to be legal.
The question in the vote was: "Are you on the side of NATO and EU membership by adopting an agreement with Greece".
Supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev reason that it is worth paying the price to allow Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek to become a member of both the EU and NATO. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
"I have come today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said a 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje, a 79-year-old named Olivera Georgievska.
Although the vote is not legally binding, many Members in Parliament have said that they respect the outcome of the vote so that it has a decisive effect.
A change in name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities were reported by 13 a.m.
However, the voting rate was only 16, compared to 34 % of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when at last 66 % of the voting rights were put to a vote.
"I came to vote for my children and we are in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
Prime Minister Zorran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018. This change would open the way for NATO and EU membership .
Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old, prepared a small stage and set chairs in favour of a referendum in front of the tents set up by the boys on behalf of the Skopje Parliament.
"We carry NATO and the EU, but we want to join the heads standing, not through the kitchen door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn around, such as China and Russia, as part of the euro area of integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring needed investment in Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe in the vote by a large majority in favour of the roll-calling, because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO," said Zaev after giving his voice.
He said the word "yes" is "enhancing our future".
The opinion published by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia on Monday referred to the vote of 30-43% in the referendum - that is to say, the below required activity.
57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday, during the second survey by Telma TV in Macedonia.
Of them, 70% said they would vote in favour of a yes option.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the voting rate must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of a referendum would be the first serious setback to the noble-minded government, when it came to power in May of last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero hit the entire Brighton defence defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear discovery of Brighton's defence against Manchester City's 2-0 victory at the Etihad stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made the painting at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the picture, the Argentinaese lead player was fed from the middle field.
He found an empty space outside the field by rushing through three Brighton defensemen.
Then Aguero found it surrounded by four green shirts.
He was by one of the defenders and then left several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty zone.
Then he found Sterling by handing the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first contact within the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed the Brighton guard on the right-angled shot of Mathew Ryan's goal.
The City Manager Pep Guardiola told the journalists that "Aguero has problems with his legs.
"We said he'd play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
Fortunately, he scored in that time frame.
However, Sterling had already given the sky blue an interest in the election contest.
The painting came on the 29nd floor with a playbook.
Aguero was in a situation with a ball in a deep part of Brighton's territory.
He gave a beautiful push-through to Leroy Sanelle on the left.
Sane took a few contacts before sending the ball back to Sterling.
The attack on the sky blues was just before the end of the ball.
City will meet Hoffenheim's champions in the middle of the league on Tuesday at 12:55 Rhein-Neckar-Arene in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer would like to be a cheerpiler in a fight against the Rockies against the Rockies.
The Nationals are out of the playoff, so why are you trying to get a crowd at the start-up meeting?
At the same time, Scherzer hopes that he will take the input heat at the Sunday fight against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies still have a playoff. They have one victory at the difference between Los Angeles Dodges in the western series.
At least he got a wild card from the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first division win.
"Even though we do not have a stake, we can at least get up to the feeder, knowing that the public and the other team's budget atmosphere here in Denver will create me the most demanding competitive arrangement I've ever faced this year.
Why don't I want to take a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet published their beginners on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Scherzer an opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, and he'd play 34 at the start of his game and feed on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington Right-hand player has a 18-7 winning/loss ratio during this period. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and he has burned the hitter's nest 300 times, with the exchange rate of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia, West Virginia, West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to his Supreme Court's Judge-Rapporteur, Brett Kavanaugh, to the situation, while at the same time speaking about the importance of the Republican referendum in the field of arbitration.
"All our achievements are in the game in November.
We're five weeks away from the biggest election in our lifetime.
This is one of the very big ones -- not only of the campaign, but of the campaign, and that's why I'm going around everywhere to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening now.
They have decided to return to the throne by any means possible, you can see their misfortune and evilness.
They don't choose who to be harmed or who must be run away so that they can gain power, and that's what they want, they want strength and power, but we don't give it to them.
He said that the Democrats took the task of "responsibility and non-responsibility".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the evil and the evil and the evil and the evil and the evil and the lying."
In his reference to the greatest influence of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Dianne Feinstein, the public replied with a loud boubut.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you file a document?
Uh, what?
Well, no, I'm waiting a bit - it was a really bad body language - the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerance congregation.
It does not tolerate those who say their opinions.
I wasn't surprised when my local party Momentum activists supported a motion of censure against me.
At last, I'm just a line of last representatives from Labourur, who I'm telling you that I'm not welcome - just because we say what we say.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated in the same way only because he was strongly opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was critical of my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, irony, similar topics that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "We want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
The majority of the eight years that I have been a local representative of Labourur have been exactly what the Friday meetings of the Council have been.
Many of the meetings now do not follow that tone of voice, and the "friendly and gentler" policy has long been forgotten if it even began.
It is even more clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates different opinions and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether or not it is appropriate for the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues who thought I had shared a similar political view began to expect me to turn around and make statements that I would never have agreed on, whether it was national security or the internal EU market.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it does not really matter what I say - the result is that the belt of insults in social media, where my choice is required to be withdrawn, rejection of the central policy and find out that I should not be in the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I really know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are, at least, political in nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who meet daily sexist and racist insults, and never fail.
The normalisation of treatment is one of the most disturbing aspects of the policy of this period.
Last week Jeremy Corby demanded that the Labour Party adopt a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a party to adopt different opinions, and with every motion of censure or change in selection, the party will become only limited.
For two years, I have been told to keep a low profile and refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "all goes well".
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the failure to meet the single school of Thatcher's government, I have tried to promote better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered my political line, not even the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or differences with the current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state moves towards a brochure that is damaging households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy to question my trust in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my voters: I represent you with honor, and the threat of separation or the promotion of a political career does not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your interests.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: Undefeated Ayr in the division of Ayr.
The last two minutes of the goal slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr was without doubt worthy of winning the day in the entertaining Tennent's Premiership game.
Ayr is now the only team at the top of the table, out of ten, who has not lost any fights.
After all, the excellent defense and the more successful taking of risks were the one that supported them, and Coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied for a reason.
"We have been challenged in our fights, and we are still undefeated, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrosen Robyn Christie says, "All honors to Ayri, they took risks better than we did."
At 14 minutes, Ayr went to the lead with Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion shot, but the Scottish captain Roy Hughes' yellow card enabled Melrose's rise, and Jason Baggott scored the goal.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in the penalty country, and just before half time he scored the goal and succeeded in the conversion shot, increasing Ayri's leadership to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well with Patrick Anderson's goal, whose conversion shot Baggot managed to narrow the difference between five points.
There was a long delay when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and caught out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his lead with the Stafford McDownall goal of the conversion shot Climo managed.
Captain Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, after which Melrosen Bruce Colvine made a hard-press after a hard-pressed paint that failed the conversion kick.
The home team replied, however, when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from the ball-free Climo retaliation, and Macpherson made a goal from the one on the side of Ary's taste from the side of the goal.
Climo succeeded in the conversion shot the same way he did before, and Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's kick and pulled Gregor Henry to finish the fifth goal of the team.
The star of the Still Game series starts in the restaurant industry.
The star of the Still Game series Ford Kieran has been appointed head of a licensed restaurant company and will probably start working in the restaurant as well.
A 56-year-old actor presents Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program, which he manuscripts with his co-partner Greg Hemphill.
Two has announced that the next nine season is the last of the series, and it seems that Kierna is planning her life after Craiglang.
According to the public records, he has been identified as head of the Adriftmor's Limited company.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of the Scottish Sun magazine suggested that Kierna wanted to include Glasgow in a flourishing restaurant business.
"Mer belongs to us": the inland state Bolivia is trying to get back to the Pacific Ocean by law.
Marines patrolled outside the base of the fleet in La Paz.
In the flags of public buildings, the sea blue flag will be floating in the flags of public buildings.
The ship's base areas for the Titicacalta Amazon have been created with a clause: "Just the sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In Bolivia, the memory of Chile’s beach line lost in the 20th century resource war, which is still in its domestic ice, is still strong – as is the long-awaited view of the Pacific Ocean once again.
The hope is at least for decades when Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice to take a decision on 1 October after five years of consideration.
"Bolivia has a strong degree of progress, a spirit and a sense of sensation, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for a final solution," said the Bulgarian diplomat Roberto Calzad.
As the following wishes around the country, the International Court of Justice has decided on a large screen, hoping that the Hague will be in favour of – at the end of the decades of the broken debate – Bolivia’s position on the fact that Chile has a duty to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who faces the re-election of the contested fight next year, has a lot to play next Monday's direction.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he assured me by the end of August.
Although some of the analysts believe that the Court is unlikely to decide in the interest of Bolivia, and even if it were decided, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch UN institution has no competence to release Chile's administration, and ICJ has also announced that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that ICJ's decision is adopted only six months after the final submission of statements suggests that the case "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilen expert on international law.
In addition, the last four years have been slowing down rather than promoting Bolivia's intentions.
"Now Bolivian Administration has taken the question of maritime connections," said Zárate.
Morales's argument - challenging rhetoric has been suppressed all the time by the chiles' charity, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at a certain time, but it is very difficult to organise negotiations after that.
In either country, there has been no second embassy since 1962.
The former President and Representative of Bolivia in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, do not accept the view that the judgment of the Court of Justice would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relationships with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the difference that lasted for 139 years for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, would have used the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up his right to connect with the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea announced North Korea that nuclear proliferation will not happen unless it can rely on the United States of America to the United States of America.
North Korea is not going to give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea.
Rii spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the United States that he would keep the promises made by the Heads of State at the Singapore Summit.
Rin's statement came just before the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo is about to begin again with the nuclear weapons of the BIP, only three months after the US met Kim Jong Unin in Singapore.
Ri said there was a "a long dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the end declaration of the Korean war would bring on North Korea's knees.
Before Pjongjang has first taken important measures to promote arms exploitation, Washington is equipped to adopt a declaration.
Both Kim and the President of the United States Donald Trump want a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would be about to abandon the armed armour, which the State is likely to see as the only real means of guaranteeing its own security, has gained widespread doubts about its part.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pjongjang next month to prepare the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows show the main features of the latest model size of the newest collection, which will soon be on your near future.
If you want to increase your hat collection or cover the sun completely, you don't have to keep looking for.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne, in their SS19 design show, revealed a range of special super-poored headphones that would cloud the style of Paris fashion weeks.
The very inefficiencies took over Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their amazing creations also to fashion shows.
The most striking creation of Valentino was a beige hat with wide feathers, which covered the heads of the models almost entirely.
Other oversized settlements were watermelon, velvette, and even pineapple — but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of distinctive masks – just right before Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips, and they reminded me more of Hannibal Lecter than top fashion.
One creation with a snorkel and a mask reminded me of more diving equipment, and the other reminded me of a melted ice-cold roll.
And if you want to take a stand on behalf of the great-sized fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of the form predict that huge vertices are about to appear in the street picture.
The oversized hats are closely followed by "La Bomba", which has a half-milly shoulder hat, which has been seen from all Rihan to Emily Ratajkowski.
In social media, a large number of unusual hat cults were drawn to the fashion shows of the second coco creation – a beach bag made of straw, which is almost as large as the model bearing it.
The burnt orange strip bag on white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 design in Paris.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm gonna see large-scale hats and beach bags in the street next summer – designers have made such a great impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-scale housing."
John Edward: Language skills are essential skills for a global citizen.
The results of private schools in Scotland have traditionally been good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good tests. Success has been enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community projects.
Over 30 000 students from Scotland, represented by the Scottish private school council SCIS, are seeking to provide high-quality services for their pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for their chosen careers, for further and higher education, and for the population of the world.
The training industry, which can design and implement tailored study content, has seen the position of languages as a popular and hoped for teaching at continuous educational institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head."
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to create relationships with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's trial, we will find that languages are at the top of the series for a clear percentage of private schools.
68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages reached the highest rating A.
According to the data, students who received the best rating A, 72 per cent studied Mandarin Chinese, 72 per cent studied German, 69 per cent studied French and 63 per cent studied Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland will support studying foreign languages as essential skills, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, they are available for free choice, but they are kept at the same value as natural resources (research, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school learning program and elsewhere.
On the basis of the questionnaire made by the UK Employment Office in 2014, 17% of the situations where the employer had difficulty finding a suitable job were explained by lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary to promote career development for young people in the future.
The more potential jobs require language skills, the more essential these skills are in the global world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have an advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of what career he has chosen.
Kyky communicates directly with a foreigner to make a language-qualified person automatically in advance of competition.
According to YourGov's 2013 survey, over 4 000 adults from Isobritan are unable to have a conversation in a foreign language, and French was the only language with a two-digit number of 15%.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching languages for the children of the present day.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of the developing countries gives children a better opportunity to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ from one another in what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important for the Isobritanians in 2020, such as Mandarins and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interests, private schools always have a number of language options taught by specialised teachers.
Scotland's private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future will bring upon them.
In this time, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be very important for the future of the country, so this should reflect education.
The current languages should indeed be seen as "international communication skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice freedom, diversity and a high level of education for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron makes debuty on Sunday in San Diego, San Diego, San Diego.
The waiting for the supporters waiting for LeBron James's first performance in the Los Angeles Lakers line is almost over.
Coach Luke Walton of Lakes has announced that James will play on Sunday for Denver Nuggets against San Diego before the beginning of the season in a game to be played.
But how many minutes he'll really play, you'll be able to see.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said Walton Lakers on the official website.
The Lake Journal Mike Trudell Twiitt said that James is probably playing silent minutes.
James, who followed the exercises earlier this week, was asked about his plans for the Lakers before throughout the six matches to be played.
"At this point, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare for my career," he said.
Time of the popular Western Virginia campaign, YouTube Channel, YouTube Channel.
President Donald Trump will start a series of election campaigns today in Wheeling in Western Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five next week's planned election events, including agreeable targets such as Tennese and Mississippi.
While waiting for the vote, in order to fulfil the free position of the Supreme Court Judge, Trump will endeavour to increase support for future elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing a majority in Congress elections in November.
What time is the Trump Western Virginia campaign today and how can you see it online?
The event of the Trump’s Western Virginia Wheel will begin at 19:00 p.m. on Saturday 29.9.2018.
You can view the Trump’s Western Virginia campaign event online as a Livester event via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will probably take this week's highest court case against Brett Kavanaugh's hearing, which became intense in the light of the accusations of sexual harassment, which have delayed the Senate's confirmation vote after a week in the FBI's investigation of the accusations made during the FBI's investigation.
But the priority for a series of campaigns is to support the success of Republican candidates in strict November elections.
Thus, the comments from President Trump's campaign were made on the purpose of these five events of the following week, "to protect voluntary and profitable Republicans and to expand the majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters, according to Reuters.
"Kongress's control is so important for his purpose that the President is prepared to travel to as many states as possible during the urgent campaign", Reuters told Reuters about the Trump campaign as an anonymous representative.
Today's venue is located in Wesbanco Arena Wheeling, and you can arrive at the supporters even in "Ohito and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" West Virginia Metro News from West Virginia.
Saturday is Trump's second visit to Western Virginia during the past month, in a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump supports the presidential candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been left behind in the polls of the Republican President of Western Virginia.
"It is not a good signal from the point of view that the President is trying to raise his support for the opinion," said the political scientist Simon Haeder from the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team will show the fight effort to hope ahead before Sunday alone games.
After the three-sided session, Saturday afternoon four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the power to strengthen success itself is a totally invented phenomenon in sport, players believe it, and more and more in this kind of tournament.
Where is this success power they believe to be at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed down to four, so we take this success as a hippie," said Jordan Spieth walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, a priority: four points above and 12 to be played.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a bit of wind in the sails and a lot of things to encourage, such as Spieth and Justin Thomas, to play all day together and get three points out of four.
Spieth has been powerful from you to the green, leading the example.
The brawling throat sounds of the festival were getting stronger when he succeeded in a critical putter in order to equal the match to four when he and Thomas were two points left after two holes.
The floor where they won the 15th match followed a similar scream that gave us the idea that he believes that the US team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus very well and worry only about your own fight", Spieth said.
That's the only thing these players have left.
18 holes make an impact.
The only players who have received more points when Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
A special European, but sweet twin has won four four four flawlessly.
"Moliwood" was the only twin that did not make any bongs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bongs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That round, and the way they give and get energy from this poor public, confirms that they are the presidings of Sunday. And when the sun drops at Le Golf National, another popular player to ensure Europe's possible victory could not be like Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather have both different holes at the same time.
However, the speeches about Europe's success are premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcian, a teamed with Alex Noren, who was a hero of four in the morning.
One bogi and two doublebogs in the first nine holes dug the Spanish and Swedish into such a deep hole that they were not nearly there to survive.
On Sunday, no one's coming to help you out of the pit.
The fourball and the four-player are fascinating to follow close to the couple from the point of view of cooperation: what kind of advice they give or leave without giving, and how the strategy can change at the moment.
Europe has played a better role as a team until now and has taken a significant lead before the last day, but this four-game has shown that the US team has a battle challenge, although in particular in the United States it has been suspected.
Europe will take the 10-6 leaders before the last day of the Ryder Cup Day.
Europe is in good leadership before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they took on Saturday's four-balls and four-games 10-6 lead from the United States of America.
The great twin Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led a two-win win-win from Tiger Woods, and reached a score high to four points today at Le Golf National.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who made a great effort to maintain two years ago in Hazelininen, ruled the low-ball US team in the morning, taking a match to the situation of 3-1 in the morning.
The United States was a harder opponent in four games, winning two matches, but they could not narrow the lead.
Jim Furykin's half took eight points from Sunday 12 of the double game to keep a win.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, who are also called "Mollwood", were a sensational weekend after Ryder Cup in the history of another twin that has won four points in the first four games.
After breaking up at Woods and Patrick Reed in the first four-ball, they then completed 5-4 of the top-down Woods and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau, Bryson Dechambeau, even more strongly.
Woods, who barely survived through the two matches on Saturday, were at times great, but has lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-games, and even seven-fold.
Justin Rose rested in the morning with the four-balls, but returned to the four-game with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 Dust for Johnson and Brooks for Koepka, who are the first and third in the king.
Europe did not get everything it wanted in this fresh and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
The triple value enhancer Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States of America at two points on Saturday.
They're going to get a big two-to-one win from Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-balls, and later a 4-3 victory from Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a four-game after the first two holes were destroyed.
Just twice in Ryder Cup's history, the team has risen from four points of pursuit to levels at the start of two games, even though Furyk's side of the game is also enough to maintain victory.
In fact, after two days the second best can be that Sunday counter-attack has been overrepresented.
North Korea's "no doubt" will take off its own weapons without confidence in their confidence.
The North Korean foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions only increased confidence in the United States, and under these conditions there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Riong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that during the last year North Korea has taken "a significant set of good-good measures", such as the end of nuclear and missile experiments, has landed the site of nuclear tests and promised that North Korea will not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"But we haven't seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so under such circumstances it is not possible that we take off our arms unilaterally,"
While Ri repeated the fact that Washington did not accept the phased nuclear abandonment in which North Korea would be rewarded for every intermediate issue, its statement is, however, significant in the sense that unilateral arms withdrawal is not completely excluded, as Pjongjang has done in the past.
He referred to the joint statement given by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first U.S. president and North Korean President's Summit in Singapore on 12 June, Singapore, Kim assured us that "the Korean Peninsula was removed from nuclear weapons" and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has been trying to formally decide on the war in Korea between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has demanded that Pjongjang should first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of the strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The United States are calling for a "nuclear withdrawal first," and have increased pressure through sanctions to achieve their goals with violence – even against "the peace statement", Ri said.
"I am sorry that sanctions would get us to our knees is the hope of those who are indifferent to us.
But the problem is that continuous sanctions only deepen our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself, however, stressed to the UN earlier this week.
On the other hand, the Minister stressed three meetings with the Director of South Korea, Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: "If the party who claimed to take off the weapons would have been South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such a dead end."
However, Rin's tone was considerably different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the approach of the missiles towards the continents was inevitable after "bad President" Trump called Kim on his suicide intention to be "a missile man".
Last year Trump threatened "to destroy completely" North Korea. But this year, Trump gave thanks to Kim for his courage to approach the abandonment of weapons, but still stressed that there was still a lot of work left to be done and the sanctions to remain as long as North Korea gave up nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday Trump mentioned that he didn't have time to spend, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argued that the UN Security Council should reward the progress already made by Pjongjang.
However, on Thursday, the US Minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council that "the strengthening of the sanctions of the Security Council must continue to take place as strong and without failure as long as we prove that we have a complete, final and reinforced nuclear abandonment."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened its sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to halting the financial channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles in Pjongjang.
Pompeo met with North Korea Rin during the UN General Assembly, and he also announced that he would visit Pjongjang next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit did not go smoothly.
As he left Pjongjang, he described the progress made. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangsterical requirements" only a few hours later.
North Korea committed to the closure of the missile base and nuclear facility at the meeting with Secretary General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States is taking "the corresponding measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "measured measures" for security guarantees to which Trump committed at the Singapore meeting, and moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete an adequate resting course for the course to guide the course to guide a sufficient rest.
All undergraduate students at Harvard University are taking part in this year's course aimed at increasing student rest. The course is countered by the university's flourishing macho culture, where students weigh a long night with caffeine strength.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant about fundamental issues related to their own welfare.
The course has been designed by Professor Charles Czeisler of the University of Harvard Medical Faculty, who is working on a sleep research in Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its species in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course, lectured on the impact of sleep shortages on learning.
"A young woman came to my speech after I said, 'Why do I not hear it until now, my last year of study?'"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he told him about the interview with Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course will teach students how true dreams support academic and sporting performances and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Medical Sciences at Harvard University and Vice-President of University Health Services, says that the university has completed the course after they had heard about how students suffer from severe sleepiness during the course of the study week.
The hourly rate includes a number of interactive tasks.
A picture of the apartment room for students is presented in one section where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thereby obtaining information about the effects of caffeine and light, and about the impact of sleepiness on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
The second section tells participants how long a sleepiness can raise the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
The map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this has no immediate impact on student behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know these matters in exactly the same way as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler more.
All night long study traumas are still a subject of pride, according to Professor Czeisler, and the ever-growing pressures of modern technology and students made the sleep deficit a growing problem.
To achieve a sufficient and high-quality sleep should be the stress, fatigue and anxiety of students, and even the increase in weight, as sleepiness causes a state of vision that is similar to that of the brain, which is why man is constantly hungry," Professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical psychology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to plan the course after he had participated in one of his courses during his first year in Harvard last year.
He tells the course to open his eyes and let the attack on all campus students to organise a comprehensive course.
He hopes that all advanced students can complete a similar study course before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students be reminded of the time of sleep in addition to morning awakening, and urges them to keep in mind the side effects of electronic display devices and LED lighting on the ‘Blue Light’ day-time series, which may make it difficult to sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mengan's launch took the victory of Gerrard's players.
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers once again had a loss day when Dolly Mengan's launch broke through defense brought Livingston a 1-0 victory.
Gary Holt's team, however, won this time, and Gerrad only won his second defeat during his 18-game manager career. Rangers left eight points at the end of the election from Hearts' current leader.
Menga hit the ball goal seven minutes before the half-time, and the Rangers did not lose a battle battle after that the adjusted situation was over.
The Rangers fell in the game as a result of the sixth position. Livingston has instead climbed to third place, and the score above is only Hibernia.
The Rangers may face other problems, as Calum Spence was injured during the game in the hit of an object thrown from a foreign screen and the wound has been treated.
Gerard made eight exchanges for the assembly where the team had hit Ayri and advanced Scotland's league for semifinals.
At the same time, Holt continued with the Liv 11 assembly, where the team took the score from Hearts last week. The same strategy once again produced the result when a well-structured assembly managed to discipline the opponent in almost every turn.
While the Rangers managed to dominate the holding of the ball, Livingston was better off using situations for his own benefit.
Livingston had the opportunity to paint in two minutes when Menga's first entry gave Scott Pittman a free ride to the Allan McGregor goal, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Then Keaghan Jacobs directed his free shot to Craig Halkett, but another defenseman Alan Lithgow managed to just snoop his way into the back seat.
Rangers took control of the game on the other hand, but in the last third air of the game there was no longer confidence in themselves.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when at fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had met each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the request from Colombia.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly refused to bother Lassana Coulibaly's bag and Ovie Ejaria's victory shot.
The goal of Livingston at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not simply due to the hard work of the team.
Rangers still couldn't do anything to Jacobs' long-term input transactions.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who may have cold-headed the ball for Menga for easy paint.
On the switcher Gerrad decided to change Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change affected the game almost immediately when Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack stopped Kelly's impressive rapid defence.
Livingston put visitors to play their own game again while Lithgow and Haket continued long input after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise their leadership in the final moments of the game. However, McGregor’s fine defense prevented Jacobs’ intentions before Lithgow reached his position.
Glenn Middleton, who became a member of the Rangers exchange, also called for a penalty shot to be brought together with Jacobs, but Thomson again looked away.
Almanak: Geigermeter inventions
Next page of our Sunday Morning event: September 30th, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, future physics, was born in Germany today 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which later led to the development of a gayer measurer in the development of a well-known device.
For example, it is well suited to the film "Coronado watches", published in 1950, where Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present scientists that are quite influenced by herds:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a gay meter. It's used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation in minerals."
Evans: "Look, now it's really riding!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The idea that carries his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system ‘to see’ bad-quality cells.
The new cancer vaccine is capable of teaching the immune system “to see” bad-quality cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment.
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and converted into the laboratory in the laboratory.
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body after treatment are able to ‘see’ several types of typical proteins that are typical to be used in many cancers.
The vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, cancer cells in patients with ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify bad cells.
In the course of the procedure, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and converted into a laboratory in such a way that they are able to ‘see’ the typical HER2 proteins for several cancers. The modified cells are then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "Our results indicate a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "support the growth of several types of cancer", Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer as well as ovary, lungs and colon."
A similar approach – taking resistant cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West got into critics' teeth after praising the Trumps Saturday Night Live campaign on his head.
The presentation did not go as planned planned the presentation did not go as planned planned the presentation was scheduled as scheduled as planned planned.
Kanye West got his neck in the Saturday Night Live program after praising the sharp style of President Donald Trump and informing him of his desire to be president in the 2020 elections.
Following his third copy of "Ghost Town" Trump's Make America Great Agai's campaign campaign, the West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
"When I talk to a white man, they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism were a problem, I would have changed America a long time ago," he says.
Last night's broadcast began in a series where Matt Damon iried Brett Kavanaugh to consult the Senate Legal Committee. The hearing relates to the arguments put forward by Christine Blasay Ford concerning Kavanaugh's sexual harassment.
The West dam was not presented in direct transmission, but the comet Chris Rock downloaded it into a broken social media.
It's not clear if Rock's purpose is to mock West with his post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had been swept up in a corner because of the hat he held on his head.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me I shouldn't go on the stage with this hat in my head.
I've been bullied.
Then they say I'm in the margin," West says in the Washington Camera interview.
West continues: "Do you want to see what the margin means?" and says she's dressed for her Superman reference because "so you can't determine what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love me."
According to the map, West's comments made the audience bouts at least twice, and the show performers seemed embarrassed. One of the present described the situation in the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio was completely quiet."
West was chosen for a short warning period to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused confusion in many viewers by presenting a song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is receiving support from Candace Turner, the head of a conservative TPUSA organization, who praised this courage on Twitter: "WHITE THE UNIVERSE".
However, Karen Hunter, a discussion programme director, pointed out that West "is just his own self, which is all the time wonderful".
"But I can decide upon a person (by taking this music or look or by supporting this "art", which I consider to be supporting and spreading an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's a free person.
It's the same as us," he added.
Before tonight's show on Twitter, the rapper announced that he changed his name to "the person who was previously known as Kanye Westna".
West is not an artist who will change his first name. The musician follows Diddy here, which is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, and we also remember, of course, the Prince of the late music legend who changed his name to the symbol and later as an artist known before Prince.
Indicting the murder attempted to commit a murder attempted to commit an attempted murder in Belfast, Belfast is charged with the result of the prosecution of the target of an attempted murder attempted by Belfast.
A 45-year-old man is charged with murder after being stabbed at a restaurant in Eastern Belfast on Friday.

The actor star of the throne game, Kit Harington, is attacking toxic masculism.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-shakeing hero role as Jon Snow'na HBO in the violent fantasy series Valtasin game.
However, Harrington has attacked the stereotype of Macosakar: a 31-year-old actor believes that such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with strength.
In an interview with the cultural association of the Thursday Times magazine Harrington, he doubts that "someone has gone wrong" in this case, and questions the means available to address toxic masculinity #MeToo in the age of the phenomenon.
Recently, too, Harrington, married to Rose Leslie, also 31-year-old Rose Leslie, is admitting that she has a strong desire to address the subject.
"The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is that I have strong feelings at the moment" he says.
"What have men been taught about their growth in years that have led to problems that are now being observed?"
Harrington believes that television and the highly masculine characters present in it are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: "What's the maid and what's learned?
What is learned on TV and on the streets that make young boys feel like they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the major issues of our time – how can we change this?
Young men have something really bad for themselves."
In the interview he also admits that he would not participate in the production of pre- or extension parts of the Valtan Panel after the series ends next summer, because he has, according to his own words, "has been given the need to fight fields and horses".
In November, Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play by True West, who is talking about the film producer and this mugger.
The performer recently revealed that getting to know his future Rose wife was the best thing that the Valtanal Game has offered her.
"I met my wife on this show, so somehow it lets me become my family and my life ever since," she says.
Rose Leslie was an actor in Ygritte's play by Harrington's acting Jon Snow's love target in Emmy's prized fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple were married at the premises of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDSs: The number of new infections has increased by 14 % in China by 14 % in China.
China has reported an increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens by 14%.
According to the health authorities, the virus affects more than 820 000 lives in the country.
Some 40,000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change to previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the Chinese health authorities at the conference in Yunnan, HIV infections have been reduced to almost zero in this way.
A year later, however, the number of HIV infected and AIDS infected people in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
Sexual HIV infections are an acute issue in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be common.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually get married to women because of conservative values in the country.
Many cases of disease result from insufficient protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised to guarantee the overall availability of HIV medicines as part of measures to address the problem.
Maxine Waters contests the information of a worker who leaks the data of a Republican Republican Editor who leaks the information of the employee's leaking of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denied the arguments that his staff would have published personal information on the website of Wikipedia, which concerns them.
A parliamentary representative from Los Angeles assured that the claims are made by "extremist" commentators and websites.
"Wars, lies and more contemptable lies", says the opinion on Waters Twitter published on Twitter.
Among the published information, it is reported that there were the home addresses and telephone numbers of the Senator of South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, and the senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, representing Utah State.
The unknown person published information on Thursday from the US Congress during the hearing of the Senate Committee, which concerned the prosecution of sexual abuses of the Supreme Court of the Member of the Court of Justice of Brett Kavanaugh.
The bleeding happened a little after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Punders and RedState, report that, according to the Hillin newspaper, the messages were published on the IP address attached to the Waters office and by a person belonging to Waters staff.
"This unwarranted accusation is completely wrong, and it is an absolute lie", Water continued.
"My employees, whose identity, identity and security have been compromised by these unfair and false charges, are not in any way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This unwarranted accusation is totally wrong and absolutely wrong."
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, and the critics were also involved with the former press secretary, Ari Fleischer, of the White House.
"The way he disputes this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is incompatible with the membership of Congress.
When the person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There's no reason to be proud.
There is no reason to question the motives of the prosecution.
The situation should behave moderately and calmly."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the criticisms of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate, Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in Congress elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievably if that's true," he's making a reference to.
Waters announced in his opinion that he had contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement bodies for these sincere accusations.
"We find that the authors are exposed," he continued, "and that they will be placed under legal responsibility for all or all of my staff's destructive and dangerous actions against the members of my staff."
Johnny English will strike again – under-efficient Rowan Atkinson agent party.
It has already been established to look for brexit references to any film that is somewhat expensive to Britain. However, this does not appear to fit the Johnny English-enhanced Business and Codymist series, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and re-resurrectioned in the extension of 2011 "Johnny English – Newborn".
Is the language of the nation's satirs made in the cheek to become the new United Kingdom's new national export success?
Yes, yes, that's what Johnny English, who is a glamorous, glamorous and incompetent, has earned his promise for another time. Even his name says above all that it is a collection of creatures directed at the world-speaking film market in English.
Of course, it's about the clever secret agent who is desperate to try to get around the spiritual glamor, but it appears as a mix of the inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and the unfortunate one-set musician at the London opening concert in 2012.
The figure is based on the fact that the cosmopolitan and the mysterious worldman Atkinson first presented in the forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard.
In fact, the last show has a moment.
I particularly liked the scene in which Johnny English arrived on a helicopter dressed as an medieval hammer, and the rotor's stage was knocking on his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy gifts appear, but the humor itself appears to be under-effective and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task today provide a sense of humor as part of the essential content of the film.
The sense of humor affects children, and I do not think that I am as clever and sharp as Atkinson's Mr. Bean's migro role as a comet of Mr. Bean's migro roles.
Every year, a repeated starting point is that the United Kingdom is in a worse situation than that of the United Kingdom.
The cyber hacker is infiltrated into the British top-class spy network and reveals the identity of all British agents in the field to be a member of the service – as presented by Kevin Eldon's unfortunate little role effort.
This is the last drop for the prime minister, who is already in his capacity as a political dissatisfaction: Emma Thompson does everything in the skins of Teresa May, but the script does not only provide him with sufficient space.
When the intelligence advisors inform him that all the spies in the field have been revealed, an emergency call must be made to someone who has already moved from active service to active service.
It is, of course, a skurovova Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement days as a teacher at a fine school, but at the same time he gives informal lessons in spying skills. The topic is amplifying some clever jokes; English keeps school of Rock-type lessons in intelligence halls.
English will be congratulated for the emergency meeting in Whitehall, where he will meet again his endlessly patient battle partner Bough, which will continue to be played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine who plays a role in Vicki Pepperdine's rights.
So the disasters of Batman and Robin have returned to his Majesty's secret service in order to meet the fateful super-crime Ophelia Bhuletova, Ophelia Bhuletoku.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is becoming a manipulating charismatic IT billionaire, and Jake Lacy's acting by Jason Volta claims he can solve the British computer problems.
The English and Bough odysse are about to turn into a farce: a twin made up of waitresses will light a fine French restaurant on fire and cause chaos in the attempt to hide the Vola luxury yachts. The company will be familiar with Volta's house with virtual glasses will end up with pure anarchy in the real world.
Even the last nights of the artists are running away from the final scene, but despite all the power and charm, the film still seems a little bit childish.
The film can be considered moderate.
As I watch Johnny English movies, I have come to the same thought at the same time: why is the British film industry in Britain unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent? Why is it unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The UK Labour Party disputes plans for a four-day working week at five-day salary.
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but the salary would be paid at five days a day.
The defence is reported to be demanding corporate leaders to transfer savings made by a means of a revolution to workers in an additional free-time form.
The plan is that employees could enjoy three days of weekends on the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea of a "sopi" party's economic programme and its plans to hug policies for the benefit of workers.
The Central Organisation of Trade Unions supports a four-day working week as a means for workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the High Level Labour Party reports to the newspaper Sunday Times: "The notice of revision of the complaint had been announced before the change in the year.
The change does not take place at the moment, but the four-day working week is an objective that fits the party's approach to balancing the economy for workers and the overall industrial strategy of the party."
The Labour Party is not the first party to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the four-day shift to work week during its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective shall not be to support in the context of the Laborin line.
The worker's informant notes: "The working week is not the party's orientation, and the party does not consider that transition."
Mr John McDonald, Minister for Finance of the shadow government, took advantage of the work conference held last week to present his vision of the economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to recover power from 'advanced dictators' and from 'traders' of companies of general interest.
According to the Minister of Finance of the Defence Government, current shareholders of water companies would not be able to recover their share in its entirety because the government led by Labour would be able to carry out "depleting" on the basis of the irregularities identified.
He also confirmed the plans to set up employees in business management and to set up in-depth equity funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to the management of employees. According to the plan, a single employee would be paid up to a maximum of 500 pounds a year in dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing in the 60-minute programme on whether or not the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The investigation of the prosecution of the FBI Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed at least one week the final vote on the appointment of Kavanaugh as the Supreme Court. The delay also raises the question as to whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican translators to the name Kavanaugh.
In the 60-minute period to be sent on Sunday, the correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out what might change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than a colleague from southern Carolina.
"Yes, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said by the time I heard... "I said I've been discussing with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charges came up, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Instead, Graham's voice looks like a stone cut.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's bombproof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett denied it strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasay Ford.
"No one of the people he named could confirm the matter.
It's about 36 years old.
I don't see what's really going to change."
What is Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Civil Festival, held in New York on Saturday, is a music event with a playing card as impressive as its mission: the removal of poverty from the world.
The seven-time Global Civil Festival attracts tens thousands of people to the lawns of the New York Central Park to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Civil Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation to the Global Energy Project, an international consultative group aimed at poverty eradication by increasing the number of people who are actively involved in poverty eradication.
In order to obtain a free ticket event (if it is not willing to pay the VIP flag) the public must carry out various tasks or "works", such as voluntary work, send an e-mail to the political end or make a call to the public, or perform any other action that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizen been successful, now that it is 12 years longer to reach the goal?
Is the idea of a free concert ticket a real way to persuade people to take action, or is it just one among the others ‘klikivism’ – the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a TV?
Since 2011, Global Citizen announced that it had registered over 19 million "actions" made on behalf of different objectives since 2011.
It says that these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to report commitments and principles that account for more than $37 billion and have been used in a way that affects more than 2.25 billion people's lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which over $10 billion have already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the resources achieved have already affected almost 649 million people worldwide by now.
The main commitments include, for example, the Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in the United Kingdom, which is committed to "help children develop their full potential". The group committed to deliver Rwanda 35 million dollars to the end of the malnutrition in the country. This happened after the activists had sent them 4 700 televisions following the Global Civil campaign.
Thanks to the British Government, donors, governments of different countries and just like you people of the world, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the magazines of history of social injustice and malnutrition," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition, to the audience at a concert held in London in 2018.
According to the group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by the power of more than 5,000 actions.
One of the questions on the website of the movement is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
Global civilian response: "It will be a long and difficult thing to do and there will be a lot of compulsive stones ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights fights and the movements against apartheid before us, because together we are stronger."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman are running a New York concert this year, and its map includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae.
According to the U.S. Department of Home Affairs, the country can make energy exports more difficult by using the fleet "predow" as a means of "predow".
According to the American Minister of the Interior, Ryan Zinke, Washington can rely "if necessary" on the assistance of its fleet to prevent the proliferation of Russian energy in the world markets, including the near futures.
Zinke claims that Russia's actions in Syria – called by the legal government – constitute an excuse for undermining the new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the cause of the presence of [Russia] in the Middle East is energy transmission, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," says Zinken.
According to the authorities, there are ways and means available to prevent this.
"The United States has the ability to keep ship routes open by means of its fleet and, where appropriate, by islanding it to ensure that the energy they provide does not enter the world market" he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, which is an unprofitable group, which is profiled as a "announcer of energy consumers" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this was one thing.
"Iran and Russia's economic option is more or less speculation, and replacement of fuel for another," he says, and describes Russia as "a single trick circus number", based on the economy of fossil fuels.
In the event of a situation where the Trump regime has sought to strengthen the export of liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace it with significantly more favourable Russian liquid natural gas.
In order to make this more effective, Trump's administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "efficiencies" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to President Trump, binds Berlin to Moscow's recovery path.
Moscow is a repeatedly weighted Nord Stream 2 pipeline project designed to double the transfer capacity of the existing tube of 110 billion cubic metres is a purely economic project.
The Kml claims that Washington's opposition has purely economic reasons behind it, and considers it to be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose its supplier" says Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has caused a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial roofing organisation in the country, the German Industry Federation, has called on the United States to keep separate from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"The fact that a third country is involved in our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, Director of the Federal Ministry of Germany, recently said German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, following the meeting of the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator Massachusetts of Senator Massachusetts, is planning to think carefully about the position under the presidential election 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020 2020
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts announced that he would be a presidential candidate after the election.
Warren confirmed that he was considering a call for proposals at an open questionnaire in Holly, Massachusetts, Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to move to Washington and correct our poor government, and this also means a woman at the head of the kingdom" he said according to The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I will give careful consideration to the position of the presidential candidate."
Warren estimated President Donald Trump at the occasion by saying, "It's going to take the country the wrong way".
"I worry about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," he says.
Warren has been directly critical of Trump and his highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren wrote, "Well, I guess we need an FBI study before we vote.
However, according to the opinion published on Thursday, the majority of Warren's voters are not in favour of this position in 2020.
According to the research carried out by Suffolk University Policy Research Institute and Boston Globe, 58% of 'probable' voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of the senator's position.
32% supported candidate status.
More of the respondents supported the position of former Governor Deval Patrick on condition of 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
For example, former Vice-President Joe Biden and President of Vermont are Bernie Sanders, who are among the most prominent democratic candidates for the 2020 elections.
According to the Associated Press News Office, Benen has stated that he/she has decided on his nomination officially by January.
Sarah Palin points to his son’s war trauma at Donald Trump’s election meeting in Donald Trump.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being recruited by the armed forces in September.
Track Pal was arrested on Monday night before Monday night, and he was charged with the charge of domestic violence.
"For what my own son has to go through after returning home I can well relate to other families who have to face the consequences and injuries of PTSD's return to our soldiers," he told the audience meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Donald Trump, at the Donald Trump election.
Palin called the arrest “the current horse in the living room” and said his son, as the other war veterans “stamped home a little while ago, they return with hardship, they return wondering whether they will respect what he and his fellows in the army and in the air powers have done for this country.”
On Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, the Commissioner Dan Bennett of Wasilla told us that he was charged with assault on domestic violence and violence against women, domestic violence and the treatment of murder and weapon abuse.
18 states and the Columbia Union support the application brought against a new asylum policy, which is raised against the new asylum policy.
Eighty states and the Columbia Federation are seeking a change to a new policy that has entered into force in the United States that asylum is not granted to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
The 18 state and federal representatives have lodged a letter of the right to friends in Washington on Friday. The letter supports policy-breaking asylum seekers, reports NBC News.
The full name of the owner has not been published in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions file, which the American Civil Liberties Union, in August, raised against the federal policy.
He tells his partner's "and his sons of violent gangs" have abused him, and the U.S. authorities have denied him asylum on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The public prosecutor, who supported Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, a large number of those who seek asylum from the United States, as countries where gang violence and family violence are a problem that has spread to all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy repealed the decision taken by the Board of Appeal on the basis of the family violence by 2014.
In its opinion on Friday, Karl Racine, the General Prosecutor of the Columbia Federal District, said that the new line "is ignored by the States, the Federal Federal and International Law for decades".
"The law of the State of origin requires all applications for asylum to be settled on the basis of facts and circumstances on the basis of which the application is made, and such an obstacle is an infringement of this principle" the letter says friends of the right.
The prosecutors also claim in the letter that the practical harm of the US economy is being undermined by the fact that the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they "have the necessary additional labour".
In June, General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions ordered judges on immigration to suspend the granting of asylum from the victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons who flee their own country of origin because of persecution or fear caused by race, religion, nationality or a particular class of society or political opinion", in its opinion of 11.6.
The place of refuge was never meant to solve all problems — even serious problems — that people face every day around the world.

"Tilanne is very tense", says a 35-year-old mother of Risa Kusuma, who is bored with her hot baby Please be decimated in an evacuation centre in a deserted city.
"The ambulances will give you a minute to bring new bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
The residents will return to their destroyed homes, pick up their watered goods and try to save what is still to be saved.

I was stuck in a wall of ruins, I guess." Harris says Associated Press and tells me that he and his family were wedding guests in the city.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then came silent.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they'll be safe."
The United States Ambassador blames China on "provosation" by "propagandas".
The Chinese Ambassador blames Beijing for using the American press as a propaganda tool. This happens a week after the Chinese newspaper has published in the US daily a four-page advertisement, which praises the mutual interests of the trade agreement between the United States and China.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the item in Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the State of Iowa, accused of interference with the Congress elections held on 6 November. China has denied claims.
According to the U.S. authorities who spoke to Reuters, the Trump's accusations against Beijing's attempts to interfere with the US elections mean a new stage in the Washington enlarged campaign to put China on pressure.
While it is normal for a foreign government to issue notices to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently entrenched into a always escalating trade war, where both parties impose, in turn, duties on the counterparty's export products.
According to Chinese and American experts, China's revenge tariffs were directed at states such as Iowa that supported the Trump Republic Party at the beginning of the war.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and long-term governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the US labour force, to farmers and to businesses. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China "is now speeding up its provocations by publishing propaganda in our own free press" wrote Branstad in its opinion report published in Des Moines Register on Sunday's Des Moines.
"By ending its propaganda, the Chinese Government will benefit from the most appreciated tradition of the US free word and press by setting up a paid notification to Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
However, the different opinions in the Peking Streets are only limited, and real, distinct opinions that Chinese citizens may have from the alarming development of their economy can not be seen at all. This is because the media is strictly in the middle of the Chinese Communist party, he writes.
Branstad will continue by saying that "one of the largest newspapers in China has recently published the offer" article he wrote, but not to specify what it is about.
Kavanaugh-fiasko deportes female voters from Republican Republican Republicans, analysts warn against being warned by analysts.
The fact that many of the Republican tops stand behind and defends the Supreme Court's Judge-Rapporteur Brett Kavanaugh, according to analysts, may give rise to a reaction, particularly in the context of the forthcoming elections between women's voters.
The feelings surrounding the event have been on large rounds, and most Republicans have already announced their wish to vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," says Professor Grant Reeher, professor of State Studies, from the Maxwell Institute at the University of Syracus, The Hill, published on Saturday in an article published in The Hill magazine.
Reeher does not believe the last moment's offer by Senator Jeff Flake (Republicans, Arizona) is to keep angry voters from the FBI investigation.
"Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, Senior Counselor, and the National Reform Group's informant of MoveOn Friday, according to the newspaper of the capital city.
On Friday morning, the protestors sang "November" by showing their opinion on the Senate's corridors when the ruling of the ruling Republicans of the Legal Affairs Committee to proceed to the term of Kavanaugh, which happened despite Dr. Christine Blasay Ford's statement of assurance, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable", says Stu Rotheenberg, an uncommitted political analyst in the interview with the website.
"The people say that enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, especially, in the case of the nearby, insecure female voters and older voters, between 18 and 29 years of age, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts foresee possible counter-reaction if Republicans are making progress with confirmation even before Ford's testimony against the candidate for the Supreme Court in which it claimed sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the National Committee for Republican National Committee, to the NBC News news channel at the beginning of last week.
"This is not just about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is to be called into question, and it is about how Republicans have worked and how they have been treated by Fordia", Guy Cecil, the leader of the Group of the Progressives Group of the United States of America, which supported Democrats, pointed to the news.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided into whether they should believe in Ford or Kavanaugh's testimony as a small majority are inclined to the latter.
According to the new opinion made by YouGo, 41% of respondents believe that Ford's witness statement is absolutely or likely, whereas 35% say that they believe in Kavanaugh or are likely to believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh is likely or definitely lying in his witness statement, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
The FBI is investigating Ford, and at least one more of the charges of Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reporting.
Ford witnessed in front of the Committee on Legal Affairs under oath Kavanaugh, worrying about him when Ford was 17 years old when he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that even the Supreme Court candidate for the Supreme Court has revealed to him at a student party of his family while they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web’s inventeder World Wide Web is planning to begin a new Internet as a counter to Google and Facebook to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, an invention of World Wide Web, has started a start-up company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technology legend, Ingroup, is a company based on the Berners-Leen open source for Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to any information.
At the Fast Company interview, Berners-Lee is joking by Inrut's purpose is to "the rule of the world".
"It has to be done now," he said to his starter, referring to his start-up attempt.
"This is an historic moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal database", i.e. POD.
It may contain contact information lists, records, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all available in one browser at the same time.
The unique nature of the personal database is that it is completely user- closed to who has access to which type of data.
The company calls it "the personal entry into force of the data".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inupt is to give resources, processes and required skills to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently consists of a safety platform purchased by Berners-Leen, Brucen, IBM, some hired developers working with the project and a community of voluntary coders.
Technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralised applications with tools available on the Inrupt website. This is all available from this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team will not discuss "Facebook and Google about whether people will be offered a complete change in which all their business models will be translated into their main stage one night".
"We don't ask their consent to the matter."
In its article, Berners-Lee, published on Saturday, wrote Inrupt "the task of providing commercial energy and ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built for Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee muleisted the Internet by setting up the World Wide Web consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology University.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a powerful role in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as founder and leader of World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institutes also after the launch of Inupti.
"I am extremely optimistic about the next period of time, looking at" Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers the hero priest of World War First World War II.
The city celebrates the only priest who has been awarded the Victoria Cross medal in England as a soldier after 100 years of events have taken place.
It was awarded to the Colonel, Pastor Bernard Vann, on 29 September 1918, following the events of the attack on the villages of Bellellis and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, the bath died of an observer, without ever knowing of the highest British military tribute he had ever received.
Two of his grandchildren were exposing the monumental stone in Rushen, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is "a impressive symbolic"; the monument was revealed exactly 100 years after his awarded grandfather's occupation.
According to London Gatette 29 9.1918, Colonel Vun led his Battalion to the Canal de Saint-Quent over "in a very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field guns and machine guns."
Later on, he rushed into the front line and "the greatest bravery" led the troops to progress before he ran into a single field gun. In the following battle, Van lost his own hands with three cannon batteries soldiers.
Colonel Vann died of a German observer on 4 October 18 – only a month before the war ended.
Michael Vun, 72, said his grandfather's act was "some one I could never achieve, something that stimulates respect".
Michael Vann He gave his brother Dr. James Van a fight after a parade by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band orchestra.
Michael Vann says it's "a great honor to take part in the parade" and added, "a great crowd is remembering the glory of a genuine hero."
The friends of the free match were waiting up all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the TV channel looked like Pipsa Possua.
Imagine a situation where you have been up all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the whole event as a presentation.
There were 13 matches in the Sanessa Event Programme, of which six main series matches, and the show was intended to present a direct broadcast on Channel 5 channel in Britain.
In the morning, just as Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the round the program changed into a great strain for the viewers of Pipsa Possu.
Some of the viewers were not really happy when they stayed up all night for a fight.
On Twitter, one of the friends of the holiday game opened up to replace a match with children's drawing "a kind of sick joke".
"The law said that this content was not appropriate to be presented at 6 a.m., so they had to change it to a children's programme" explained Dave Schwartz, Senior Marketing and Communication Manager of Bellator's Senior Marketing and Communication Programme".
"Pipsa Possu, yes".
Scott Coker, director of Bellator Company, said that timetables will be worked so that UK viewers can monitor events in the future.
"I'm thinking about the re-transmission that's probably gonna make the program work", Coker said.
"But it is six in the morning and we cannot present the programme until Sunday before our time, which in turn is their time on Monday.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed into their head, the messages began to go in the direction and in the other direction, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to correct the mistake because we thought it was a technical problem.
This was not the case, however, but it was a legislative matter.
I promise you this will not happen the next time.
We limit the number of matches to five in six places, as usual. We tried to offer more to our fans and we tried too much.
This is a bad situation."
Desert Island Disscs: Tom Daley felt under-representing himself for his sexual reasons.
A swim jumper and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells us that he feels inferior to everyone else because of his sexual nature, but this, however, motivates him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he's only discovered when he came to high school that "all are not the same as me.
Lauren Laverne, who was talking about gay rights in the Radio 4 Channel Desert Island Discs program, tells me that Dale has spoken about the rights of gays to give others a ‘ hope’.
He also tells us how it was no longer so important to win the Olympic Games after having a child.
The long-term radio programme’s regular planner Kristy Young has taken several months off due to the disease.
As a guest in Laverne's first program, Dale told me that he felt younger than everyone else, because "it was not socially acceptable to think of boys and work".
He says: "To this day these emotions, feel smaller and different have been reality, and they have given me the strength and energy I have needed to succeed."
He says he wants to show that he is 'some' so that he does not disappoint everyone when his sexuality finally becomes revealed.
The double Olympic Prominist has become a high profile LGBT activist, and he is present at this year's community competitions in calling for the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came out because he felt lucky to be able to live transparently without consequences and wanted to give ‘ hope’ to other people.
The triple world champion tells of his falling in love with a man — an American filmmaker, Dust Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - “a surprise.”
Dale got married to this thing for 20 years with an older Oscar winner last year, but says that age difference has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things as young", he attended his first Olympics when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later – "it is difficult to find another age who would have experienced similar side and counter-attacks", Dale says.
The couple received a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – which has changed the "total perspective" of Dale.
"If you'd asked me last year, my life would have run around winning a gold medal," he says.
"You know, there are bigger things than each Olympic Memorial.
Robbie is my Olympic Olympic Games."
His son was named after Dale's father who died in 2011 when he was only 40 years old for brain cancer.
Dale said that his father never accepted the fact that he would die, and one of the last things he asked him about were the entry tickets for the 2012 Olympic Games.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't be here anymore to be in the front yard", Dale says.
"I kept her hand when her breathing stopped. Only after she had really stopped breathing and she was dead, I realized that she was not vulnerable," she says.
The following year, Dale competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the dance.
"I knew this was something that I've dreamed of my whole life – jump in front of the audience in the Olympics. There's no better feeling", Dale says.
This was also an inspiration for his first copy of the program – Heather Model's paragraph "Proud" – that woke up feelings when he was preparing for the Olympics, and who still gets his skin for chicken meat.
Desert Island Disks are sent to BBC Radio on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
The popular Mickelson change bench for Mickelson in Ryder Cup Saturday Saturday at the Ryder Cup on Saturday at the Ryder Cup on Saturday at the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday by playing his 47th Ryder Cup tour, but he must be swept away significantly in order to avoid a record tour remaining in history as an unhappy performance.
Mickelson, who is playing in the event played every two years for a record 12 times, moved to a swap bench by Captain Jim Furyk during Saturday's play for the funball and the funsum.
A mostly central American five-time Major tournament winner now spent half of the day as a cheerleader and on the other side of the field trying to get control of his shot.
A 48-year-old Mickelson, who was not even considered to be one of the most accurate drivers at the top of his career, is not an ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-sized bear punishs inaccurate hits.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson himself, the 9th game on Sunday has a precise reputation as the British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who is playing together with the incoming Tommy Fleetwood, whose goal is to set up the four winning tube here this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12 doubles when they come in, get a flying departure, the Michelson game can prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his trust in his player, but what else could be said about the situation?
"He fully understands the role he played today. He killed me in the back, routine and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He often has confidence in himself.
He's no doubt part of the best players and has brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I've imagined something else, but this is how it went, and we've come to a decision like this.
He wants to be on that field as much as anyone else."
Mickelson's breaking Nick Faldon's record of several played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It may also mark the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halfs, but Furyk says that his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's a funny, sarcastic, clever, like a joke at people's expense, and he's a funny guy who everybody likes," he explains.
"The younger players must have had fun with him this week. It must be fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than just a mere bet in the game."
Captain Thomas Bjoorn of the European team knows how long leadership may quickly disappear quickly as soon as the long leadership of the European team can disappear fast fast as the long lead lead can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, Captain of the European Team, is aware of the experience of the fact that before the last day's two-games, you can come a short journey.
In 1997, a Danish player made his debut in Valderama, where on the side of Seve Ballesteros, he had a five-point lead in front of the Americans, but who was able to win the winner with a little bit of his nose and won with the highest possible margin141⁄2-1311⁄2.
"It reminds us of ourselves how we were running in Valderama in Valderama, we ran a hole in Brookline where we were lost, but we won Valderama, although scarcely," said Bjorn after looking at the 5-3-3 winners of the 2018 team both Friday and yesterday on the 10–6-rolling Le Golf National.
History will show both to me and to all other members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot a big caliber.
We'll go to the airport and do everything right.
The game is not over until the numbers are on the table.
We have a goal, we're trying to win that prize, and we're only aiming for it.
As I have always said, I focus on these 12 players who are playing our side. However, we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world."
I'm glad his team's players have been through a difficult field, Bjorn adds: "I'll never be licked before I fall for such things.
Tomorrow is completely different.
The first priority tomorrow is individual performance, and then we will talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be on the ground with a partner when everything goes well, but when the field is alone, the player's capacity will be tested to the bottom.
This is a message that needs to be transmitted to players – tomorrow everyone will be able to do the best they can.
Now we have to give up the partner who can also go [to the outside alone] and do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite Captain Jim Furyk comes with a better performance of his players as individuals than they could as partners. By way of derogation from this, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk has experienced the last day's full translations in both directions. He was involved in the team he won in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when the European team won by "The Medina's miracle".
"I remind every word of the devil", he answered the question about how Captain Ben Crenshaw handed out the lines of his team to last day's encounters.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like happened in Brookline, or like what happened in Medinah.
When it comes to moving things in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on middle games.
We have adjusted our composition accordingly and put the boys on the field as we want, as you know, we are going to do miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defence fight and he is faced with the most important game. Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are facing their next European opponents.
"I gave up the group's guys in this order because I think it's going to carry through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his choice of double games.
Again again again again again again again again again the German new German German war fleet will be delayed by the German new German war fleet.
The new German fleet should have been introduced in 2014. The purpose of the vessel was to replace the fleet during the ageing Cold War, but it will be introduced at the earliest next year due to poor systems and explosive costs, reporting the local media.
According to the military reporter on the Die Zeit magazine, the introduction of ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’, the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg group has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The vessel was to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying after-delivery problems have been persecutiond by an ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class frequency.
According to the available data, they are equipped with effective cannons, missile systems to combat aircraft and surface ships, as well as alarm technology, such as radar reflectivity and technology to reduce the lightness of infrared and acoustic signals.
The essential characteristics of the vessel also include its longer range of maintenance – new fregettes should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without going to their port of residence.
However, continuous delays mean that warships representing the top of technology, which are intended to improve Germany's influence in the overseas regions, are already obsolete at the time when they enter the service, Die Zeit notes.
The poor F125 franc ended up in the headlines last year when the German fleet officially refused to take up the ship and returned it to the yard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time that the fleet returns the vessel after its delivery.
We know little about the reasons for the return, but Germany's media has talked about the essential "software and equipment errors" that make the warship an inappropriate battle function.
Software deficiencies are of particular importance because the size of the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ships is about 120, which is only half of the crew of the older Bremen class fregettes.
It also showed that the vessel is highly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's ability to further upgrades.
Rheinland-Pfalz, a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is expected to be twice as heavy as the corresponding class ships used in the Second World War in Germany.
In addition to dirty equipment, the price tag for the whole project is also developing a problem.
The price is estimated to be up to EUR 3.1 billion, with the original price of EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems with the introduction of new fregattes have emerged since the German Navy has recently been warned of shrinking.
Hans- Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee of the German Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's usable vessels "are running low".
According to the Authority, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been removed, but no new ones have been submitted to them.
He complained that any Baden-Württemberg class frigate could not have been introduced into the fleet.
The organisation of the Environment is listening to the secret life of widows.
A new survey in the area above Scotland will seek to find out how bats make use of the ground when hunting food.
The new research is expected to bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and to guide future protection measures.
A survey by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland has been conducted to monitor the mutilation and midwives packages, as well as the larvae and water pebbles in the area of Inverewe Garden, Wester Ross, the veterinary garden in the area of Inverewe Garden.
The study will set up specific storage equipment to monitor the operation of bats in the region during the season.
The staff and volunteers of the organisation shall also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the alarming and the nature of which it is all about, will be ensured by the analysis of experts.
Based on the results, an environment map and a report will be established where bat behaviour can be presented in an appropriate picture of the area’s scale.
Rob Dewar, the organization's natural conservation advisor hopes that the results will reveal which habitat areas are the most important for bats, and how different species use them.
Information is useful for the design of the habitats area, such as the creation of wetlands and the management of forest areas in such a way as to take account of bats and associated species into account.
The population in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have fallen significantly over the last hundred years.
Building and building work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and whales can also present a risk, such as flypapers and certain chemicals used in building materials as well as attacks by pet chips.
In fact, cigarettes are not blind.
Due to the nightly hunting methods, however, their ears will be of greater benefit to catches in fishing than their eyes.
In order to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path, bats are using advanced well-being techniques.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organisation focused on the protection of rural environment, which maintains more than 270 historical buildings, 38 significant gardens and 77,000 hectares across the country – and they take the rests seriously.
It has ten experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspections of rest places and, in some cases, also animal rescue measures.
The organisation has even established the first and only bat protection zone for the three countries of the territory of the Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, the first and only one of the countries in question.
According to local administrator David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threeve is very well suited for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and a good environment overall.
We do not yet know everything about bats, so our work here and in other organisational areas will help us to understand better what bats need in order to succeed."
He stresses the importance of reviewing the buildings for bats before taking up rehabilitation, as destroying a single resting place of bats can unintentionally cause up to 400 female pigs and the death of a boy and destroys the entire local population.
Leaks are protected animals and their killing, interference or destruction is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the widow protection organization, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have much to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronalddo disputes rape charges while lawyers prepare a case against the German magazine against the German magazine against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been stamped against him by the rape charges against him as "false" and says that people want to "pire themselves" by his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action on the claims of the public German newspaper Der Spiegel to challenge the court.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a lavegasi hotel in 2009.
He claims to have paid the victim $375 000 for silent treatment, Der Spiegel reports on Friday.
Ronaldo appeared only to his 142 million successors in the Instagram mission after the claim. A 33-year-old football player rejected the accusations strongly and described them as "an exposure".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to advertise themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, it belongs to this profession.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," the player kept smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to challenge Der Spiegel for the claims that they have called the Reuters News Office "inadequate reporting of doubts within the scope of privacy protection".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player requires compensation for "permanent suffering according to the seriousness of the infringement, which means probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayorgan are told that they met at the night club and moved to the player's room where he is claimed to have raped this anally, according to the documents submitted to the Regional Court of Nevada Clark County.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldon landed on his knees after the alleged event and reported that he was a 99% good guy, but whose "one percent" was disappointing.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that a couple had sex, but it was a mutual agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she visited the police station and took photos of her injuries at the hospital, but later she ended up with a settlement because she was "happy of the possibility of revenge" and she was concerned "to be the subject of public humility."
The 34-year-old says now that he is seeking the annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatised by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault from Manchester United, and moved to the Italian power team to Juventure with a $100 million agreement.
Brext: United Kingdom "you would regret forever" car manufacturing ending.
The United Kingdom would be "exceeding forever" if it lost its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the break, Minister Greg Clark said.
He added to his view as 'maintenance' the notification by the UK Department of Tokyo to temporarily suspend production in his factory near Derby, Burnston, in his factory near Derby, if the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the effect of limitation is visible as job losses if brexitti is concluded without a contract.
A factory in Burnaston, which produces the Auris and Avenida models of Tokyo, produced nearly 150 000 cars last year. Of these 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that if Britain suddenly withdraws from the EU at the end of March, our production will be interrupted," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Danube Burnaston unit of Tokyo.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about the European Union's liberalisation in how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW has announced that it will close its factory for Mini for a month in the implementation of the Brexite.
The most important concern is, according to the driver's report, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of the execution of the non-contractual brexite.
The Kyoto production line is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers from Britain and the EU, and cars are manufactured from the order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may cause disturbances at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and difficulties in parts of the EU.
Keeping a permanent warehouse for more than 24 days at Derbyshire plant is impossible according to Tokyo, and production would be stopped.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is "an precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that does not merely mean success in the current situation, but it is an opportunity that we must take advantage of," he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today's programme.
"Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers' opinions show that we absolutely need to be able to continue with the series of very well-functioned supply chains."
Toyo cannot tell us how long the production would be stopped, but warn us that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the installation and ultimately cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallain, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and has worked as a trade union operator at the factory, says a concern among growing members: "The jobs lost according to my experience will never return.
The government editor says: "We must present a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announced that the White House would inform the White House of the fact that the latest meeting with Roseninstein might be delayed again.
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be "to be transferred to another week" to the Supreme Court's judge, Brett Kavanaugh, because of the obligation of debt, the White House announced on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn investigates Russia's interference with the elections, the links of Trump's assistants with Russia and the President in order to prevent any legal action that may be taken by Russia and the President.
In Washington, there has been a rumor for months about the Trump's intention to separate the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the neutrality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, New York Times report to Rosenstein about the possibility of recording discussions with Trump, as well as the possibility for the President to resign on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting is to report that Rosenstein resigned from office.
However, President Trump was at that time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he "not preferably" would separate Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed because that time was brought together with the consultation of the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who was responsible for him, Dr Christine Blasay Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday Trump ordered the Bureau's long-term investigation against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote on the Senate plenary session.
The Trump press manager, Sarah Sanders, was performing on Fox News Sunday.
As Sanders said: "The final amount for this is not set. It could be next week, this week, it can be delayed by one more week, because of everything else, because of the highest court is currently under way.
However, I always want to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists might disagree on this argument: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Newsman Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders says, however, that "I do not deny the fact that they are being taken into account" because of the lack of reason for press conferences.
However, Sanders indicated that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The President will hold more questions than any president before him", he says, and more evidence without mentioning, "We've checked those numbers."
"The press events are still being organised", Sanders said, but "it is extremely much better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss with me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do this several times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly with the President of the United States."
Trump will answer questions on a regular basis when visiting the White House or participating in open events or press conferences with visiting valuables.
The performance alone at the press conference is rare.
This week in New York, the President may have shown a reason for this in the event of an unprecedented and time for the strangely present journalists.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter on the fears of brexith among workers from EU countries from Scotland's Public Health System (NHS Scotland) concerning the fear of brexitine for workers from Scotland's EU countries.
The Minister for Health has written a letter to workers from EU countries in Scotland in order to express their gratitude and wish them to remain in the country after the break.
The Scottish Member, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter when the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU is less than six months away.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs that will be incurred by EU citizens working in specialised public services for 'sec status' applications.
In his letter, Freeman writes as follows: During the summer of the break-up negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued towards the coming autumn decisions.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up preparations for possible non-contractual differences.
I know that for all of you these are uncertain times.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we appreciate each of our employees' contribution to citizenship without regard to nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombe due to an emergency injury caused by the head injury caused by the head injury caused by Christation Abercrombe in the event of an emergency.
Christio Abercrombie, a supporter of Tennessee State Tigers team, has been in an emergency since the team had been destroyed 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reported to Tennessee supplier Mike Organ.
Chief Coach Rod Reed of Tennessee State told the journalists that the injury had occurred just before the halftime.
"He came on the sidelines and simply fell into it," Reed says.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombus oxygen on the sideline before they put him on pairs and took him to the side for a more detailed assessment.
Tennessee State's operator told WSMV channel editor Chris Harrisille Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has had an operation in Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/quality of damage at this stage", and that Tennessee State was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercromie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays first through his team after his transfer from Illinois.
He had five jackets on Saturday before leaving the game, which totals 18 jackets this season.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax when they buy properties in the United Kingdom.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax on their purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. Extra money will be used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The purpose of the amendment is to neutralize Corby's success in attracting young voters to attract young voters.
The raising of the stamp duty concerns those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to GBP 120 million per year – to help homeless people.
Theresa May is coming to inform foreign buyers today about the higher stamp tax on foreign buyers when they buy properties in the UK. The extra money is used to help homeless people.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and paid attention to good income taxation.
The increase in stamp duty is directed at people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom, and the extra money from this is directed by the government to facilitate the plight of homeless people.
The additional charge, which is added to the current stamp tax, in addition to the second housing and investment housing increases added two years ago, may be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an annual increase of up to 120 million pounds.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of London's news buildings are bought by residents other than the United Kingdom on a permanent basis, which increases prices and makes it difficult for first-hand buyers to access the property market.
Many wealthy regions in the United Kingdom, especially in its capital, have become ‘near cities’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
A new line will only come weeks after Boris Johnson presented a stamp tax reduction as a means of facilitating the purchase of young people's first housing.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices of real estate prices high by buying and leaving it unconstructed, and asked Prime Minister Mayy to abandon the quotas for affordable housing in order to correct the "marital situation" of British housing.
Corby has published a significant series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the end of the 'cenship decisions'.
He would also like to give the council more power in matters related to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I said last year I am going to have my Prime Minister's dream of restoring my British dream — that every generation's life should be better than its predecessors.
This means correcting our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right for people who do not live in the United Kingdom and companies located abroad to buy housing as easily as those who live in hard Britain.
Too many people who own a home have become too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a fact."
Jack: "My primary objective is the leadership of Scotland's national team."
Underland's leader, Jack Ross says his "perceptive goal" is to become the headmaster of the Scottish team at some point in time.
The 42-year-old Scottish is excited about the challenge of raising the country's first corner of the home team back on its feet. The team is currently in a third position in the UK second division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to Scotland's election last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play with my country team.
I got to the second team and it was there," Ross says in his BBC: Scotland's Sportsound broadcast.
“As a child, I often watched with my father Scotland games with Hampden, and it’s something that has always pulled me back.
The opportunity will only be received if I succeed as a manager of the association of success".
Ross' predecessors include Dick Advocate, David Moyas, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Head of Allo Athletic says that there was no concern about entering the boots of his prominent predecessors in a nominal association, and he has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"In the meantime, my own success is the fact that I can return this association to the election hall.
On the basis of the structure and ability of the Society, it undoubtedly belongs to the dial of the Society," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably think I'd be successful only if I could trust the team back to the election."
Ross has worked as a manager for only three years: first as assistant director of Dumbarton and then for 15 months thereafter, in the Hekss coach group.
After this, he helped Allo to rise from the fall of the third series and raised St Mirren from the fall class to master during the next season.
Ross says he's feeling better now than ever during his player career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic Teams.
"I was probably on a road trip with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to the direction of Allola.
"I believed that I was better suited to be manager than to be a player.
That sounds strange because I played well, made a little bit of money, and I was able to enjoy some relatively great successes.
However, playing can be tough.
The player has to deal with a variety of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but running the team seems exactly the right task to do.
I always wanted to lead the team, and now I'm doing my job, and I feel better in my own body than ever in my adult life.
The entire interview is scheduled to be held on Sunday 3:30 a.m. on Sunday, 9 a.m. Radio Scotland at 12 a.m. and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time to enjoy the chair is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m., the study shows that it is shown.
The heat wave of the summer has fired the pubs fighting with the difficulties of Britain, but at the same time increased the pressure on the food chain.
According to statistics, the sales of pubs and bar chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the output of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
The figures from Peter Martin business consultant CGA say: "CGA continued sunny weatheres and the expected longer participation of England in football World Championships meant that in July, a sales of pubs like June was 2.8% higher than in June, whereas a month was worse than in restaurants.
The June fall of 1.8% in the sale of restaurants only deteriorated in July.
Their sales of like-for-like increased more than the decrease in the sales of restaurants.
The warmly concentrated pubs also suffer from brightness, but less dramaticly than the restaurants' wheels.
It seems that people just wanted to get out of their minds.
The sales of pubs and bars rounded up by companies increased by 6.6% over the month, and the sales of feeds had a 3 percent reduction."
Paul Newman of the RSM company providing leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services, says: "The results continue with the trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the main factors for the sale of the external food market.
It is no surprise that the struggle for the food chain continues, although the fall in annual sales of 4.8% will increase particularly now that the sector is currently fighting with cost pressures.
A long hot summer could not have come to operators who were focused on eating the worse sauna, and only time would it seem to me that the life-old leaner temperatures of the industry would have been the quick-needed rest of breath.
The total increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new opened restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the formation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer for sales in the UK's pub, bar and restaurant sectors, which collects and analyses results in 47 fields of competence from a group whose aggregate turnover is more than 9 billion pounds. It is considered a reliable measure in the sector.
The fifth of children are secretly hiding social media accounts from their parents.
A fifth of children — some up to 11 years of age — hide social media accounts from their parents and teachers, says a study.
A survey of 20,000 students from higher education revealed the existence of a growing phenomenon ‘Instagram cross-linked accounts’.

One mother found messages from teenage writing, in which she hoped she would be raped after encountering her 13-year-old daughter on a secret site.
In a study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Rôterian Conference (HMC), it was found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted that they would hold secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up networks where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle says "Socococtian athletes' voice" from Eilidh Doyle "The Sound of athletes" to the Government of Scottish athletes Government of Scotland.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected as an independent member of the Government of Scotland, who is taking part in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most prized public athlete in Scotland. The President of the Government, Ian Beattie, describes the name as an excellent opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive international experience gathered by the athlete over the last decade.
"Emilidii is greatly respected with athletes in Scotland, the United Kingdom and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would greatly benefit from his appointment to the Government", Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as a sports player and I hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."

He wrote on Twitter, "A month ago, I got a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctor, time only shows me whether I'm gonna recover and what I'm gonna be okay with.
This has been a exhausting job, but I've recovered completely, learned to walk again, and now I'm training for agileness.
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Women's cow-like ads share opinions online.
The breast pump-making company's breast-feeding mothers in a commercial like dairy cows has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who makes consumer technologies, has introduced a product called "the world's first silent and wearable breast pump". Its marketing is accelerated by a language-based advertising, which describes the freedom of the new pump to breast-feeding mothers.
The mother of four real life dances in a hay filled the next song, saying, "Yes, I'm a little bit of a self, but I don't see her" and "if you didn't see her, they're not a ureches, they're a tits".
"Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, milk my findings."
However, advertising published on the company's Facebook page gave rise to a debate online.
A video that collected 77 000 views and hundreds of comments has raised conflicting reactions to viewers. Many people say it's making a joke about daily ‘fears’ in the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, but they will soon be stolen from them after delivery", one commentor writes.

Another viewer commented: "I understand that it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why couldn't they be used to advertise breast pump to mothers who can keep their baby?"
The third commenter added: "A totally realistic advertisement."
Advertising also gave me defenders: a woman admitted that the advertisement was "shit" to her.
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
Sneaking made me feel like a cow.
Advertising's a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
This is a brilliant product," reads one of the comments together.
Another viewer’s comment: “This is a fun ad that is directed at mothers who pump (most in the workplace or in the toilets) and ‘known themselves as cows’.
It is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the commercial, video women reveal that they have danced in observable pumps on their bras in the Istows.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
Elvie pump, on the other hand, is totally silent, has no leads and hoses, and it is clearly suitable for ingestion tapes, giving women freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, the shareholder and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office commented: "Elvie pump is a revolutionary product that earned a bold and provocative income market.
By crossover the breast-feeding mothers and dairys we wanted to bring all the challenges of using the breast pump into the light, we brought the feeling of incredible freedom brought forth by the new pump in a entertaining and similar way."
Elvie pump has ended up in the headlines before.
In London fashions, the mother of two children appeared on catwalk with designer Marta Jakubowski using a product in the name of designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children have been transferred to a tent camp on the Texas border border, Texas, in all silence.
However, despite the fact that the monthly number of cross-border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, this is due to the fact that, as a result of the rough rhetoric and policy taken by the Trump regime, children’s placement in foster family members has become difficult.
Most of the residents are traditionally composed of undocumented migrants, and registration as a resident may endanger their residence in the country of residence.
The risk increased in June, when the federal authorities announced that members of potential family members and other adult economy adults had to give fingerprints and that this information would be shared with the admission authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level entry and customs authority, witnessed last week in Congress that the Agency arrested dozens of people who had been applying for their residence as residents of minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of the arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Absolutely 80% of the people who are either members of their registered family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So we keep looking for these people," says Albence.
In order to address child cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules according to which, in some cases, the case has to be dealt with in court within a month instead of the 60-day time limit previously used, the employees of the reception centre report.
Many people would rather be present through a videoconferencing rather than personally driving their case before the Court of Justice on the issue of immigrants.
Those who are not considered entitled to be eligible for assistance are quickly deported.
According to the reports published in recent months by the employees of the reception centres and the system, the time spent in children's prison is affecting whether children are beginning to suffer anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent landings or forced attempts.
According to the lawyers, concerns are particularly highlighted in larger institutions, such as the Tornillo, where signs of child despair can be ignored, because of the large size of the establishment.
They increase the fact that children are transferred to tent cities without giving them sufficient time to prepare themselves for it emotionally or to say good-bye friends can cause trauma, and that many children are already suffering trauma at the moment.
Syria is ordered by the United States, France and Turkey's 'mansing forces' to leave immediately immediately immediately.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moualem, also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign troops are illegally in the country using the excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that "they will be with him to act accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and beyond, and in which millions of people have been forced to escape their homes.
He said Damascus would continue the "holy fight until the whole Syria has been cleared" of both terrorist organisations and "the illegal foreign troops".
The United States has about 2 000 soldiers located in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurds and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has placed battles to tear down more than 1 000 soldiers' division.
With regard to the refugee issue, Moualem said that the conditions were good for returning and accused 'some Western countries' of spreading 'irural fears', which encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have invited the international community and the NGOs to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They're talking about something that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be granted to Syria before the end of the war has been agreed by political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created the opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The Treaty between Russia and Turkey has prevented Russia from supporting a large-scale attack by Syrian troops on the territory of three million people.
Moualem has, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the wish that military action would be directed by jihadists, including Al-Nusra-related Al-Nusra's front fighters, "that will be destroyed".
The UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes that he will soon be able to invite a meeting of the new government and the opposition committee to meet in order to create a draft post-war Syrian constitution and improve the way for elections.
Moualem laid down the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, saying that its work should be limited to "checking the paragraphs of the current Constitution" and warned against interference with the matter.
Why does Trump become selected for another season? Why does Trump become selected for another season?
In accordance with this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 elections unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to wish, take office and scandal to decide his presidency early.
This would undoubtedly be the "dramatic presidential decision never"!
To date, no signs of fatigue have been observed in viewers.

The chaos has a value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike other TV programs, news from Washington can determine how the Roe vs. Wade thing happens, whether immigrant families can get to each other and how the world economy can be.
Inevitability is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond the citizen's obligations to exclude six hours of expert panels that claim to use Bob Woodward's source data to book the book for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15 000 sturtin-like pilot act (Washington Post says "intelligence of clothing") and Stormy Daniels's president, Mr. Trump's, of the consequences of the unfurnished anatomical descriptions of the Anatomical Descriptions of Trump's Anatomy.

I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, with him on the Far East coast was a wonderful day, but he couldn't go out because he was looking at MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He could not separate himself from a program in which Brett Kavanaugh was in front of the Senate Ombudsman's Committee on Legal Affairs and was the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember doing all those crazy programs and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right."

On the outside, money flows money tightly onto the middle side of the field.
It is not surprising that the 17th districts of Pennsylvania have faced a real cash flow, as, due to the reorganization of the congressional districts, two already elected candidates have to fight for one place.
This recently re-developed Electoral district of Pittsburgh is a battle for the democratic Conor Lamb, which was found true of the second district of the last spring in special elections.
Lamb will race with the second elected candidate, Keith Rothfus, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is currently represented by the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is across the board with the new 17th district.
The regional division was redeployed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old district division would favour the Republican against the Constitution.
Competition in the new 17th district has been launched in the financial departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The Lamb's name was introduced to Pennsylvania after the special elections of the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The place had been Republican for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won the region by 20%.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a fine advantage.
The United United States planned punishment for El Salvador because of its support for China, but it withdrew its intention to withdraw its intention to support El Salvador because of its support for China.
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already listed the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction to Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners deported the Trump Organisation Group's management team.
The U.S. officials decided to call back the American diplomatic leaders from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of the slow instructions that Taiwan was no longer recognised", said Heather Nauert, the department's editor, in his opinion earlier this month.
However, the penalties were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $ 140 million grant from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been severely hit by a state in Central America with high levels of unemployment and mental crime.
As internal meetings reached, the North and Central American authorities delayed the high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity. Last year's corresponding meeting was seen as a step in companies to prevent migrants from seeking to the United States.
However, in mid-September, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting was intended to progress and that it effectively decided on speculations for possible punishment of El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pencen is now expected to give a signal to the mid-October meeting of some kind of importance for the meeting of the Governing Body, the diplomats said.
These three American ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new age messages or penalties from Washington.
The editor of the White House of Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate with three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs with anonymously.
Their analysis confirmed the external analyst near the administration, who also talked about the protection of anonymity condition.
History teaches lessons
The next inevitable step may be the report by Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of justice by President Trump, who now has very serious evidence in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to conduct an investigation into whether the Trump campaign will work in co-operation with Russia when Russia involved in the US elections.
If the power changes in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just when preparing to go again before its voters and, if possible, to condemn their likeness.
This is a lot of dissatisfaction, and I don't mean to say that President Trump's defeat is inevitable, even more than the loss of the defendants in Europe.
We have to make solutions on both sides of the Atlantic, and these solutions determine how far this struggle is formed.
In 1938 the German authorities would have been willing to strike against Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.

The course of history is turned into such places where the unbridled progress march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now faced with several of these translations.
What do we do if President Trump resigns Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for investigating the Mueller case?
Rosenstein has been hived since the public had become aware that he had proposed a secret record of the president's speech and considered the possibility of the president's inability to perform his duties.
Well, according to Rosenstein, The Times report is a mistake.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh is not complete or fair or if he is confirmed in spite of the credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony made in spite of the highest justice membership?
And above all above all, do we vote in the middle of the divided Congress, which considers President Trump to be responsible?
If we fail to do so, our democracy will be long and dark in winter.
But I believe that we will succeed for the lesson I have learned in Prague.

Rangers for Graham Dorrans as optimistic for Rapid Vienna's encounter with Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers meet at home on Thursday, knowing that in Spain, after a tie against Villarreal, the victory of the Eastern Americans would give the team a strong position to get to the European League G block.
The knee injury prevented midfield player Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before Villarrelin 2-2, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a pushbar for better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good answer", says 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and brought a point with us.
We may have been able to catch a win at the end, but overall, a tie is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half, and we got on the other side, and we were better.
There is another important evening in the European League on Thursday.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a tough game because their result was good in the previous game. However, I believe that with this group we will be able to give us everything and achieve a positive result.
The last year was really tough as to what I had to do with my injuries and changes in the team, but now it feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy; the exercises are smooth.
I hope we can now push fully, leave the past period behind us and succeed."

Although the participants had a clear vision of how they wanted to take care of themselves, only a few had spoken to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the transnational investigation reported that they were discussing the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10% of respondents reported that they had spoken to their children about it.
"Man wants family members to take care of them, but don't talk about it," says Holly Snyder, Deputy Director of the National Insurance Company.
Start this way.
Talk to your spouse and your children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell them what you wish in time.
Talk to your professional and family about where and how to get help, as these issues are an important factor in determining costs.
Take financial advice into discussion: advice can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
Financial options for long-term care may include, for example, traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance for these costs or self-employed insurance if you have the right to afford.

Federal prosecutors state state state state state state prosecutors are considering a rare death penalty to the suspect suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are pursuing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipouville, the suspect in the eight lives of New York City, who claimed a terrorist attack, which is a rare punishment which has not been committed in the state since the federal crime since 1953.
According to the charge of Saipov, 30, Home Depot used a rental car in his locust attack on the West Side Highway bike in the south of Manhattan, where he was driving on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the death penalty for the southern administration of New York, a death penalty is possible if the prosecutors are able to prove that Saipov killed eight victims "for purpose" and caused "for purpose" serious physical injuries.
According to the law, it is possible to impose a death penalty on both of these charges.
After weeks of attack, the federal law imposed on Saipova 22-based charges, including the charge of eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal code in cases of organised crime. In addition, the charges included charges for violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "serious planning and preparation", the prosecutors said and described the way Saipov did what he did to be "serious, cruel and disgraceful."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruchin, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the accusation is made in connection with a complaint.
Five of the victims were Armenian tourists.
The previous time the southern administrative district of New York has given its death sentence, it has been a decade.
The defendant Khalid Barnes found guilty of two drug dealers' murders, but he was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty has been last implemented in New York for the federal case in 1953, when married Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed as convicted of a conspiracy for spying for the Soviet Union during a cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the law, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any sign of regret during the days and months that followed the attack.
He told the scientists that he was doing a good job, the police told me.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by his attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
The police said that Saipov also wanted an ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He replied to a 22- personal charge that he was innocent.
David Patton, one of Saipova's public defence attorneys, said that the defence was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to demand death penalty and no recognition and no life sentence without freedom is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to the parties concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defence had previously requested that he not be subject to the death penalty.
The Conservative parliamentary representative says that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Mr Farage promised today in his demonstration against the Conservatives to "mobilize the civilian army."
Former Head of the Ukip said that politicians must feel the pressure of the Eurosceptics - when one of the parliamentary representatives of Theresa May suggested that he conduct negotiations with the EU.
A conservative line representative, Peter Bone, said to marchers in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "are already out" if Farage had been a brexit secretary.
However, May meets its deep-divided lines of interest in reaching out to the challenge that the conservatives in favour of staying behind, which involved in a separate demonstration against Brex in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his proposal for a Chequers-Compromism to keep up with the supporters and opponents of brext, as well as the pressure of the EU.
The beneficiaries are calling for him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite a setback and to force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposals and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull he wanted to "shut the Chequers proposal to go."
He suggested that Farage should be involved and should be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
The Congressman of Wellingborough added: "I am defending the brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers proposal."
He presented his EU response with the proof that: "We did not fight World War II to end our subjects.
We want to legislate our own laws in our own country."
The idea that the public opinion would have changed after the vote in 2016 was: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is a perfectly incorrect argument."
Andrea Jenkyns, a conservative brexist, also attended the march and said to journalists: "Sanon only: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote in favour of it, nor will it be the members of the party or the activists who actually leave the streets and are primarily responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their work when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians must feel the pressure if they intend to pass a decision on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
This is a matter of trust between the people and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we don't approve of it."
When he spoke to the excited crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to spin the Brex, they have to feel the pressure on your body."
"We are going to mobilise the army of citizens of this country, which gave us victory in the brexit vote, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is once again an independent, self-government and proud state."
In the meantime, the supporters marched across Birmingham before the two-hour event to be held in the city centre.
A small number of activists bled "Tories Against Brexit" signs. The group was set up this weekend.
The working party Lord Adonis mocked conservatives about the security problems they had with the party's application at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who say that they can get IT systems in order and for all technology for the Canadian plus arrangement and for the free trade in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no good brexite", he added.

Kuntter Botts passed Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became evident that Mercedes' team arrangements play an important role in competition.
Bottas had a good leave from the pole and left Hamilton almost his own luck in defending his right hand in the first two rounds, calling on him to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the shelter first and left Hamilton to drive a bunch of herds that should have solved the situation.

The team has done an exceptional job in reaching a double victory", Hamilton said.
Very poor body language.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not leak a letter from Christine Blasay Ford, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
When speaking at the occasion in Western Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate's Ombudsman before the committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was an indication of what was going on in people's 'industry, pride and dishonesty'.
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, mean, shy and dishonest," said the President.
"When we see publications and annual things, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you do this data?
Do you remember his reply... did you yearn for the document - oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak.'
Wait a minute.
Did we... no, we didn't leak," he added a senator to do so.
In July, Steinstein received a letter describing the charges of Fordin Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein argued that the leak would have happened in his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein said to the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his ban did not apply to the President who commented on this at the Saturday event: "I tell you that that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I've ever seen in my body language."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual harassment, and thought that the democratic charges would be used for their own benefit.
"They have decided to regain power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get power and rule," the Media reports the president with a message.

Paul Rowett, U.S. Department of Justice analyst, witnessed hours of research as an expert witness in the field of intelligence.
He described to the jury how he had used recorded information on his cell phone when collecting the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers' movements on the night of the victim's death.
Rowett reported that he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis had been contrary to his previous arguments with Chambers on the night that he died, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that Telis' cell phone was at Chambers's house at the same time that Tellis claimed to be his friend with Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford proved on Saturday that he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked whether Tellis actually told me that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis "he's lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
Based on the information recorded on the cell phone, they had known each other for only a week.
Rowett noted that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped him out his life," Hale said.

Another dark person?
The New York Child Child Nurse refers the couple to court because of a racist text message because of a racist text message.
The New York Child Nurse asks the couple for a non-discriminatory divorce after accidentally obtaining a text message from the mother of the child, in which she complains that she is "the second one of the dark-haired".
The church denies being racist and parallels the challenge of "recognition."
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, expressed her regret when the new nurse Giselle Maurice arrived to work on his first working day in 2016 and she was whitened that this was dark-haired.
"EIIIIII, AND A BETTER", Plasco-Flaxman wrote to his husband a text message.
However, instead of her husband, she sent a message to Giselle Maurice two times instead of her husband.
According to New York Post, after his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman had resigned Maurice, stating that their previous departure passports had received afro-American nurse had been doing his job badly, and he had been waiting for the Philistines this time.
Maurice got paid one day's workday and was sent home by taxis.
Now Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the divorce and wants to make up for 350 dollars per day for the six months he was originally disappointed to live and work in the family, but without a deal.
"I want to show them that you can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The party has replied to the racist objections, saying that the decision to terminate Maurice's employment relationship was justified because they could not trust him after he was offended by him.
"Mother sent her something she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We're not racist," Joel Plasco told me about Post's interview.
"But would you leave your child to notice someone you've been unfriendly to, even if by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Really?"
Plasco sided with the challenge of blackmail and said that his wife had received the baby two months earlier and was "very difficult situation."
"Are we going to start another hunt in a situation like this?
It's not very well done", the investment bank increased it.
While the trial is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple in social media, stating their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that the audience would not agree to a talking bear.
Her daughter Karen Jankel, who was born a little while after the book was accepted, says in a letter: "It is difficult to live in the position of someone who read the book for the first time before the publication.
It's fun now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
According to the fact that his father, who had worked as a cameraman of BBC before his dedication to writing children's books about toys adventures, would have been optimistic about rejecting his book, Jankel added that the 60-year anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bitter because his father died last year.
He said, "She looked very important as family members" and said that her father was proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and not a renegade guy at all," she says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced Paddington's success that way.
Even if it was about his creation, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone with my dying daughter.
His daughter had been grounded after the plane landed at the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors tried to save her life for nothing.
"They made a little difference and told me that the situation was really bad that he wasn't expected to survive," Ednan-Laperous says.
Then they called and said that my daughter dies in a few minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'm staying with you."
The medications that enabled doctors to keep their heart moving, they gradually left his body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now everything went out.
I could just sit there knowing that everything was running out.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who died of his daughter’s loss, rose into a plane among other passengers who knew nothing about the trial that he was currently conducting.
"No one knew," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears were pouring out all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding now.
"I knew how much he loved my daughter."
Dead women send cards to prevent suicide on the bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones are working to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and a phone number that can be supported.
Davis' son, Tyler, became depressed when he was 13 and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
"I would not like any parent to experience the feelings that I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydia, says his son was a promising cook with an infectious juniper.
"He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile lit the whole room."
However, he quit his job before he died because he felt like "in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old little brother found his brother, who had lost his life on his own.
Mrs. Davis says that she is constantly afraid of after-effects.
Davis created cards "for the people that there are people to whom you can go to talk, even if it would be a friend.
Don't be quiet, you have to talk."
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark 15 years after he had been together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was down or depressed or anything like that", Humphrey said.
"A few days before Christmas, we discovered a change in his behavior.
He was in the country on Christmas Day, when the children opened their gifts, he took no contact with them or anything like it."
He says that Mark's death has been a severe trauma to them, but they still have to make progress: "It will break up the family.
It will tear us apart.
But we just have to move forward and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at risk when the FBI starts its investigations.
"I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a time and scale limited research - we could perhaps achieve a little unity," Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee's 'devil' was giving the supporters a dead end.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican assistants want the FBI's investigation?
In contrast, it's about timing.
The arguments are only five weeks from November 6, and if the Republicans' success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the highest court of the country will be made more difficult.
George W. Bush has grabbed the phone and called the senators to allow them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met with his wife Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report was drawn up?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which is currently sitting on 51 Republican and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, so Vice-President Mike Pence could blow the game apart and confirm his choice to the highest court.

According to Park, key factors have been the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the increase in prices for road hauliers in human beings.
No comment on the matter has been made publicly.
Most of the North Korean locusts will eventually be offered citizenship to South Korea.
It is noted from Seoul that more than 30,000 North Koreans have entered the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
Most people run through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarised zone between the Koreas.
China treats the locusts as illegal immigrants, not refugees and most often restores them by force.
The relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the countries met in Pyongyang, and discussions focused on the negotiations that were taking place during the stops, with the breaking of nuclear equipment.
This was followed by a historic meeting in June in which US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong met in Singapore and agreed on a general level of efforts towards the nuclear integrity of Korea.
But on Saturday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yong-ho caused the United States of America to recover from the crisis after the meeting.
"With no confidence in the United States of America, our national security is not reliable and under such circumstances we will never, in any case, be unilaterally decommissioned our equipment first," Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelhis calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterist" and is inappropriate to act in the highest court.
Prime Minister Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh's "hysteric" to the Supreme Court's Supreme Court judge, and said that this was temporarily incompatible with the operation of the Supreme Court.
It was a game to comment on this issue at the Texas Tribune Festival event in Austin, Texas, Texas, in Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas, Texas
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, they would call her "hysteric", the fear of her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the accusations that he would sexually assaulted Christine Blasay Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in the power of his feelings and, sometimes, he almost yelled and lost his ability to speak when he told his family and high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats of the committee without calling themselves the "groteski and the intended person for persecution", which has been organised by the Liberals who were angry with the President-in-Office of Hillary Clinton for the 2016 elections.
Fear said that he believed that Kavanaugh's testimony would show that this is not capable of acting in the highest court, because it showed him to be partial to the Democrats.
"I believe that he made his own incompetent statements and the way in which he attacked Clintons and Democrats," Pelisi said.
I was wondering if he was asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if this choice would be strengthened and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say this - if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or to the FBI, he's not valid except for the Supreme Court, as well as the court in which he currently works," Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the United States Federal Court of Appeal.
The fear increased that as a democratic, he was concerned about the possible provisions of Kavanaugh concerning health reform or the Roe v Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative remedy.
In hearings concerning his assurance, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would repeal certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not appropriate for a hysterical and party person to be chosen to be a member of the court and we would be expected to find that it is wonderful", Pelisi said.
Women need to survive everything.
It is a legitimate fire talk in the wake of the rage of months and years, and it cannot be kept silently.
"We cry when we're angry", Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's anything unusual, don't you think?"
He continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a leading position somewhere and who told me that she was crying too when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to say to her talker in a situation where she was angry and started to cry: "You think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
Seriously, I'm angry."
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was genius."
pens are justified as a route of decommissioning, although they are generally understood as being fundamentally wrong.
One of the most amazing memories of my early work in the matrimony office is when I cried out as an unspeakably angry woman and an older woman - a cold-knife supervisor, whom I had always been a little scared - grabbed me from my neck and pulled me off the stairs.
"Don't let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're mad at me.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they felt sorry for your mind."
In the meantime, Mr. Schmidt, a representative of the Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential election campaign.
When Hart got caught in 1987 with a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the race, the very frustrated Schroeder's conviction that there was no reason why he would not try to be president himself.
"It wasn't a very well-informed decision", he said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven of them already, and the least of them were needed more than one more.
Someone called the situation ‘Lukes and seven midwives.’"
Since the campaign was long overdue, he was behind the fundraiser and so he announced that he would not go to the race if he didn't get two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
He was told that some of his supporters who gave the male candidates $1,000 only gave him 250.
"Do they think that I'm gonna get something for the discount?" he was wondering.
When he held his speech and announced that he would not start an official campaign, he was subjected to feelings of gratitude to his supporters, to a system of frustration that made it so difficult to collect funds for voters and the election work against the delegates, and to the sexisms of hatred - that he could not speak.
"I could have thought I'd get a nervous breakdown," Schroeder recalls the press's reactions.
"You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tomb stone will probably be beaten to be a memorial.
‘He cried.’’’
How a war between the United States and China can benefit Beijing in trade war between the United States and China.
The launch of the U.S. and China's trade war was earring, and although the battle is all but over, the country's gap can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts find it helpful.
The US President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import duties on key Chinese export articles, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
This week, a significant escalation took place with new duties affecting imported goods for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion) and effectively taxing half of all products imported from China to the United States.
Beijing has always answered the same amount, last of five to 10 per cent of customs duties on imported goods worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye-to-eye style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic continent in the world would be going to be going up for a while.
In order to allow Washington to retreat, we should give up on our own demands, but public worship to the United States would be far too humble for China President Xi Jinping.
However, experts note that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the US trade war may have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the dependency between countries.
"A little political decision, whether in Washington or Beijing, can create conditions that start with an economic downturn in one of the countries, and this is in fact a more dangerous opportunity than those who have been able to understand it so far," says Abigail Grace, who is an Asian research assistant at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Syrian Foreign Minister of Syria, the country is ready for the return of refugees.
Syria says it is ready to volunteer return to refugees and to ask for help to rebuild the country after a devastating war of over seven years.
In speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the conditions in the country are improving.
"Your record is now more stable and safer thanks to developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government is continuing to repair the area destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
The conditions now allow the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave for the unilateral economic activities of terrorism and their daily lives and of their livelihoods.
According to the UN estimates that over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian assistance in the country.
Al-Moualem noted that the Syrian Government would be grateful to assist in the reconstruction of the destroyed land.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that supported the rebels.
