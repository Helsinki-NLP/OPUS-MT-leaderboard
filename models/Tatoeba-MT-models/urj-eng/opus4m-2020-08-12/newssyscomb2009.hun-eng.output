The best-favoured victory in Austria, they have 29 percent
The two sides of the so-called major coalition have been significantly weakened and better populist groups have been significantly strengthened, according to the first preliminary findings, by Austria's forward-looking parliamentary elections.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), when the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, was seriously rocked, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, for the future of Austria (BZÖ), President of the State of Karintia, Jörg Haider, winner of national policy, will return.
On the basis of the results of the negotiations, the country's strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (RPÖ) by 29.8 per cent of the votes and, in comparison to the last elections in 2006, it will lose 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which accounts for 25,6 percent of the votes.
All of these parties in Austria's history after the war have been the most successful and, in particular, the result is literally disastrous for the People's Party that has created the most advanced elections.
In early July, when leaving the ÖVP coalition, the population had a significant advantage before the P.R.E., according to public opinion polls.
However, the answers obviously punished him for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results already made, speculations have been voiced about the possible resignation of Vice-Chairman Wilhelm Molterer and the current Vice-Chairman.
The observers believe that this could take place on Monday at the extraordinary session of the political council.
This development is likely to facilitate the most likely way out of the selection result, i.e. the renewal of the collegiation of Rö- ÖVP.
Tőtt was given 18 percent of the votes and 11 percent of the votes in advance by the Austrian Free Party (FPÖ) - but the social Democrats expressed their fears about the resumption of 1999 when the people agreed with the peoples in the Common Government (FPÖ was still a single one in 2005, which caused even sanctions for the European Union in 2005.
Haider, who has already said that he is prepared to cooperate with any party and to assume that he can enter Vienna into national policy, obviously this is a solution that matters.
Parliament has also been given the floor of the People's Party, which, however, has fallen from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties, which has fallen from third to fifth.
None of the other few crossed the four-percentage limit and did not reach Parliament.
+372: Indian relations may get colder in India.
If the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal beetles could not be solved, according to the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be a certain obsolescence in Czech-India relations.
This was published by the Minister in New York after his meeting with Pranob Mukherji, an Indian partner today.
"If this was not the case, then yes, there would be some obsolescence," he pointed out after the Czech incentive.
Mukherji, after the hearing, told me that the executing authority could hardly intervene in judicial proceedings.
He pointed out that, in the case of Mr Petr Švácha, the central government could negotiate with the local administration, the law of which was the matter.
"His problem could come to pass," said the Minister.
However, according to Mukherji, the three-year-old for Emil Kučera, it would be best for him to appeal to the Supreme Court.
You could apply for immunity for bail and wait for the sentence to be suspended, he explained.
Schwarzzeg proved that his partner expressed himself similarly during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to release him," said the chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is by providing the Czech party with "competent legal support" to the sentenced, this is the Indian Minister.
Of course, it was said that the Indian side has already provided such assistance.
"It is our main interest to maintain the best relations with India in the years of tradition.
This is also acknowledged by Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
Once, as you told the JRC, your partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists to be a serious mistake," he declared.
The question is whether the Indian side has given a guarantee to deal with the case, the helper has been excluded from the question.
"I have already given you quite a lot of promises," he said.

Steps into the wall of a strange map on which Australia and the neighbouring regions are visible.
However, it does not matter about the continent, but it is one of the most important points in the world.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with the neighboring seabed.
In the meantime, as far as the continent is concerned," says Austrian Lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is a member of the thirty-member working groups of the United Nations Convention on the Sea and the Ocean.
Chief, Mikulka Václav Czech Lawyer, director of the division, monitors the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
There is a sense of cooperation and enthusiasm here.
The sealand is rich in natural resources, and it is hardly known to be world-wide so far.
There are oil, ores and other minerals, but still unknown organisms, which, for example, may be the key to the development of an anticancer medicine, are also present here.
Over a million years of sea longliners.
Today, coastal states are actively applying for new sub-sea areas.
According to the United Nations, they are exercising their rights, as agreed at the Montego Bay in Jamaica in 19th January.
In particular, it is about the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred miles from the coasts of that country.
Such a country has, under the Directive, an exclusive right to all other parts of the continental shelf.
"Simplified, continental reefs are kept in the part and subsoil of the seabeds which are the natural course of the subsoil of the sea.
The coastal sea borders, often two hundred miles [200 km] across the borders of the coastal zone, are also beyond the economic zone alone," Mikulka explained.
The request submitted by that country to the Committee on the External Borders of the Continental Basin must be supplemented by a number of comprehensive scientific specifications based on cost-effective research and measurement.
It's a lot of annual work.
"One of our tasks is legal and trade-related assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five requests, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
It is now only the last three countries that have been successful," Mikkela says.
In the world today, today's success has resulted in echoes, which first and foremost significantly expands its sub-marine country.
De-Zeland has also been given a new land - the seabed area for which it has been granted by the Committee is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. six times the size of the country.
The country has invested millions of dollars in research.
The future use of the seabed will result in income being estimated to be invaluable.
Others also keep requests.
The ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention" may take place within a period of six years from the moment of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continentallands end, the area of the ocean plains designated by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity" shall begin.
None of the countries in this country anymore have a unique situation.
The right to output in this area is a party to the Convention.
"But the seabed is not Klondke", says Director Mikulka, saying that "some territories are legally clearly defined and laid down in their regime".
The two of them on the Pacific Ocean.
The sea is also part of the Republic of the United States of America these days.
This former Eastern era is shared with other countries in the framework of the Common Organisation of Interaceanmetal.
Under this agreement, in 1991, the entity received the so-called "transit investor" status in the same way as other investors in some other countries.
It has been necessary to produce it in the ClarionClipper in the Pacific Ocean zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area reviewed by the EIB is a little bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seaside is situated there, a copy of the Tatras under the sea.
"This total can be produced in a total of 75,000 sq km area.
The area is a rich place for polymetal ores containing nickel, reeds, cobalts and manganese," says another lawyer, the father-in-law Pashi Rajan.

German special forces were involved in hostage release.
The Egyptian government has asked Germany to help in response to the hostage crisis - and the mother has come.
When the situation became common, the separate units were ready, but no action was taken.
Its kidnapping of eleven European tourists in the Union is becoming more and more public.
According to the data of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Home Affairs, German forces were also involved in the rescue operation indirectly.
Thus, in addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the staff of the German Federal Police and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistical authority of the German Technical Service, were also on the scene of the release.
According to the Ministerial spokespersons on Monday evening, German forces were not necessary because the hostages allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government has agreed to help the German authorities to involve him as a support force for the scene.
"Fortunately this did not happen" - said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Home Affairs.
The attacks captured groups of five of the five seven, five of the Italians, one of the Romanian women and eight of their Egyptian escorts in the south of the country on 19 September.
After the kidnapping in the desert area of South Egypt, the hostages were dragged here and there in the borders of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The absence of hostages remains impeccable so far, as are the details of the release of the hostages or the possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the survivors arrived in the Cable.
Steinmeier said that the released hostage was protected by the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the exemption.
For the time being, there was no information about when they were returning to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and their forces arrive on the plane of the German Air Force Airbus on Tuesday.
The U.S. Parliamentary House rejects the emergency package.
In the United States, a small majority of the US have failed the $7 billion rescue package for the money markets.
Aowde fell into the depths.
The U.S. Parliamentary House, with 227 votes in favour of 206 votes against, replaced the government's bail-in for money markets.
Despite the efforts of President George W. Bush and some of his leading politicians, the majority of the programme, which was intended to contain the loss of living on the money market, has not been given the majority of its policies.
The supporters have tried without a doubt that, in a dramatic action, they will nevertheless demonstrate the need for the $7,000 package to be needed.
Mr Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called for the support of the Members, even if the plan is serious.
"It's hard to get political support for something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
Dow was still down by more than 6 percent and by 600 points during the vote.
In fact, investors were concerned that the state rescue package could be a coup d'état.
In short, before the vote, the index increased to fall again after the vote has been made public.
Other serious market failures are expected in the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme will be subject to the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The pipes are getting more and more reservations.
Good winter for German cabins.
In any case, the traffic of bookings for the following months has increased significantly over the past year - by more than 30 per cent during the winter season.
Despite the weak cyclical circumstances, the Germans' sense of travel did not seem to have fallen.
In the annual season bookings, the travel agencies accounted for 31 per cent of turnover compared to the previous year - on a weekly basis, the German Consumer Union (DRV) in Berlin.
According to the GFK Market Research Institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is already higher.
The net sales of travel agents exceeded 11 per cent on May 2007 and reported to the DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates it to the entire market.
The institution took into account the travels booked until the end of August 2008.
Travels to the United States for the second currency in particular - said the DRV.
Here, the volume of reservations has increased by some one third.
The Germans have especially visited Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the countryside of the country.
At the very least, organised searches - say Klaus Laepple, President of the D.R.
For increased energy and food costs, in the case of organised journeys, costs can be calculated "better for passengers than for individual organised trips."
In addition, passengers can save money with booking benefits or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The monthly booking rate of the summer months was also very good, so there could be a second increase in turnover compared to last year - although otherwise less German tourists are engaged than last year.

Without a break, repetitive ballerian hits, liters of walrus and designer dirndlie celebrities.

It is a turquoise diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
Far before Turkey wanted to join the European Union, the European authorities are burning up the desire to have a deep impact on the Turkish background.
On the east side of Biscurus, just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the most popular relics of the failed imperial endeavour.
The HYDarpasha railway station is designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Ültmut Conu, in a neorenismary bridge designed by two Germans.
At least that's what the book says.
The house surrounds the end of the platforms, one or two of the bells at each side of the corner, and looks like a town in Germany.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's all over the place.
However, it is clear from the inside of the handling ticket office that this was the westernmost port of the Grand Chamber.
The station was opened by the German consortium, Atolya-Baghhad, in August 1908.
Germany, the "later future" of the conquests, from Damascus to Baghdad, sought to achieve its ambition to occupy the Middle East through today's train to Saudi Arabia.
The German coup d'état efforts have come together during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Arab Lawrence and Arab patrols.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The British colonial army has left behind and has crossed out the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha dealer didn't do better than that.
In 1917 an ammo gun exploded, and the building worked out a lot.
The Turks believe that a sabotaging operation has taken place.
Since then, it's been a wreck, and it's been a long time since history has passed.
Today, as the gate of the railway to the Analtia and the entire eastern region, at least in a symbolic sense, Turkey is a comprehensive diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The government's Justice and Development Party - the ACP - thanks the country for a completely new foreign policy.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War has disappeared.
The new policy is characterised by commitment.
It is worthy that the Turkish Prime Minister maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Hamas and Fatah Palestinian groups, with Iran, and with the European Union and the United States today.
I wanted to explore the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the Turkish capital Antara to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish Parliamentary, Suat Kinkilu.
The next day, after about ten and a half hours of commotion, which has given me the tradition of the "The Night Mail" in the political document on the old world, I also go to the capital of Turkey. The new city is intended for the New World State, which turns its back on the past.
However, AKP paradigm with well-known Islamic roots represents a change in the Turkish consensus.
This raised some suspicions in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP's house, an ultra-modern, twin and steel building, specifically designed for this purpose, which is located in a suburbs of the rest of the city, between semi-prepared tortoises and coffee houses. In the latter, the middle management of the suit - both men and women - meets to make early business in the morning.

She was wearing a dress, a tie, and I'm sure she even had a BlackBerry.

He then stressed what everyone is talking about here, almost automatically repeated: Turkey not only has relations with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the countries around the Black Sea as well as with Europe and the United States as well as with Turkey itself.
It is as if they wanted to communicate that, with Turkey, Turkey, the whole of the world could reach Asia and the Middle East on those eastern railway lines.
Once again, when I was at the Hydarpasha station, another, largely awake night after night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conva, the two German gentlemen who saw the recovery of this fictional foundation ten years ago.
that they would have appreciated it if they knew that Europe's close-up ambitions were now largely in the hands of the Union.
And as I was waiting on the other side of the ferry to take me back through the Boscow, I thought it might be that Turkey was called "a sick man".
At that time, there was no doubt that which part of the country needed this country at the time.
The roadways that lie ahead: Vernon Handley and William Ferruff.
Read more: Since 1962 Vernon "Tod" Handley, the music director of Guild, led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on the city's music plans, he founded his basic youth school, Proteus, the next year.
After all, only people under the age of 21 could have been included in the singing board, but when the Proteus RES sang their final song - many of us in our 20's - they simply refused to accept the status.
The "Proteus" (the name of the mythological transformer) was in line with the age's determination and ability to cope with any bag they make - either the Madrid or a mess of the Messiah; with no compassion or great hospitality.
The musical diversity of such a young age was often surprising and always essential, and thanks to the man whose inspiration for our inspiration in music has remained unchanged in recent years.
How often he said to us, Tod, "Let's just let the music speak."
He always said, "The mechanic knows what he wants.
Everything is in the bag.
Sing it away."
The conductor's practice was always perfectly understandable and accurate, but it's always dictive or excessive.
Whatever the quality of music, he always highlighted it.
John Fray Turner said:
If he ever lived a conductor who should have been beaten, it was Vernon Handley.
I was pleased to meet you in the two decades during which you conducted the Guildford Philharmonics from 2nd to 19th year.
In the last forty months, as I have been critical of more than 100 clubs, but always, none of them are disappointing, and he has often swept them up.
In Tod Handley, it was great and modest.
He hated those conductors who, living with his words, were walking around the world with some well-known battles."

John Beckett says:
According to your report by William Woodruff (September 25th), "In 1946 he continued his economic history studies in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was still preparing for his basic degree, master's degree and PhD title."
The works of Byruff's "Beyond Nab End" are based on his notes, but wrong.
Between May and 19th, he gave reason to economic history at the University of Nottingham and, in the meantime, under the leadership of Prime Minister J. D. Chambers, completed his PhD research on the British rubber industry, which was then issued in 19 years under the heading "British Rubber Industry".
In 1950, in fact, he was in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1992 he was in the cities of Milan, New York and Harvard.
In the latter case, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not possible to know why Woodruff has provided his career during this period.

Second of all, a record at the Honda.
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation Jazz.
Of course, your predecessor had quite a lot of passenger space, but the development of the new internal aspects is even more extensive.
All of this comes with a sophisticated tool that makes driving more comfortable and increases fuel savings.
Eremo versus remorse.
Looks like the second-second Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz knows very much about its predecessor, it has undergone many internal changes.
These include, for example, innovative design, new carnations, larger sizes and new mechanics.
Before we change to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after its launch on the first-seventh market.
First, we can say that Honda will be able to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In fact, Jazz is hardly known, but lays down a record of sales in other markets.
market shares, where in 2002 and this year Jazz was the most popular car brand in 2008 as well.
Almost one piece of Jazz has been sold since its entry into the market in America.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million mobile sales over six years.
The Honda wants to further improve traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
While in 2007 the US market was selling 83.000 Jazz, by 2009 the prices target a 10 car for 10 cars, which would increase by 17% the European market.
Since 2002, the Spanish market has sold 8 000 Japanese pieces of Honda, representing 6.7% of Honda's total turnover in Spain.
For the new year, the managers of the female subsidiary calculate 2000 credits over the course of a year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly compensate for the decline in Honda's turnover in Spain.
In fact, the members of the company have sold 22,000 copies this year, which is 4,000 less than the data in the data in question, i.e. 16% less than the data in the data in question, which is 16% less than the data in the data in question.
Despite the sales terms, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% compared to the previous year's 1.6%.
By 2010, I would also like to support this ratio to 2%.
Honda hope that this could be achieved with a new model application.
It would have been the Insight, a five-chamber and compact - 4370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces per year in a global context.
According to the manufacturer, the United States of America would issue 50% of the market share of Inside, while the majority of it would be divided between the Old Continent and the United States.
Inssy's commercial application was due after the formal Valuation Session of January, in the first month of the year.
For the first generation, the new Jazz became more broad in all respects.
It has a length of 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), a width of 1690 mm (two centimeters longer) and a distance of five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
By contrast, the height of the height is 1520 mm.
In addition to which, the passenger compartment has become more spacious.
The greater internal space is guaranteed by the new throttle and by the central tank - we know this from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total capacity of the - so-called second pips - container has increased, currently 399 litres, i.e. it exceeds its first generation capacity by 19 litres.
Although this includes that these sizes apply to the type fitted with a motor of 1.4, since the 1.5 Honda Jazz parcel is 379 litres.
Other external amendments are also possible, such as rear-mounted lamps or an optional pantograph roof, as well as easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the doors in the rear seats have been increased to 80 degrees, compared to 67 degrees in the first Jazz.
The second-second Jazz engines are also new.
At the start of its operation, this small model is available with two engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is better than in the previous model, with low carbon and excellent mechanical consistency, but the engine provides excellent performance in all respects.
The power of 1,2 litres is 90 horsepower at 6000 speeds and a torque of 114 Nm at 4900 speeds.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous jazz, has a consumption of 5.3 gallons and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.

For the purpose of the accident prevention work, Nissan is a new source of inspiration from the nature of Nissan, just from the bees world.
The Japanese ship designed a robot that would avoid accidents by imitation of bees.
Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C instrument may be the first step to develop impact control measures.
Ms Aissan Motor Co. Fejlyt Tööszői Központsége egy fényes Ügyös Fejlettő és Teknological Research Centre for Science, Japan, in cooperation with the Centre for Science and Research, these little robots were posted in Japan.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director-General for Technology PR- and Research-Education, has been identified as a further development of the BR23C of Nissan's horizontal protection shield.
The robot complements the ability of the company to connect to its products.
During the course of the flight, each bee develops its own elusive-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, it is more important than this to play the role of the complex eye of the womb, which in all directions is more than 300 degrees in any case.
To mimic the complex eye function, the inspectors planned a so-called laser distance (Laser Range Finder).
The device identifies the obstacles within a distance of up to 2 metres in a 180-degree field of vision before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is converted directly into an operation to avoid contact.
"As soon as an obstacle is detected, the little robot mimics the movements of bees, immediately changing the direction of the wheels to avoid contact in a smaller or larger way.
The system is the most different from the instruments currently available, that in this case the emergency manual is automatically completed.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Lab and Prime Minister.
Unlike bees, the evasive may not take place either upwards or downwards, and in a transverse manner, it can only move in two parts and only in the direction of steering the wheels, i.e. not infinitely and in the way it is done in the case of bees.
Therefore, Nissan also used a rotting function to avoid collisions in addition to speeding and slowing down.
"This structure should process and respond to data every few weeks.
There is no need for data to be stored, neither for intuitive logic based on previous Mays, so that it can operate without interruption with a few dozen KB memory.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but it's not even about megabyte-sized memories.
the first step is to develop a technology for immediate impact control, which, according to Nissan's estimates, can enter the hybrid cars within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and longer than the lithium variant.
The additional application of the unit can be combined with the GPS satellite navigation system, so that the automatic access to the terminal is avoided.
Fear from the mortgage provider
We have to recognise that the US Treasury Department, apart from being able to manage a lot of investments, has little to no common sense.
Since the crisis is at stake, and because the United States of America is not likely to be questioned by mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "bad loan business"... i.e. the Gauls.
The description of the house and, in particular, of the receptionist's covetousness suggests that we should consider it again, again, again, in fact, more three times, if the date of the loan has just arrived.
And where to pay credit, that's a good thing.

It's for the same kind of hairdressers as for the general public.

Morgan Stanley announced that it had a stake in the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Company (MUFG). The largest bank in the UK is paying $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital, after the price of Morgan Stanley's shares went down high on the stock market.
The next one after the opening of the initial agreement, the two banks said that MUFG would buy 9,9 % of the Morgan Stanley shares at USD 25,25 in total for USD 3 billion.
The accepted price falls by more than 19% of the value of the net assets at 31 August.
MUFG will invest another 6 billion dollars in the purchase of negotiable securities, which will provide a 10% return and a conversion rate of 31.25 dollars.
According to Morgan Stanley, for the purposes of the implementation of the Central Transmutation, the exchange rate is 29 USD, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
The currency exchange rate for Morgan Stanley dropped by 6a.m. at 17 p.m. on average and closed at $13.77.
"This Commonwealth offers a great deal of opportunity for Morgan Stanley to speed up the transformation of banking into a company," explains John Mack, CEO of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status that could diversify its operations last year, while under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The MUFG agreement reaffirms once again that the current financial regulation requires even more caution from the companies registered on Wall Street.
It is clear from the terms and conditions announced on Monday that the agreement has been amended over the last few days: on last Monday, Morgan only announced that 20% of its shares were sold to the Chinese customer for about one billion dollars.
"One year ago, we thought that the share would be made up of fully-owned shares," explained Toshihide Mizano, CEO of MUFG, in Tuto.
"However, given the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect potential risks."
In terms of the weighted average, MUFG pays 7% more than the value of its assets for the whole of its shares.
The result of the transaction is about 20% of the share yield.
Under the agreement, MUFG may convert its primary shares into shares in a year's time if the exchange rate of the latter exceeds 50% of the exchange rate over a specified period, i.e. up to 47 USD.
Morgan can use the funds from MUFG to make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its cash-flows.
However, the group's spokesperson did not need to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the accession of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to add around 1 % of its Tier I rate, which will be the best in its own sector.
Morgan was of the opinion that it has been "definitely" improved since the end of August.
The last week has been a great challenge to the group, since the exchange rate of its shares has fallen to half, while the cost of covering the risk of non-payments has escaped to the sky.
This cost was moderated on Monday, but remained high at around 12%.
One of the major banks remains "excessive" after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the take-up of Mermaid Lynch. This Goldman Sachs, which has recently reported to have reached $15 billion, is a part of the Förkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa's Monday statement, Quito
The Republic's reconstruction in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint plan for the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the U.S. Rafael Correa.
On Sunday Correa, following the model of her presidents and friends, expressed her views on the new constitution.
His mission was successful, since 64% of the votes voted in favour voted in the referendum, according to the official conclusions concerning 80% of the votes cast.
According to this, 28% of the population did not vote, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of them were unfilled.
Constitutional adoption was required by 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, two times a week at the exit of the voting offices and a non-governmental organization's invoices both proved the vast majority of 'yes' votes by 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa has already spoken about the rule of the Constitutional Law on Mondays.
"The Constitution has won a tremendous victory," he said, and thanking the U.S. Governments in Guayaquil, which is located in the south-west of the Thu Thum.
As is well known, Rafael Correa Chávez, Morales and the President of Chile also congratulated Michelle Bachelet.
In the report of the United States of America (OAS) mission, the vote took place in a atmosphere, the main topic of which was a 4 point text summarising the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The Constitution places state power in the service of the economy, holding the right of the State to "design development" to a country that essentially lives in the currency of foreign companies in terms of oil output and foreign exchange.
The Constitutional Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also regulates the power of the State, which may acquire mandates for up to two consecutive periods, and is entitled to disband the country.
Correa has already announced that she will take this opportunity and will once again compete for the state's mandate in February 2009.
The President has already begun this change in his country, with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population living in the state of existence.
On the other hand, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the Quito and Washington Agreement on the use of the U.S. drug-related agency based on the U.S. drug-related measures.
Released from the 19 hostages in Chad.
He's got a commando in his command on the kidnappers, who have been taken hostage for ten days by eleven tourists and their eight escorts.
The hostages are now in the Cable.
Eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were detained in the desert for three days and transported unharmed on Monday afternoon to the Egyptian capital.
The hostages were released by an Egyptian commander in Chad this morning.
Apparently in good condition, around 4:30 in the area, they arrived at the Al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to the Caribbean International Airport.
The hostages were banned from commenting to the press and were immediately transferred to a tower in the suburbs of Cairo, Malta, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers are "my money change" - said Zoheir Garanna at the airport as an Egyptian tourist minister.
On 19 September, the hostages were captured at the foot of Ouanat Mountain in the provinces of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in a brute safari. The group was then dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 hostages.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five Germans and one Romanian woman), and eight Egyptians: two visitors, four drivers, a police officer, and the director of Agyptous, the director of the Agyppeus.
According to a security officer in Egypt, a special 30-year-old commando received two helicopters to the location where the hostages were attacked just before the current.
"A firefight has emerged between the troops, and the kidnappers have been crammed, and the others have fled," said the speaker asking for his name to remain silent.
He also said that a total of 150 special teams were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Team to Sudan, where German and Italian commanders were added.
Mr Franco Frattini, the head of the Italian diplomat who is currently in the country, stressed the role of the Secret Service and the Special United States Task Forces.
"We must recognise that this result would not have been achieved without the strategic and effective involvement of our secret service members and our political groups," he said, without further notice.
He denied that the hostages would have paid a ransom.
The next day, the Sudanese United States of America announced that a cruiser was being arrested during a patrol, on which the kidnappers were traveling, six of them (including the Chadn call), and two of them were refused.
It is claimed that the hostages were related to a strange heater organisation, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately dissected by the body.
Lettres - The "quiet majority" of culture
The debate on the management of culture is currently at the heart of the press and the election campaign at the moment.
We can only be happy about this.
But a piece of our life is still being given away.
Who will choose the word to point out what kind of serious amounts are managed by the little museums, archives, historical monuments and national historical monuments on the edge of hunger?
Is it any political to remind the federal government that it does not care about its historical and cultural heritage buildings?
Or that there are no laws in either Québec or China that are effective in the performance of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government has only turned three and a half million people into the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all governmental bodies.
Within the framework of the Québérc Historical Society Association (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), the company of 211 subjects, cultural heritage, archives and audiovisuals has over 40 000 volunteers working on the research of history, as well as on the conservation of large private archives and archaeological remains, with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with teeth and nails and object to the last of the suffocation when real estate developers and decision-makers direct our old buildings and lost cemeterys to bulldozers.
When is someone going to stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
A Part of Fortis Bank is a State of the Benelux regime.
By means of a single state aid, the Benelux States are in trouble in the Belgian-death bank, Fortison, because of the shocking effects of the US credit market crisis - first of all Europeans -: three countries support a financial and financial institution with Hungarian interests with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Governments have agreed at the highest level on this matter on the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's liability for the matter.
Fortis is the first major in the euro area in the context of some international financial market crises over more than a year, and decisions in the field of business are therefore, in certain respects, considered to be of precedent value.
According to the decision taken on the day, each State in the near half of the country (49 %) is taking advantage of the bank's existing assets.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, in particular, the Dutch ABN Ammo activities that were purchased last year, mainly insurance activities.
Fortis's shares started to fall into a sharp fall last week, during the second half of the week there have been serious developments in the marriage.
However, the criteria are that with 85 thousand employees, the bank is too large to let it go bankrupt.
Papers only fell by about 12 percent on Friday, 14 years in the week.
Since January, the value of the stock has fallen by more than two thirds.
In terms of current prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the CEOs, this is not realistic.
The company is also responsible for the overseas market uncertainties about the adoption of the $7 billion US package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers rose slightly on Monday.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed to the bank in the name of Filip Dierckx.
The bank is also looking for private money, but no one's been asking for a real deal yet.
The Belgian government has already stated that investors do not have to worry, they do not lose money.
The bank's clients have not so far developed panic, the branches have not been shaken.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own property and has also purchased leasing companies.
Piss in the stork.
In fact, life and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude insurance contracts with their customers on the basis of the information available to people's medicines.
Data subjects fear that the data market will be inviolable.
"There is a data protection programme which shall, in all cases, make the use of pharmacovigilance data subject's consent.
This must be independent, otherwise we trust the fox with the hens" - triggers Richard Dicket, the developer of the program for monitoring prescriptions for medicinal products, the Washington Post.
The Republics depend on the health status of the population on the premium and the amount due in the event of damage, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not make any insurance.
In the old years, the person was sent for a technical examination and the contract was only awarded in the light of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick has been working out a much cheaper method for ten years: from the archives, he will find out exactly what medicines he has bought over the last year and a half years, and this program itself will determine how much he works and how his health is.
For example, if you are taking a regular high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually extremely high, which is the highest risk category.
The programme has more than one version of the scheme, some of which determine the risk ratio at the same time, and the insurance undertaking has little to do with this except for the insurance sector, although some difficulties arise.
Some medicines may be used for more than one purpose, such as the use of compounds against migraines or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurance, which is not the case before.
The data were requested and processed by special associations, and before obtaining the necessary information from the warehouses, they ask for the patient’s consent.
This is now being done by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their sentence so far.
Some companies are already processing the results of laboratory tests and are associated with the data on the use of the medicine, so that they can provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more people have access to data, and monitoring the use of data is, at the same time, becoming increasingly difficult to control.
There is a special health data protection law, but it only applies to healthcare services and insurance.
Before the convention, there is a legislative proposal that gives the authorities control over the undertakings that specialise in reporting.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough: this is why he has developed his programme, which would make it easier for him to transfer the data.
The other issue is that it is not possible to refuse the contribution, otherwise it is not possible for the motor vehicles to make it.
So the hens all refer to the goodness of the fox.
Global Marseilles tableware
Trade is doubled by the European Union and India.
As between the European Union and India's mutual leading trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit is also on the agenda of the other, and most of it is on the agenda.
Today will also be the French-India Summit, where nuclear cooperation is mainly concerned with nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognises that India is an uplifting global power that should be given more voice in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet succeeded in reaching a common understanding of whether New Delhi's permanent membership in the United Nations Council is being supported.
This question was not addressed at the Marseille Summit last night, which is now the fourth summit.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President-in-Office of the Union, and President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana, received Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, and also agreed that they would double over a period of five years, that is, they would increase trade to a good hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
Thus, in legal terms, there are twenty-six bilateral civil aviation conventions, i.e. air traffic, which could also exist in the future.
India wants to sign up to the Free Trade Agreement with the Union until 2009.
Labour has suggested speeding up reconciliation.
The aim is to balance the fact that, while the EU is the first trading partner in India, Newly, it is only the fourth place among the EU's partners.
The summit paid attention to the global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - the latter in both parts of the world - were condemned and urged to call the United Nations Conference to be convened.
The completion of the Doha Round has also been advocated, although they both have a large part to do so so far.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its fuel and climate programme, which means that it will reduce its fuel emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
It was also agreed by India that a global agreement should be reached at the climate conference scheduled for next year and that the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent a rise in food prices and to support a meeting of experts on the review of the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister today goes to the French capital, where he is working on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
They are confident that the French companies will receive 20 billion euros for building Indian nuclear nuclear power plants.
According to the information available, the Agreement would be for 15 years.
More than three hundred books in a row of over three hundred books.
Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field in the United States of Great Britain.
More than three hundred Italian publishers are present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmese Fair.
This year, 7 000 exhibits are expected from 101 countries on a 171.790 sqm base area, where more than 403,000 books are presented.
At the opening ceremony in Pavilon in Italy, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary-General of the Ministry of Culture and Activities: Italy, through the establishment of a single Italy Point, will cover a 264 square meter exhibition area.
A formal opening to the press conference under the heading "Room Struktur" of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion will be sent, which includes a summary of the data, trends and conditions relating to the situation in the Italian book issue.
According to this, the share of foreign employees in the US is constantly increasing, especially in the area of adult and youth literature.
They found the billionaire of the year, Steve Fossettt, who was a billionaire, who was a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's request, who disappeared from the Nevada desert on 3 September 2007.
The wrecks were found on a 3,000-metre high plain, located in the Mammoth Lakes, in Mount Sierra Nevada, which supports the border between California and Nevada.
No human remains found in the inside of the weapon were found.
Johnson, Sheriff of Madera County, all existing doubts were disbanded: "After determining the location, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure that it is the machine on which Steve Fossett was flying away," he said in a press release.
The Sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was reportedly dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Office (NTSB) stated that a few hours after the crash, a committee of inquiry was asked to identify the plane and to conclude that it was actually the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fosset took a three-hour flight from NWA Yerington.
Also in Stockholm, near the Nevada border, a few of them found Fosset's personal belongings near Mammoth Lakes home.
Two identification documents by Fosset's name, issued by the International Aviation Authority of Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was terminated after a month's disappearance.
The billionaire has raised many peaks that have allowed itself to be entrenched in history.
In 2002, at the sixth quarter, he managed to fly the earth with a balloon at first: two weeks a day.
A year later, a plane turned the ground without landing.
Its record also includes the Andes, 15,445 meters in distance, which it did with a second pilot.
GLK, amazing smell.
An ostrich, therefore an ostrich and a solid-state hottie with large surfaces and cleaned-up beams.
This is all the more so as the newest "compat highway" of Mercedes-Benz, which the German car manufacturer has tried to provide up-to-date propulsion to the market.
This is because of what is happening in the last 17 years.The entrance of Så GLK is also a surprise and palvelut.
At the same time, the new vehicle's presentation of the new vehicle is subject to an unknown media communication tool so far, including through post-opistic 3D posters, which have not yet been used in the USA by car brands.
The billboard action, consisting of three stages, will rule the central market trade of the country until 15 November, the Corso Comoto .
The first phase of this new media communication is intended to present the car in a cross-cutting manner, with the help of the new SUV, the Corso Como network, which will be displayed in a real and three-dimensional form.
The image viewer will feel like it's going to be the same thing as the car from the mall.
After that, through the Ethnic Life8 economy, each detail of the new GLK is shown in some detail that it consists of a single point of view.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is using this promotion to try to put something new into the stereotic news of the automotive industry.
Is this to arouse the interests of future people?
We'll show you who the Italian football leagues are.
It's the people of 30th century, and it's not like they're going to be able to keep you from the trails.
But who is this 150-200 friends and girl, for whom the whole of the universe is lying? It is called "Ultras Italia", which has been following him for many years, and which, truth be told, does not believe too much concern.
They didn't even get into a fight with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The main shelters are from Trivento.
But also from Verna, Padua, Triest and Udida.
They joined these in their Wordful News of the Campan and Puglia, a few sporadic groups (in fact, just a few units).
They were flying Italian flags on which the town of bulge was marked: on Saturday, they were removed so that they could not be identified.
Consider the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they were faced with a true Nazi cheerleading force, the Drunkers of Iran.
The Italian football league has issued 144 tickets to the Italian fans. These were names, so it would be easier to check the team.
The Ministry of Home Affairs has checked everything: there was no problem between those who went to Sofia, no one who would have been banned from the stadium visit.
Four Italian fans with a history of football, guaranteed tickets and trips.
At present, the Ministry of Home Affairs is waiting for protocols from the solfian staff, and then taking the necessary measures: the supporters who have been arrested or identified during the riots can also be subject to five-year bans.
It is an international ban, which applies only to the monitoring of all European stadiums in Italy, but only in Europe.
Therefore, our football leagues cannot put their feet on any football career.
Lucky for you.
However, we must also fear that the nebula can be found, i.e. that the United States is one of the world’s most important ones, others join.
"At the same time, this fire must be repressed, and no excuse should be given to anyone who does it," said the Ministry of Home Affairs.
It is best to keep an eye on our eyes, especially since we are close to the date of the match for Wednesday, Lebe.
However, there is a smaller cell that supports Italian pupils.
The Monitoring Service will meet on Tuesday, and the Security of Sport Events Report Committee, which may also be a party to the Homeland Security Service, will meet on Tuesday on the Secret Service for Scurvy Crime.
"Duce-Duce's scan and flying arm under the Italian pompom?"
This idea has been put forward quite seriously, Domenico Mazzilli, who has been appointed to serve the Ministry of Home Affairs for a few weeks (posted by Francesco Tagiente before Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazilli used to be the Head of State of Triest, the city where he has been working since 2002 as a supporter for the Ultras Italy Group.
What Mazilli claims to be true is not prohibited in Bulgaria to live in Duce, but the behaviour of the 150-200 fans was still infrequent.
I'm not a socialist, I'm the first man to do it, but the crimes have to be committed in the country of the crime.
Until now, this support has no problem. We need to examine exactly what happened and consider how further.
But let's talk a little bit about the whining of the Italian hymn: it doesn't make any difference, but, if I may say so, it can't be regarded as a good thing..."
