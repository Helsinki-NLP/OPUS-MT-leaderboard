The purple stock market at the end of the market cost less than at the end of the market.
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the rapid collapse of the food.
Transactions in shares in the Czech Energy Company (EEZ) reached close to the usual day.
The Prague Stock Exchange immediately continued its fall from the start of the Tuesday trade on Monday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, there is a fall in Wall Street shares behind the back.
Thus, the market reaction to the vote of the United States of America has also shown itself to be the result of a vote, which has rejected support for the stability plan of the financial sector there.
Shares held in Asia
The Asian stock exchange was driven by a dramatic fall in shares in the middle of the day, even though the evidence of the day was paid out at the end of some of the losses.
The Hong Kong Sound Seng stock exchange index described almost four percent of the trade, but later some of the losses were cancelled and decreased to approximately four percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Chinese stock monitoring Sound Seng China's Index dropped by 3.8 percent, and in fact the markets were closed down.
The shares in Adney's stock lost more than one percent, but ultimately the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese Stock Exchange fell by 3.6 per cent, according to that way.
"The timing of the US rescue mission is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," stated Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China is part of China, its currency is expressed in euro, i.e. from the central bank of China.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
Kevin Rudd Australia thinks that U.S. lawmakers should immediately resume negotiations and accept the financial system support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries may also feel the consequences of this.
The bloodbath of the U.S. States is the bloodbath of the U.S.
On Monday, the U.S. Parliament submitted a draft to support the financial system, to which USD 1 billion (up to 12 billion) should have been translated.
Lawyers have also ignored President George Bush's call to support the project.
Therefore, the draft would resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, the U.S. Fields have gone through a massacre and during 20 years, the leading gunfires have been hit by the biggest crash.
The Dow is nearly seven percent, the last time he went through a similar fall was in 2012.
The reason for the vote was already before the vote, but, as it turns out, the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index was released.
Congress resigned: The U.S. Government can thus pump a billion dollars into the banks.
The Government of the United States of America and President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader way to reach an agreement and a financial instrument for the financial system in the United States.
The vote on this next week will take place at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of a financial contribution of $700 billion (around 12 billion kronors) to the U.S. financial system.
But there is no victory yet.
The convention must complete some of the details of the agreement before it is possible to make public the final form of the law and their force.
The financial system plan is being discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
This afternoon, he briefed the Reuters News Agency, Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Affairs Committee.
According to the Senate, the draft is likely to be voted on as soon as possible.
According to the Commonwealth, there should be information that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the recovery of the financial markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will then be a "recognition".
Thomasson: The plan must be effective.
"We have done a great thing.
We have resolved different views on what should be the form of a package to stabilise the market," he said to the Bovine Agency of the Democratic Party Pelosi.
According to him, the final vote could take place on a day-to-day basis.
The lawyers' representatives met Henry Paulson the other night, the US finance minister, to give the government funds a complete form.
This should buy away from financial corporations the incredible mortgage activity that is causing financial corporations to lose and undermine the stability of the entire system.
"We are in the final agreement on a draft which will work and which the market should be effective at the same time.
The amendment has to be followed up, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Marking the Asian market.
The financial crisis has a significant impact on the markets, which are falling rapidly.
The Democrat Senator of Harry Reid Nevada says that the legislators are trying to reach an agreement in the future.
In fact, it is possible to reassure the farmers before they start dealing with Asian money markets, where, first of all, the decision of the association could affect the Monday party, as a result of the time zone.
However, it is not clear, however, that the two Chambers of the United States of America are voting on the law, and neither is it, that the negotiations at the last moment are not allowed to go away for a problem.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still undergoes many changes.
The total amount required to assist the system shall be divided into two parts:
President George Bush's request for the first billion dollars to be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may exclude the issue of the balance amount, which is set at another $10 billion and later at USD 1 billion, if it is likely that the programme will fail to function.
Bish assessed progress in the future.
While the President may waive this decision, he may, however, review the Statute of this decision.
However, despite these changes, the basic principle of the programme remains, which was the acquisition of material instruments to absorb the valuable mortgage heaps, since several thousands of others are unable to repay their mortgage credit.
"all work out.
The parliament should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," says Senator Judd Gregg Republican.
The progress made in the negotiations was also welcomed by President Bush.
Tony Fratto, spokesperson, said that the president was satisfied with Saturday's progress and assessed "to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy by making two-sided efforts".
Allowance of bus end-of-life benefits
The head of the negotiations, Christopher Dodd, Chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, on the protection of taxpayers from the costs, on the verification of the benefits and on the timing of the draft financing.
The new law also governs the so-called bus termination of directors of the programme, and sets up a board of directors of the fund.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards a position that will work and which will be useful for all the Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance to the household owners who have problems with the payment.
The government should create new write-offs for the loans it buys, in order to help the debtors to reduce their monthly write-offs and to allow them to keep their houses.
: Literary assistance is provided by:
The proposed draft is proposed by David Marek, the leading economist of Patria Finance, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"For whatever reason, it is not possible to know what a factor and at what a price it is going to take up problematic active substances.
This will determine how the financial economy and government share losses," said Marek to the iHNed.ƒç web site this week.
According to Marques, it is irrelevant that the plan is approved now or next week.
"It is much more important that the convention is now this week not that the plan is supported and, as far as possible, they give thanks.
The spiritual importance of the agreement is that the plan is approved, the most important thing at the moment," said Marek.
On a couple of sides: MP3 players mobiles.
We will help you to choose how to help you.
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can play MP3.
It seems clear that it is better just to buy a phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which it is used and on the future owner.
It is likely that you will find it difficult to get a high-end play play at home to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear with bass disks, but, of course, there is no objective reason for this to happen in quality.
If, however, the police are full of art rock, jazz or blues, it is likely that they will make such a playful play.
This is similar to travel powder, combined - simplified with MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories here.
For some, it can be unacceptable to give out two thousand years of age for a player, as it would probably be difficult for a Pink Floyd fan to accept a 20-year-old market listener.
Two extremes, each of which has plenty of space.
There is a wide choice.
_Other Organiser
A few high-end music players can do much more than play music, but also what most of the mobilizers can do.
No device now is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calls and text messages, you can play music and video, pick up everything, have a better-bad camera, even navigation.
And if you take into account the smartphones and communicators, you'll have a little computer in the back.
It's a little wonder, since no fridge is able to use a grill and no one can take a picture.
The multi-functional mobiles have therefore disadvantages.
The more functionality you use on your mobile, the more you send it to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest online players in the world.
Small amounts of instant equipment can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, most of which are less able to play music.
In this field, the musical players (commonly the simplest ones) play a much higher role.
In the case of private mobile phones, this is because they don't want to do this for a few more minutes.
In addition, if you're still here, get a new charger for your job - it's also for expensive tools.
The MP3 player will not have such a problem, even the worst of the players can handle at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one charge.
The problem arises when music is uploaded to the cell phone.
Both devices have only a limited number of universal USB connectors, and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a specific software.
The music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without an adapter with the use of a mini-mode memory card in mobiles.
The player does not need any special software used by some other players (iPod).
The device will be upgraded from the computer with a key via USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a music library by themselves, based on the name of the performer, the album, the genre, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices represent only a wooden structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easy to use, players know more.
The choice of specific equipment should be made primarily for the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and, of course, for the treatment.
If the music is primarily used on the back of the game and listens to it for a short time, for example, on the internet, any MP player can play mobile.
And this is really anything that can do.
You don't have to be particularly careful about what kind of music the mobile or player knows about.
The MP3 will cope with this, and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most common, and most of the devices also deal with the Wma-style key.
AAC (the last and last format used by Apple) does not exist.
Better mobiles can, for example, allow on-line music shopping.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the service provider (or other service provider) through the mobile internet and to buy the song or album.
This service can in itself be a strong argument for the use of music on mobile phones.
All of them, the service providers supply is dirty and usually limited to the United States of America's radio stations.
Price is not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this is the way in which music is currently managing the future of the music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless internet).
Most people have always kept their mobiles alone.
Any time you want to hear something, your cell phone taps you in the back while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it is also important whether he is still carrying the earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, the loudspeaker can be used, which means that everything is mobile, but only a few MP3 players have access to it.
Many people will probably have the greatest advantage of music mobiles at the price.
The lowest cost is usually less than a quarter of a million crowns.
Between three and four thousand days, you can get quite a walkman between you and me.
However, in most cases you have been restricted by the lack of the output of the traditional listening machine.
The best and most technically available phones can cost up to fifteen thousand kroner with traditional 3.5 mm-long wired earphones.
On the other hand, the advantage of players is simple management.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily manages the cheapest players (see our choice).
Minimum function, the previously used routine sauce treatment similar to a magneto or again is obvious.
There is no risk of collapse in the randomly switched mobile internet and does not involve a huge bill for data transmission.
Choose a device to choose from.
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. wire 527) have usually access to interchangeable memory machines (M2, microSD type, etc.).
He also had access to the right card at almost 2,000 times.
But it's okay.
Basic types shall support only cards with a maximum power of not more than 2 g.
Only the most expensive know what to do with up to 8 G's memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a MP3 player, choose Cowon, the Cowon, the Sony, the Market, Emgeton or the Irvert.
Based on the production (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1,100 years of age.
If you are a minor student, choose a special mobile walkman (Sony ~sson, some Nokia and Simok).
These devices also have a separate MP3 controller, the handling of which can easily access the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Erics, which has the same user interface as the special sold MP3 players, is the farthest in the world.
The above brands MP3 players can provide the same service in the same price range for up to 4,000 days, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator life (over a total of 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach its destination this year.
Addition
The Czech mobile market is relatively well and our services offer practically the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, we do not have anything here - the virtual service that causes a significant price reduction for individual service providers.
It's not gonna happen again.
On Mobil.c, we have often written that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the ƒåT√∫, which pointed out that text prices are at a lower cost than in the rest of the Union.
Following the last step taken by the European Commission, the regulation of roaming services could possibly lead to a conflicting situation - Czech mobile service providers will be cheaper than domestic text messages from abroad for some customers.
How is it possible that Czech prices are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition for real battles.
This may sound contradictory, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is highly above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile services would like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In many cases, Mr. Pavel Dvoccak, Chairman of the Council of the United Communications Council, has also been in agreement with the fact that he has recently said that there is no new service provider in the United States.
It may be true that there is no such thing as a high chance for the private service with its own network (which is likely to be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is also another option - the virtual service provider.
In particular, the introduction of virtual service providers into the mobile market was a significant reduction in the price, which would then have to be reacted to by the single service providers.
In addition, before entering the home market, such as the Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, there were similar voices.
However, it has been proven that such service providers have place and can indeed be successful.
For an excuse, you don't have to be too far away from us.
This February, we informed you about the start of the Mobile Virtual Service in Germany.
This service provider has not been able to obtain more than 100 people in the last six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Otherwise, it is the Penta Financial Group, which is also the head of the U:fon, but also the head of the U:fon.
The benefits of virtual service providers are the possibility of a much smaller target.
In order to operate effectively, less customers are needed than the traditional service provider.
In fact, it does not entail a relatively high cost of public works, mobile services and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world are in general low - they offer calls and text messages, but they often counterbalance with few services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers text messages at least 50 percent cheaper than its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of Moscow in Poland, it can be a good idea to be given a target group.
This service is particularly focused on men.
"The real man chooses the Mobile Service - who I like who you can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of this virtual service provider Mobil Entertainment?"
I can't tell you if I have an idea similar to that of the country in which I work.
Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω, the spokesperson of the Vodafone, argues: "The Czech market is relatively important for the feminist approach, on which most of the virtual service providers are based.
In addition, the provision of services is proportionate."
In the Czech Republic, it is impossible to set up mobile services.
However, it seems absolutely certain that if there is a virtual service in the next place, it will not be the Mobile.
"The success of this project is a matter of success, but in the latter case the negotiations do not seem too hopeful.
While doing so, it will take place more and more in other countries of our region," said Jana Studniƒçkov√°, spokesperson of the Pentaal Group in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
In fact, it has been demonstrated that the Czech single mobile service provider is not too closely related to this idea.
On the contrary, they are making every effort to ensure that there is no competition in place.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has not been interested in the launch of the virtual service, which now requires another step to be taken to make Local O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"It is important that we be able to provide both fixed and mobile telecommunications services to everyone.
As much as possible, it's better than that.
This possibility was discussed again with all Czech mobile services.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson of the support.
Maybe now it's better times.
Unofficially, it seems that the first virtual service provider can be lucky for us by the end of the year.
However, it is currently surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
"At the moment, we do not think that a fully-fledged virtual service provider should have access to the Czech market.
Unlike the rest of the market, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been told by a single, multi- and serious project provider in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about the Department of Telephony 02 of Vlastmil Sr≈°e√®, Telephony.
Other operators also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrova, the spokesperson of T-Mobile, in agreement with O2, says: "We have not yet noted any viable and bilaterally beneficial research projects on which to base it."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year it is unlikely that any virtual service will appear.
At this moment, there should be a specific agreement at our table to be able to watch on such a long journey."
The Focal Point will focus more on fulfilling its own 3G limit requirements.
Miroslav ƒåepick√† adds: "We are open to negotiations with possible virtual services, particularly in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
For customers, this is what we consider to be the most affordable of all.
The main strategy of the Vadafone in this area is to find a way to develop networks for high-speed mobile internet."
Responsible agencies - a string with the services.
A mobile service provider's procedure is easy to understand, a new service would lead to increased competition, a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profits.
Why, then, should we facilitate the entry of a particular competition?
When service providers have something important to offer, they are able to cooperate, they also testify to the pipeline around the birth of U:fon.
The greatest pressure on ƒåT√∫ was probably due to the birth of the T-Mobile company U:fona.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the CIT√∫ website.
But right now, the U:fon is well-founded as not to allow the virtual service to enter.
Martina Kemrov√° added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market was affected by access to the fourth mobile market.
With regard to the Czech mobile market, it is clear that another player's entry into the market and its services would impose high requirements."
However, the total failure of the Czech regulatory body to respond directly to such an attitude of mobile service providers is an amazing one.
Besides, it is not about the attitude of the Czech Republic, which, unlike Great Britain and other developing countries, has no right to intervene in the economic market.
Only the European Economic Area is entitled to do so.
However, the office is inherently related to the whole problem.
"The entry into the mobile virtual service market only after it is possible to conclude a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for the provision of the necessary collateral.
All of these agreements were not concluded, since the offer of potential interviews was probably not of great interest to the traditional service providers," said Kristi√°n Ch√°gua, from the Department of Economic Affairs of the Republic of Korea, in response to our question.
It's not a surprise from the members of the service.
However, the aid that consumers should represent and, moreover, ensure that no one recovers from their market situation is more than extraordinary.
In particular, if Kristi√°n Chalu adds: "Outwards, where virtual service providers generally operate, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of the price of mobile services."
However, pressure does not fall within the scope of the OOHS's interests on the proper functioning of the market and on the reduction of prices.
In this case, there is indeed a shocking correlation between the response of the two mobile operators and the response of the two mobile operators.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence, it's almost obvious.
As at filling stations, the same gas prices must be the only ones that compete in random and in the same way as in the same gas prices.
"In this case, the Authority did not detect any signs of an illegal procedure, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
Neither service provider has a leading position, which means that it has no more responsibility in terms of its market shares.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably also missing by the telecoms regulator," Chaluvo said.
The presentation of the position of a leader is one of many points of discussion.
It is true that the analysis of the relevant factors developed by the ƒåT√∫, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition, exists.
Of course, no Czech service provider in this market is in a position of leadership.
However, some legal experts also have a different approach - it is essential for the virtual service to be approved by the network operator.
And the mobile service - relatively logically - has a monopoly on its own network.
In a certain nobility, it is necessarily dominant.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be minimal for OHS to think that the two mobile operators are acting significantly the same way.
In the meantime, complaints made by interested parties (including the GTS Novera company mentioned above) indicate that there are very similar obstacles to negotiations between all service providers.
On the other hand, the transfer of responsibility to the ƒåT√∫ is a relatively common practice in telecommunications, with which the OHS takes his hand off the whole case.
Here are some other situations.
In the text of the recently adopted Act on Communications, however, it was hoped that many experts would improve the situation in the field of economic commerce.
This is something that the members of the OOHS need to know well, but it is likely that they are different.
This works when no one is watching.
However, the operation of some kind of virtual service provider, many of which are already operating in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone prices, but they are only a few public.
It's about the same marketing firm.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies often only reach the selections.
It is based on the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate client against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that all Czech mobile trades prohibit the same provision.
"If there were any cases of breach of the terms and conditions of the contract which we were dealing with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrov√° answered our question about this problem.
However, it is likely that news about this kind of activity would not have reached the responsibility of mobile operators.
In particular, three of these companies may be concerned about several individuals.
In the meantime, no service shall defend itself against such a procedure.
In particular, unlike actual virtual protectors, these companies have no negligible income and, in the meantime, they do not threaten their own official market.
Miroslav ƒåepick√Ω warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however, the services of these companies are only used by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card is not their name on their phone, so this cannot be fully provided as a general customer of mobile services."
But at least this is what ƒåT√∫ should be doing.
In addition, another question for the OOHS is also a question for the OOHS.
If mobile operators have a similar procedure, why can't they stop the virtual service coming?
It should be done that the UOHS has a relatively strong authority to expose such an activity, and, if you do not want to, you need not be satisfied with the service providers' argument that nothing has been suspected and that their terms of trade are prohibited from doing so.
There will be no time for any of the most expensive items.
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual services into the mobile market has led to a marked fall in the price of services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual service providers are involved, core service providers have tried to do more and less to prevent them.
The arguments they use were practically identical - too small, perhaps too relaxing, and they are also of the quality of their services.
At the same time, however, in the developing countries, regulatory bodies have been involved at the same time, which have protected not only the mobile services but each of them.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, it is the first virtual service that has been followed.
At the same time, the Czech authorities are giving the whole thing to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get away with the impression that inexplicable competences are helpful in these cases.
But don't give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is sure to be published soon, the Czech mobile market would be blocked again.
If one service provider would allow a virtual mobile service transaction, the OHS would only be unlikely to be indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other players.
And for the rest of Europe, we probably don't want to eat much more.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best one.
provides a four-pronged version of the new version of the Czech State Humanities.
Sunday, Prime Minister Mik Topol√° of the United States of America solemnly presented the new recordings of the state hymn on Sunday where is my country?
The music of the National Theatre was recorded in the music of the National Theatre with the leadership of the B√≠lohlabs of Ji'i.
there is a link between male or female males, male or female.
Kateina Kn≈æ√≠nkov√° and Adam Pachetka are singing.
The author of the amendment of the hymn is Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krƒçek.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
The Czech national song is considered to be one of the most beautiful hymns of all.
He has already told Radio that he deliberately selects young, representative singers who are expressive and popular for the collection of these variants.
"From the outset, I sought to ensure that both of them, and later at the school, were clear, clear and consistent," he said.
The Czech State is celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
Where is my home? first song in the Rendi Theatre was silenced first in 1834 in a play by Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovaƒçka in 1834, in addition to the music of Franti≈°ek ≈†kroup.
It is popular and is considered spontaneously to be their own.
And the first round of the first round became a natural part of the State Humnus after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
Even after the formation of the independent territory, the seven state symbols remain one of the seven countries.
What's a "new" hymn?
In Prague, the first time on Wednesday, I also delivered a chip card.
Wednesday, 1 October 2008 will be included in the history of the Prague Transport Company on the date when the first passenger enters the subways, trams and buses, each of whom will have a ticket in the back instead of a ticket.
The card is currently available in about a hundred thousand people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day card (which will be valid from January 2009) and at the same time buy a chip card in the information units and outlets of the Transport Company at the metro stations of Muzeum, M'stek, N√°dra≈æ√≠ Hole≈°ovice, Andill, Roztyly, Let≈àany, Kobylisy, Rajsk√° zahrada, Kaƒçerov and Luka.
The coupons are now going through the Internet via the Transport Company www.dpp.
The service was used by more than four hundred guests for hours this afternoon.
Those who are starting to use the Internet may in fact forget the publishing windows of metro stations, where they have had to go through long lines for the ticket.
The coupon can be bought via the Internet and is also saved on the Opencard card in one of the 13 parts of the Universal Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a desk-taught server, who help visitors shop online and save their purchased vouchers on their cards," said Martin Opatrn√Ω, the project's spokesperson.
In addition to libraries, e-mails can be saved to Opencard in the self-service machines provided in some halls.
What do these machines look like?
The reds, they remind me of the pilots, and the passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud≈õjovik√°, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk√°.
"There are currently five of them in town, but there should be eighty at the end of the year," said Opatrn√Ω.
The card is the driver's auto-check.
It will be easy to change tomorrow's automatics.
All you have to do is insert the Opencard chip card and leave the previously paid coupon itself.
From now on, e-moneys will be valid not only in the capital but also in its place.
City-wide trains and bus lines from 300 to 499, which mainly travels to the capital city of CentralCzech.
"On trains in Prague integrated transport, the boaters were equipped with card readers to determine the validity of the coupons," asked Draper Philip from Ropid, who compared the schedule of public transport in Prague, to check the number of lines.
In the city buses around the city, the card readers at the driver's office are encroached at the cashier.
At the time of entry, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place the Opencard at the office specified by the office.
The driver thus checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if a passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way to ask the driver to do this," Drapal said.
Passengers who don't drive buses around the city and who won't be able to tell when their bus is running, can go to the self-service machines that save the voucher cards again.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Soviets wanted a referendum from the United States.
The Soviet Germans were requested to be attached to the United States of America in 19th century.
This is evident from the background that is in the archives of the New Zealand Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the US's Patronate.
It is claimed that this request was made in 19th century by some groups of Soviet Germans to the President of the United States.
Of course, this is from a private file, which is currently stored in the warehouse of the South-Czech Republic.
The Germans in ƒåeƒç Krdlov are, in fact, asking the President of the United States not to allow the return of the "≈°umava County" to the Czech Republic, which has yet to be taken over by the Treaty of Munich.
"The situation has been correctly understood and we really want to be sure in the words that the American troops are going to be no repressive or enemy, but as a liberator," is in the words "the others who love the fate of Shumuva" in the words "of those who love the fate of Shumuva".
Since attaching to the Czech Republic is supposed to be the Soviet Germans, with the knowledge of the Czech national character, to hope only for brutality, cruelty, non-recognition, oppression and slavery, the author calls on the President of the United States to take over the vegetative "now and forever".
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four dozen people, this area would be regarded as a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is not a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is a country that is part of it, and that is a minority that has nothing to do with it," says the rest.
The reason the authors could not sign is claimed to be a fear of "chech repressors".
If, therefore, the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in ≈†umava, it would be sufficient for the President of the United States to give a referendum on whether his residents wish to be part of the United States and wish to live during the flight of the United States of America.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive in addition to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians describe the then expectations of the Sudet Germans appropriately.
Even if the Czech Germans had had to reasonably suspect that they were being deported from the country, only a few of them were missing this option.
Some have expected that the United States and Great Britain would have a kind of autonomy for the Soviets.
Other people trusted that they would remain in the only region of Chechnya.
This is true of Gustav Chalu, also the Austrian journalist from the ƒåesk√© Budjourg in Austria.
During the war, Chalu served in the Baltic Sea as a Budjovic German at sea.
At the end of the evening, when the British chased him and put him in the prison camp in Hollywood, dozens of other Czechs came to teach them in Czech.
"They trusted that when they returned home, they would be well served in the Czech language," Chaluvo said.
According to German prisoners in Chechnya before today, no one calculated that they would be deported from the country on the basis of the Beneks decrees.
You don't think - pay.
The dynamic campaign is attacking the leaders.
The Czech Republic is the lowest price for road safety in the past year.
It would thus be characterized by the emotional media campaign that the Transport Department wants to pursue on Wednesday.
Ministerial Office of Kele≈° ÔÄïeb√≠ƒçek from this campaign assumes that he will deter the leaders from dangerous conduct behind the government.
The campaign of 150 million will be published in television, in the atmosphere, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
The leaders should be alarmed by speeding and drinking.
And it should also remind them that their seat belts will be inserted before they leave.
In particular, young drivers, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least professional drivers want to have a conscience.
And what do they see in the billboards?
Emotionalism is a story.
This is also evidenced by the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan:
You don't think - pay.
The phrase "not thinking" on the license plate is written in large numbers.
And in the meantime, the word "pays" is used.
This should be a symbol of the fact that man can pay for a moment's loss of attention in his life.
The viewers will be "fearful" by the public mail until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where victims of victims can be seen in dramatic images.
They believe that this will result in the number of accidents and deaths on the Czech road.
The posters are made by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Get away from me, get rid of the drivers.
"The driver's system of "twitch it, push it" is in place.
'Easy' is when they pass through the truth, thereby saving time.
"Put it down" is what you are.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says Martin Koy√°n, transporter of Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why there is a need for an information campaign in the public, primarily for a discussion campaign, which is the following psychologist:
According to him, the driver's patrols are less affected by the warning signs.
"If the hazard warning sign is equipped, it is likely that the environment will blend and the leaders will not deal with it," he warned Koyana.
There was only one way to return all of the occupied areas in exchange for the benefit of the ransom.
Mr. Ehud Olmer, the interim President of Israel, spoke about the return of practically all the areas occupied in 1967, namely the West coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan plains, in exchange for their reward with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in the second one, which was published on Monday by the Jediot Achronot on a daily basis.
"We need to agree with the Palestinians, which means that everything is all if we don't have all the areas (independent) to be returned," Olmer told the daily.
"We will show a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without this there will be no peace," he did.
He admitted that any feedback would include East Jerusalem as well.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through his feet, as he did with one of my best friends, each of them must give up," Omri noted, pointing out two ways of attacking Olm, some people who have been killed and some others have been injured.
The principle is that it will be possible to find a "special solution to the Mount Angel, to sacred and metrological places" in Old Town.
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 277,000 Arabs.
This is not going to work," he stressed.
The exit from the Golan Straits is an exit from the Golan Straits.
He also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan plain, which, according to him, is an essential condition for the treaty to be concluded with Syria.
However, this would require some effort from Damascus as well.
"I do not recommend a bond with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they have to cancel to kill Golan.
They must cease their current relationship with Iran; they must cease their relationship with Hezbollahhal (sitting movement); they must give up the regular support provided to the terrorism of Hamas (sitting movement), Al-Qaida and Jihad (st war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister pointed out.
Questions after an accident: Is it illegal for passengers in buses?
The law doesn't recognize them, it's not allowed to walk in a bus far away
Regarding the tragic bus accident of the Student Ageny company, near Padua in Italy, the question was whether passengers and passengers can travel in the bus during the journey.
"If we are to comply strictly and formally with the law, the passenger's activity is contrary to the law on transport," says Karel Hanselka, spokesperson of the Department of Transport.
Last week, the death of a twenty-two-year-old passenger was most likely caused by the driver of a truck around the bus road.
The poor girl was currently sitting next to the driver, the bus was least in its safe place, although there were two more seats for her.
The bus may or may not crash at the moment when the passenger provides a coffee or a message.
It is important that the bus is licensed for use by the licence.
If the bus is not homolysed, passengers should be seated.
The locations of the long-distance buses of the Agency, which have also been confirmed by Radim Janƒçura, the company's director, for Aktu√°lnƒ´.cz.
"We've tried to find a way out of this space, and they didn't allow passengers to move at first.
However, this has been withdrawn, and we have come to the conclusion that passengers can go to the toilet on the road if they have their seats," he stated.
The law does not know the passenger.
"there is no common legal regulation on the role of the passenger - no law regulates this position.
However, there is no law prohibiting the provision of services to the consumer.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle; it does not define rights and obligations," says Mr Hanselka spokesperson.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn√Ω, Director of the Vehicle Operations Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers that the law manages the problem properly.
"It depends on whether or not the location of the bus licence belongs to the location of the bus.
That's it, that's it.
Buses can be urban, where they are located and have a limited maximum speed, and seats between cities and at higher speeds, as well as seats at distances and maximum speeds, with seat belts with seat belts at maximum speed.
Like each, I'll tell you what the expert is.
Jaroslas Ho√ü√≠n, BESIP's safety expert, does not see any problem in the absence of passengers on the bus.
"There is no danger of continuous progress, and the situation can be compared to that of the day-to-day service.
I'm not sure when there's a turbine and the air traffic controller can beat his head."
"But if the bus were to slow down, of course, its laws are valid.
The same as in urban buses or yachts.
Passenger safety needs to be resolved by the predator by internal rules," he says, and believes, that the law has not solved the problem.
Janƒçura is ready to take over services.
The Agency offers passenger services as the only bus and coach vendor.
Two hundred cabins have been operated.
The Director-General shall not take any risk after the accident.
"But as I will have the impression that the occupation of the cabin crew is dangerous, I will be put to an end.
Coffee and tea are available to passengers when boarding.
That would be cost savings," you say.
In its vehicles, the lack of passengers is justified by the safety interests of Alexej Litvin, the Director of the case, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We have no cabin crew, we're against this from the outset.
Sooner or later, this will end up with some kind of fatal injury," he told T√∂den. z a year ago.
An incredible tragedy has happened.
The company's two-year-old Plzetian young passenger has died during a flight in Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the exit lane without using a sighting and stopped on the bus route.
The driver of the engine was suddenly trying to get out with a manor, but the right side of the bus was in contact with him.
The fact that he would have sold two seats to provide cabin rest, Janƒçura refuses to give up his duties.
"These places cannot be booked on long-distance flights, seals."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
By indemnity for his daughter's wife, the Agency does not expect a court of law, but requires financial compensation on behalf of the offender.
Do you have a legislative amendment?
At a long time
Improving the mobility of passengers on board the bus could mean an amendment to the legislation, on which the Transport Ministry's 30-person team has been working for more than a year.
"The group, however, has not come to any concrete conclusion.
The busses are not so busy, but the point system deals with the speed of the freeway and driving mobile," says Ho √Åj√°rs√©ger.
"The Department of Transport does not consider the activity of passengers to be a fundamental threat to the safety of passengers," states the hanzolka spokesperson that the control of the safety of buses falls within the competence of the police and the employment services.
The hope of d√ºsselnofi is going to pass.
The letter from the WestLB Board of Directors to the Bank‚Äôs staff does not exclude the major points of view.
From the merger of D√ºsseldorf's financial units and the Bank of Deka-Blank in Frankfurt, "the central bank of the savings bank group" could be set up - on Monday's date.
ALAB would take you into a business like this for a permanent period of time.
Such a link could give the crucial shock to further concentrations in the regional banking sector.
This reading is when a board of directors wishes to prove its ability to act in times of difficulty.
Although the uncertain WestLB bank remains under strong pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Authority, which has recently known the state government in the North Rhine-Westphalia that it is limiting the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, it has been a long time since between Deka-bank and WestLB, which is known for its investment funds for the retailer's customers, for some reason, is also a question of a kind of connection - a strange part of France.
Franz Waas, head of the Deka-Bank at the end of August, expressed in an explanation of the half-yearly data that the Bank of Mainzer Landstras is located and a Land Bank of the Province, such as Helaba or WestLB, does not understand the meaning of the merger of Mainzer Landstras.
Nevertheless, the Deka's Board of Directors, on the one hand, and the representatives of the Land Banks on the other hand, on the other, and the Savings Stocks Associations, on the other hand, instructed the Board to negotiate with the WestLB on joint business activities.
In this case, the capital economy or some of its parts may be involved.
The negotiations - the financial background - have only just begun.
With its 3000 employees, the name of Deka-bank, which is one of the most important employers in the French financial sector, does not occur in connection with the consolidation of the retail sector.
In 2003, for the moment, it seemed that the Deka Bank was united with the Clasbank Rheinland-Pfalz and the Igaba.
However, none of this third-party alliance has yet been found.
In recent years, plans have been published, the Government of the State of the States of the States has spoken against the interest of Helaba.
After that, the two sides did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfaz is located in the place of the Stuttgart Squaresbank in Baden-Pf√ºrttemberg.
However, again and again, the idea of the relationship between Deka-bank and the Landesbanks has been reintroduced.
Last but not least, G√ºnther Merl, President of the Helaba Board of Directors, spoke against plans for mergers with the bank.
This means that the recognition of the need for convergence between the various banks in the sector is understood.
Now, following the elections in the region of Bavaria, the first contact between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg is expected.
This is hardly good news for Helaba.
If there is pressure on the other joints, the potential partners will be able to afford them.
In Germany, he can only be a younger business partner in Germany, while the financial crisis has so far been much better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
ALB merger with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-T√ºring, an 8 percent business company in Tanaba.
The NordLB is better off staying at the NordLB.
However, such geostrategic weights are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how different business models of individual banks are compatible with each other.
In June, he stated that the German Committee of Depositaries and Publicity has not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future of central banks.
It is possible to extract WestLB, which, of course, is not clearly required there.
Thus, the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Boards of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Boards of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Boards of Directors of the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors shall also
How this interacts with the unity of the individual units with the Deka-Ban is still the future's story.
Aztofilf√∂ld √©ts√©ge "olasz √©ts√©ge"
It's the first, it's the third or the third time for Luca.
But now she's like the girlfriend here, and everything else is different, say Luca.
Behind them, the Kaiser branded five-litre barrel stands a strong, personal-made bearded man and suggests to some 14 people that he can make deep sounds out of his throat.
First he'll have Luca's face, and then he'll kiss him.
They came to Verna from Bologna.
Here, from the bus stop at Puorta Suuva airport, four buses departing at 23.45 am with a "destinazione Monaco, festa della" destination, scheduled for arrival at 6.30 p.m.
Two are mainly held by the Italians, while the only ones travelling in the fourth are the Brazilians.
One side of the parking lot is that the South American people have already gone on a song next to their flag, they've been celebrating during the night.
And so loudly that it's not for the Italians - says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by the long, outer hair-dressed coat and by Marco with a large silver-sealed nose.
He's been carrying you to Oktoberfest every year, only three times this year.
A season there, during the day in Oktoberfest, home at 22.30 a.m.
The accommodation would only mean an extra charge, say Marco.
The road costs EUR 75, which includes a German language course in accordance with the Bajoran Statistical Act.
And now the buses themselves are going to the night on the freeway back to "Brennerro".
No, you don't. You don't.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will fall asleep.
They're still interested in their strength.
They are located in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where the bus 8 has a short stay at Munich.
When Marco's group arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week according to the plan, there is almost another airport that has arrived from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, and Marco is holding another last release, introducing the military plan.
First: everybody put on the yellow hat.
On the left, you can read the phrase "Oktoberfest" written with the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaviagiando.it", written in fractional pens on the left.
Second, "When the hangar's gates open, run," she yells "Macco" in the morning.
"Go!" You can find your reservation in the back and in the back of the boat.
"not because we're missing, and not in the same bench, let's not sit in every yellow cap, but spread out in the tent."
The one-litre bar costs 8, 25 euros, screaming at Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guard that you're having fun.
If you leave your seats, they'll be taken!"
Third, "Tonight, be here again at half past eleven." Do you understand?
And now we're on our way to Wiesn.
In the meantime, one of the male motorists is attached yellow caps to the streets, to the plates, and to the election posters of one of the major Bajoran peoples.
Preparation must be prepared for withdrawal.
It's Oktofilf√∂ld k√∂ny√©je, aka "ol√°sz√∂e".
No point numbers; they are talking about 50 000 people who cross the Alpokon berontata in the mersatatrak, ten per cent of the total number of people in the week are from the USA.
The police in Munich are being strengthened by seven police forces in southern Chile, and Italian volunteers are helping the Bajoran Cross, which in its national statistics employs about 200 per cent of the benefits, before the Austrians (approx. 80) and the bottom of the drums (approx. 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofb√∂r√§u ranger is especially popular.
Nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors.
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by the Federal Minister for Finance of Peer Steinbr√ºck only recently.
It is true that the policy used the word "relatively" and, in fact, it has even stated that the German banking sector is not spared by modern developments.
This is what happened this weekend.
The Daxon registered HYPO Real Estate (HRE) real estate finance company has received a billion-dollar loan from the German banking consortium to protect itself from market market market failures.
On Monday of the year, Reuters was told that the loans were worth EUR 35 billion.
The cost of Hypo Real Estate is only to be charged to the benefit of the benefit.
The money comes from private and public banks.
On the other hand, the Deffa subsidiary has losses.
The government depfa has provided loans for long-term projects, according to one report, and has refinanced itself for a very long period of time - which is now not possible due to the infidelity of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank‚Äôs reserve was reduced by 95 percent to EUR 2,37 million and the equity ratio fell moderately from 1,6 to 1,4 percent.
Revenue and revenue from monetary transactions returned to zero in the same period of the previous year, revenue from the liquidation of credits and fixed assets in the Community and the provisions of the transaction decreased by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
The net income from the remuneration of the ex-Depfa group's ex-post accounting expenses and the income deficit of 16 % thanks to the remuneration of the tax interest and the consolidated companies were relatively moderate.
The one-time public finance company first issued corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently ordered in Aeral Bank, following the privatisation in 1990.
Due to the low level of public finance, Depfa has been more involved in infrastructure projects and in joint projects between private investors and the State (private partnership, PPP) and has extended its activities internationally.
The value of subsidiaries is now required by Hypo Real Estate to provide a description that has a "serious effect" to show the results of the group - it has been reported quite generally.
It's a fact that you didn't pay your dues.
The commission was reduced by the third by 2007.
Since the transfer of the Depfa, Ahypo Real Estate has become a state and public authority since the transfer of the Depfa.
It is more dependent on other financial institutions than on the financing of the banking market, since it does not have any commercial deposits.
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two months ago, the credit of banks to each other has been exhausted since the banks are maintaining their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate requires long-term assets to refinance a part of the Bank's loan portfolio - some EUR 50 billion - each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate's report, the company's financing needs are covered by the loan for a transparent period and the company is protected from "the use of highly operational international financial markets at present."
In other words, the refinancing is guaranteed until 2009 thanks to the money.
Mr Munke, President-in-Office of the HRE, pointed out, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group did not need to have access to financial markets for a transparent period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the market power of Hypo Real Estate is now assured.
This gives confidence to the bank‚Äôs shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamic and inexplicable nature of the crisis, some people cannot.
It is not even impossible that financing is not needed to be fully used.
However, the contrary cannot be excluded.
After the bank was still at the bottom of the bankruptcy, after the late summer of the summer, it was not possible to reassure the weak, even the permanent rescue of the permanent transition.
The exchange rate fell by 75 percent to EUR 3,30 per cut.
On the other hand, the bond exchange rates are quite well maintained.
While the first-placed loans change, the exchange rates of the reversed bond have fallen considerably.
In particular, the crisis affects the bonds of the former subsidiary, the W√ºrttemberg Hypo, and possibly the overdues over the year 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds have previously appeared to be a speculative investment alternative, their balance of value now has to be considered to depend on the centrality of the international financial system as a result of the banking crisis and the fact that the money has led to the currency being transferred from the Depfa.
As long as the banks, governments and the less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it may be possible to start the repayment of the benefits by the deadline.
Or it is what is happening, which at the moment no one is willing to hope to fight for justice for the next 15 months.
However, reports on partial disclosures show that the legitimate likelihood of certainty has now become merely a legitimate remorse.
Long-term creditors may find it unsuspecting to decide whether to choose from their investment.
Long-term investors may use the sale as a reserve for taxes on foreign exchange income in the following year.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Charcoal.
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is required to introduce himself at Tachibana High School on his first day of teaching, the audience starts to gloat: The German girl is totally "wait"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manganese - in the new exchange students' blog, she's talking about the story.
"the first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
On the way in, I was incinerated on the way in.
I'm on the edge of the road, heading for the Curriculum, and going on a train for 40 minutes at the Tachiban High School.
I had to find my own way home. Fortunately, I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachiba is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The student starts talking at four o'clock until he talks to the teacher at eight o'clock, "home room".
But when the teaching began, it was my turn to introduce myself.
Besides, I'm not the type of person who wants to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
I haven't had a school uniform, I've picked up a new housewife's skirt, I've got a shirt, I've got a kneecap, and I've got black shoes.
So I was standing in this box in front of the cathedral, and I tried to say it all right, "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - Sylvana, from back home, and in a week's time, my mother will be my mother.
At the moment, I've really been learning the language for two years now.
All 31 girls were whispering, whining and waved, and I kept saying the word "intended".
I've already seen this from my mangai.
It's about basic Japanese vocabulary, and it means "hot, sweet."
On my way to my place as soon as possible, I ran to my place.
The girl next to me smiled a lot, and it was an honor for her to sit next to the exchange students.
The rest of the hour was calm, but when the bell spoke, they were generally rushed.
Everyone was talking and nervous, and they used their names to drill holes in my stomach - but it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
In the meantime, after that, everyone was able to take out their insides.
My hostess has also made such a meal - this is completely different from boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I've got spiced rice, some sausages, salads made of cucumbers and hazelnuts, fruit and some kind of tofu-flavoured meat.
Most people have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they are absolutely fresh.
In fact, everything is very good.
Yeah, well, except for the salty plum head, bro.
In Japanese Japan, it is not only easy to pray in Japanese schools.
It may be a girl gifting a boy a handcuffed daughter-in-law, which is specially made up of artists - in the hope that he can meet the boy at lunch next time.
I read about this in your manga comic book.
I wonder if this might be observed here too.
"Why is it that Japan?" was my girlfriend's value when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year.
I always said:
"For he always charms me."
For years now, I've been reading the least mangae for years.
And I don't understand the comics and the words I used to learn.
It was quite clear to me, though, that I would have to go here sometime.
I'm a fan of the essence and of the customs.
And they're very expensive here.
On the one hand, the country of the best practices and trends - on the other hand, it is all over, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even though it is the biggest city I have ever seen in my life."
Those men also have their own emotions.
In one or all of these cases, he is a fugitive. Does that mean that he means that he means fear?
Scientific Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have religions.
But how can it be determined whether they are the same when they act the same way?
In the "Edge" Internet magazine, scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
In one of the series "What Does It Mean to Be True without proving it?" the question was answered.
I believe that nature has emotions and other states of mind, without me or anyone else being able to prove this. It is true that we cannot yet prove that other people have knowledge.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of every human brain will be the same.
However, as we look at other species, and we analyze the sense or generally the expression of our senses, it is not possible to enter the field, as the hardware is not the same.
When in danger of a storm, it does the same thing as many other animals: He pretends to be dead, you're on the run.
People do things differently, which results in comparable personal experience for some researchers.
I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it easier for us to transfer our own personal experiences to food.
In some cases, human consciousness-related currents are always included in the lateral submersibles (in the short term and in the role of executive/management).
This scope is lower than that of the other primates in man and seems to be completely lacking in other life-forms.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal brain, such as the fact that we are who we are or, if we are able to make decisions and make decisions, it is reasonable to assume that man is also different from other primates.
An additional dramatic feature lies in the language nature of man: It is a part of the language, it often suggests that it is affected by it.
In such a case, the animal may be excluded.
However, even if the language does not vary from language to language, the language would have a certain effect, since animal knowledge, however it may be, is likely to be highly different for most of our states.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine what it is like for the other animals.
If the consciousness of the inside and the subject is not measurable, and because of the local hardware, it cannot be created by our own knowledge, then its research poses serious problems.
Most of my reasoning concerns the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be accessible to science.
Its power processes could be analysed without regard to their content, and this is exactly what is happening in the case of experiments on minor memory of the primates, in particular in the case of visualisation.
However, this assumption, which was also examined by Christof Koch and Francis CFF, is based more on the neuron connections of the mind than on the external mechanisms: always can be the same or not.
In fact, this assumption also enhances the importance of the pre-primary brain in the context of the visitation.
What is the next to these emotions?
This is because an ecclesiastical system, like fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activities.
"What we call fear" is therefore the mental state where we are when working memory (or consequences such as test reactions) is taken into account in the operation of the system of protection in the brain.
In this way, emotions are closely linked to areas of the brain that are specific to primates and especially to man.
In addition to the linguistic nature, the sense of perception differs to a subtle course, because words and grammar allow us to distinguish and distinguish between situations and to describe them to others, in addition to others.
On the other hand, Mr Damasio is of the opinion that emotions are derived from simple aspects of the body's mind and brain's mind, as well as Jaak University, which, however, focuses on the brain.
Since this network has not changed in the course of human evolution, it can be very easy to play a role in the universal senses of nature.
Obviously, I can't deny this, but I find it unproven.
It takes the view that what seems to be fear in rats and humans, in which case it is likely to be felt: How can it be ensured that rats and humans feel the same way when doing the same thing?
A cockroach escape in the event of an emergency, is he afraid too?
In my opinion, the same trend is not, in fact, a contradiction to the same one.
Although the neural breakdown helps further: the brain mass is similar to that of both the mammals and humans, the cockroaches do not have a brain.
But is the brain responsible for emotions?
Even if this is possible in relation to humans, how can we prove this in terms of rations?
I think the roads and other mammals, but even the cockroaches (who knows?) have their religions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from the land (as they are in the context of human consciousness's personal currents and languages), I am researching not only the emotional behaviour of the lytes but also the emotional emotions of the lytes.
In any case, this is a long-term conversation at the neural level, if measured at the same time at the same time as at the ribs and at the same time at the same time.
As far as the road is concerned, I do not know the language and the knowledge, nor the emotions, of course, I don't know if they exist.
This may seem to be a very brief attitude, but I'm more forward than ever going round and round.
I'm an ordinary emotionalist.
Plani, President of UEFA: A Time of Grace for Today and Ukraine.
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vassjunik said that preparations would fall under the responsibility of the President and of the President in particular.
"The government, in its UEFA Bordeaux decision to trust in Ukraine and its evidence, sees that they believe that Hungary is able to organise the European Championship together with Hungary," said Vasjunik.
"This, however, does not mean an apostasy for our country.
The job is just starting, and much more has to be done in both countries."

The late war of roses in the ex-husband of Meg Ryan - Oh Quaid: The two Hollywoods each seven years after their divorce are fighting a nasty fight in the public.
Ryan and the United States magazine InStyle were the first to comment on the reasons for his divorce last week: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, which caused a lot of pain."
Only after the divorce did he know that he was cheating on all women.
Our new press work on "Women", which tells the story of a murder, has been carried out on the spiritual death penalty, by Ryan's new press work on "Women".
ŒïDeid strongly responded to his call to a unfaithful husband, "Atrocious", he said to the 54-year-old New York Daily News newspaper, "that Meg is a smug, unsuspecting and conspiring the history of our relationship."
Moreover, it is "forgivable" that your 16-year-old fellows, Jack, repeatedly "reportedly resembles much pain and the change that divorce causes to a child."
While Ryan has been alone since the divorce, Quaid has been married again, and recently he has become a twin partner.
For this reason, his answer is closed with the following words: "My life goes on anyway.
"I am happy to know that I have an amazing family that is all the better."
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are falling apart.
In the first half of 2008, European airports and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one case-by-case scenario, in Germany, flights were not less than 50 per cent cheaper than in Germany.
The prices of airports and hotel rooms have once again become more favourable - so it is the result of a study by the American Express travel and financial service provider.
The company analysed its first half 2008 booking data and, after the first quarter price increase, identified a significant price fall in the second quarter.
After the price increase in the hotel market for years, the accommodation has become cheaper many places.
Between January and March, prices increased by an average of 6,9 % in 41 of 48 European cities investigated compared to 2007.
However, during the period from January to June, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the year of the year.
This trend was most obvious in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
This is why American Express sees it in its bad exchange rate, which "made it easier for the U.S. tourist to travel".
The number of hotel rates has a greater impact on financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than on industrial cities, such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavang.
In Norway, the increase in hotels of 26.3% is a European record.
There was also a marked change in the prices of flights in the first quarter.
Due to the cost of kerosene, passengers needed an average of 7.1 per cent more in the tourist sector than in 2007, and long-term high-cost flights cost 29,2 per cent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist-based flights decreased by an average of 1 percent compared to last year, but in business and first class, prices have shown only a very modest change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter by 13.6 per cent.
The price of German airports is estimated to have fallen by half.
The reason for the fall in prices lies, on one hand, in a moderate economic economy - the company claims to be a company.

There is a dark matter affecting the space probe transmission of space probes.
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing indiscriminateness among researchers for many years, affecting the duration of the space probes in the so-called swing-by manoeuvring process.
They fear that Albert Einstein‚Äôs general principle of relativity cannot be entirely correct.
The "Ulysses" space probe flew in space for nearly 18 years.
The near-to-frozen gas pipelines threaten the death of ice cream.
Scientists have been having trouble for many years with a mysterious phenomenon, the swing-by anomaly.
Wwing-by is the gravitational price manifestation of space probes, during which a single celestial body, such as the Earth, is combined in a gravitational field.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
However, what questions researchers have long since been admirable: Subjects in the United States are not fully functioning as would be expected under the Old Gravity Act.
Instead, there are abnormalities in the gear.
The probes are suddenly accelerating or slowing down.
No explanation for this effect has been found by physicists so far.
The phenomenon was crucified to swing-by anomaly.
Some experts believe that the general principle of relativity of Albert Ein, perhaps even, may not be entirely appropriate, which constitutes the compounding of the material as the compound of space.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist, of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong and attempts to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called background material discovered by the astronauts in the universe.
"For the anomaly, it can be a dark matter that is anywhere near the earth," says Adler.
Space scientists have only been able to find out about the existence of the matter for ten years.
It seems to have a gravity force that can be seen from the effects of other celestial bodies.
The matter itself, however, is completely invisible, i.e. no matter what electromagnetic radiation it is, it does not, in particular, emit or retaliate light.
Scientists estimate that a good fifth of the entire universe is made up of the dark material.
Tourists who have been kidnapped in the Union have been released.
After three days of imprisonment of their kidnappers, the tourists who have been taken away in all are free again, confirmed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United States.
The Sudanese man demands a ransom.
The release of hostages in a pre-emptive shooting is said to have killed six hostages in life.
In the south of Egypt, five German citizens were kidnapped.
Agreements on the ransom have already taken place.
Over and over again, Germans become the home of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists who have been taken away in his country are free of charge.
In agreement, this has been reported by Egyptian state media, Al-Arabija Arab Messengers and Italian media.
According to the Italian press release of Sky TG 24, U.S. Foreign Minister Franco Frattini said that the release was released: "Our fellows and other hostages were released.
We are currently examining the state of health", said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen and eight Egyptians are safe and secure - announced by the Egyptian State Road.
19 participants in the Vagyag expedition are said to be on their way to Kairoba by now.
The causes of the shooting before the release of the hostages are still covered by a drought: According to an Egyptian security officer, the hostages have already shown the courage to release the hostage when Sudan has made a modern act of influence.
"The problem is solved.
They accepted the ransom," he said.
"It was only about taking over the hostages when suddenly "the surprise happened."
Sudanese soldiers were shot six kidnappers in Sudan, Chad and Egypt on a daily basis, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 10 from Germany; the money should have been handed over to one of the German hostages.
"Aal-Masri al-Jom" newspaper, referring to a German mediator, has reported that the release of hostages is granted because kidnappers deny their own well-being.
It seems to me that hostages are released after they have paid the ransom.
Men are kept by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Switzerland was not in favour of the report.
"He's made acquitted" is the father-in-law's rape.
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
In the county of Cornwall, which is based in the village of Stithians, 57 years old, Michael Trerise aged 6 years old, after giving a statement of the attempt to give birth to him in principle of rape.
The Truro Court of Justice found out that he individually committed his stepdaughter, Stephen Randle, between the ages of five and seven years.
Trerise knew that he said, "I feel responsible for his death."
The trial concluded that Randle, at the age of 34, was killed in the middle of Plymouth town of Mutley on 1 April 2007.
He lived in Coventry as a minor child, Trerise bound and tied trash before having sex while his mother worked in a cheerleader.
Trere is divorced from his wife in 1980, and again he chose Cornwalt as his home.
The stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was discovered that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer in the National Trust Mental Protection Organisation, was persecuted by the twice a week's delusions of repeated violence.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife informed the court that Miss Randle, who recently had a passion for surfing and biking, said "emotional death" and "delegated life".
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his Plymouth stay.
It's just a bag of suffocating and suffocating.
Mr. Randle got involved with his daughter's stepfather, whose testimony he said, "I'm always bound and I'm stuck in the eye.
I didn't mind sexually.
I feel responsible for my own death."
Judge Pattoher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely remarkable fetist, and I'm sure it was terrible for him, especially when he was only seven years old.
It's the idea that the victim committed suicide.
However, even more reflective is the fact that if it did not, the case would probably never have been brought to trial."
The holder added: "I would like to point out how my parents felt about your daughter of a crime you committed over the years.
If this hadn't happened, it would probably have been a faithful, happy and happy woman."
The relevant DPO has been charged with the arrest of the DPO.
According to the information provided by the ICC, an officer of the State who has strictly denied confidential documents in June is being charged with an offence of professional secrecy.
He was seconded by a man from the Department of Defence when he left a couple of e-mails on a Waterlooba bus.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the least reasonable charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of an intentional offence.
According to a reporter sent to the BBC Department of Defence, Frank Gardner, the step was a surprise for many people in the Great Hall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would consider the case as an internal matter," he said.
An employee who cannot be identified has been charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Law.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has proposed that the Metropolitan Police represent the representative of the Office for his work on the Unified Intelligence Commission, which is of a rather sensitive nature.

The housing co-operatives pay for B &amp;B‚Äôs own property.
The United Kingdom‚Äôs housing corporations can account for an amount of GBP 80 million after the rescue of the Bradford &amp; Bingley bank.
The government spent USD 14 billion to protect its deposits at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be the sum of all the goods that use the money of the depositors, including 59 housing corporations.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Inhabitants (BSA), "it is annoying that companies and their members should be given to them."
The 14 billion important loans will finally be repaid after the loans of Bradford &amp; Bingley have been repaid.
However, in the meantime, the accrued interest is passed on to the financial company that uses the loans.
Financial Services' compensation system confirms to the BBC that 59 housing associations belong to them as well.
It is annoying that institutions that have been acting with caution so far... now have to pay the accounts of those institutions which have been much less cautious.
Office Coles, B.
We have learned that each of the companies has to pay the proportion to which the deposit is due, which accounts for 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amount will reach GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that the companies have to pay the first interest of 81 million dollars.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure to be unfair.
"It is alarming that those institutions must pay the accounts of the less prudent institutions, which acted with caution during the recovery of the housing market."
According to Bsa, none of the companies since they were operating in 19th century have been destroyed.
"We need to examine this case in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of money," Cole said.
Netting in 2009 shall be reported for 7 months at the end of this year.
In 2010, a total interest should be charged, which could even be the current two times.
As housing co-operatives are self-sufficient entities, they will have to pay the account to the members, either through the accounts or through their depositors.
The price of milk increases by five cents per litre.
In the second place, people need to pay more for the change.
The One-Year Sugar Company announced that from Monday, it will increase the wholesale price of milk by five more cents per litre.
This year, this is the second price increase since the February two pennies increase and after a review by a consultant company.
Distributors decide whether to continue to increase prices to consumers.
Before February, the average wholesale price of sugar in the second quarter of 2002 was the same as in 2002.
Requests from an EU Member of the European Union to travel to Bangladesh to defend himself freely.
The Supreme Court rejected the request for protection of the former Member of the European Parliament, Sheikh Hasina, who is entitled to be released, which means that he may be released when he returns to the country.
Your lawyer told me that the court refused to defend him on the stand on the charge that 50 000 takats ($9,700) were expelled from a businessman by his parliamentary representative in the time of his death (‚Ç¨9,700).
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges brought against it.
Sheikh Hasina, an old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released from prison this month against a bail.
Sheikh Hasa needs to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, Awami League, demands that the Government of the State supported by the United States of America now be given full freedom.
According to the reports, although it was conditionally granted the right to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the terms of the leave of leave that it is possible to maintain its right to return to the country when it is returned.
Lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appeal court.
"The Board of Appeal rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, that he was not needed, has now been temporarily released and is taking part in medical treatment abroad," we learned from Rafique and Huq.
"We appeal against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyer's arguments, he needs to be protected on leave so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awam League on the day said that Sheikh Hasina is expected to be home after 17 October.
Last year, he was arrested for taking over power by the government of the United Nations, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia are all advocating all charges against them.
There are concerns about the African police vaccination programme.
According to the United Nations, almost 9000 children in Afghanistan are excluded from the recently organised polio vaccination programme for Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations organised vaccination operations in the United States.
However, they said that for security reasons they were unable to reach some of the children living in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the current state of life.
According to a United Nations spokesperson, however, the Taliban have promised: they are not afraid to attack or prevent the executing officer, thousands of staff.
He refused to appeal to the rieskyb in relation to the I Plus.
BskyB's appeal against the decision of the Committee on Legal Affairs, which has refused to give rise to an interest in the use of live television and ITV.
The CJEU required BIKYB to reduce its share in the ILV from 17.9% to 0.7%.
In the past, the Committee has determined that BSCA‚Äôs share of the company is a threat to competition and that it is an unfair influence over the company.
The BSkyB used its share in 2006, and this effectively prevented the TTL - which has been changed to Virgin Media - from buying ITV.
In May 2007, the Tribunal reported that the share purchased by BBYB from the ITV jeopardises the ITV function, thereby encouraging the Legal Affairs Committee to open an investigation.
The Director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, the consumer groups and Ofcom supervision have all opposed the abuse.
BSYB argued that it was unreasonable and inappropriate for BSYB to make up for its IC participation - in particular, given that BSYB had stated that it would be unable to give up its right of authorisation.
Another investigation into the U.S. Public Prosecutor's Office's case.
The U.S. Public Prosecutor has appointed a Special Prosecutor to investigate the threat of the U.S. Public Prosecutor in 2006.
The action followed the fact that the report made by the Chief Superintendent of the Court of Justice on the matter criticises the decisions of government officials.
The report was condemned by the Presidents of the United States, the Lawyers and the former Public Prosecutor, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state's attorneys would be deprived of political protection.
Ms. Danehy, Special Prosecutor, is going to investigate whether the officials in the investigation have tried to stop justice by lying.
"The serious charges relating to a possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been investigated", said Superintendent Glenn Fine.
One of his main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor who has the power to prosecute witnesses.
The series started with the removal of a public prosecutor from the U.S. Public Prosecutor's file in 2006.
At the time, they said that the state's attorneys were dismissed due to their poor performance.
However, it was later discovered that the Public Prosecutors received nothing worse than many of their fellow citizens.
Some public prosecutors have been involved in criminal proceedings against high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others have refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against the Democrats.
The state's attorneys are investigating on behalf of the government and carrying out legal proceedings.
They may be rescued at any time, but for political reasons they may not be removed from their position.
At the time, the then head of the judicial file, State Attorney Alberto Gonzales, became the victim of attacks for the relief and finally resigned.
Many other officials of the judicial file have also given up their resignation.
The Chief Inspector's report strongly praised his role in the case. He says that the Public Prosecutor is "responsible" for dismissals, "responsible" for his role in command, and "responsiblely detracted himself" from the process.
Officials, including Karl Rove, senior Bush's former assistant, are dealing with the fact that he did not cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epistle is recognised as Meat Loaf.
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive credit for the elecous hymn of "Bat Out Of Hell" at the Q Awards Awards Awards Award Program.
The singer, who next year is going through a special grand prize at the London Festival, said it was an honor to honor him.
The five-minute, fifty-four-foot song of Meat Loaf, 19th, was a song for the album of the musical success garden.
Coldplay received most of the nominations for this year's awards, and they were listed in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, says: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres of art, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is one."
The song that Jim Steinman made was a very loud voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song started with an almost two-minute instrument break.
He showed up in 1979 as a minor, and he got to the 15th place in the hit-and-run.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" album has been present for nearly one year on the hitlers, and has now sold more than 40 million copies of it.
Meat Loaf - actually known as Marvin Lee Aday - has been working on medical problems lately. Among other things, in March, she had surgery because of her heart rhythm disorder, after she collapsed on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute amniotic disease.
Of course, there is a cyst in the tone.
A unpopular metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may be sold for sale.
New York City has thousands of roads, tours and other means of escape, some of which are common, others perform purely practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and residents living here today are unlikely to know where Extra Place is, most of the time because they have never heard of it.
The street is in East Village, and it's heading north from the Second Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long and much more so than a dusty alley than a main route.
No street codes.
Practically, you cannot find it on a standard map.
However, on the street, there are blinds.
There is, for example, the building of the Valon Bay, the most recently built Main Street building.
He wants to rediscover Extra Place again, and he wants to make sure that he can make it to the new buildings' shops and boutiques more recently.
One of the street hangers is the neighbors who live here today, who was held by the mantle in the ass, that this was the only remains of the past before the moment was refurbished.
However, the owner of the street, the town's building inspection and development department, should not be touched.
During this month, during a meeting of the Regional Area Management Committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal to buy the street.
At the same time, the Committee would prefer that the street remain in the city and has requested a new plan for the next month, reports Susan Stetz, head of the 3rd Central District.
"There are so many areas in the city's possession, and we want Extra Place to remain the city," he said.
"There may be proposals for refurbishment and refurbishment that Avalon may make, but we also want to allow it to be available to the public."
A month ago, Utlon Bay announced that it wanted to re-energise the little street and provide accommodation, some of which would be used by a coffee shop, which would be expected to rent an area.
The idea that Vault Bay would buy the street was first published at this month's session.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson at Valon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, it does not require its possession.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this covert alley and turn it into a common public place," said Avalon Bay, adding that the city has proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Office for the Conservation of the Sites, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for the development of buildings and not for its modification.
In comparison to Bowery, Extra Place is not much of a significant place to be compared to its favorite neighbor.
In some cases, in 1802, he was given the name "who's land" when Philip Minthorne's great estate was given up among countless children, and no one needed the narrow countryside.
The punk-rock monument, closed in 2006, the back exit of the CBGB is open to Extra Place, and the street is probably the most significant that was taken on the cover of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in 19 recent years.
"Tele was full of garbage, dress-dresses, barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some people, including bloggers, who write about how they owned the size of East Village, are opposed to Extra Place. They argue that all of these public property, however modest, must be known to the public.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city, and which must be left alone.
Jeremiah Mooss, a writer of the book Siralmak, called "The Great New York of Jeremiah: A bitter nostalgic of the town's death", put forward on a day a part of the story about Extra Place, which appeared in the article entitled "The New Yorker" in the "Principal Speech" of the "The New Yorker".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small back road, which is still dark today, which is bordered by rust, iron-made storage doors and slatted windows, and where the winds carry one week's notices in the windows."
The street, apart from some, looked the same a few nights ago.
He ran across the street on the back side of the back, which used to go to the CBGB, and now he belongs to a higher-priced shop, which is now in place.
On the walls, it was graffiti, and a empty, 0.75 liter gallon of walrus bottle was lying next to an abandoned, fresh newspaper pen.
Many have said that there is a way to remember the Extra Place, but they think that there is a need for renovation.
s said that some people underestimate the current state of belief in him.
"I have spent every year of my life in dark, bitter and disgusting places," he said.
A debate on dual-language education: A continuous language environment for the English language community.
The student in this section is the subject of a discussion on the opinion of the candidates on dual-language education, Bruce Whoer and Lance T..
Lance T. Izumi, who is an associate of the book "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need access to education" at the Institute for Public Policy Research in the Pacific Ocean and the Director of Education Studies in California.
It is not easy to vote in favour of the Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Oma's proposals on education are also included.
According to Obama's campaign, "Afro-American and Spanish lip learners are significantly less likely to get their degrees than the white students," and that is true.
In order to overcome such differences, Obama's education plan should include "transitual dual-language education" for learners.
Obama, the question of whether the commitment of multilingual education to education, which puts the emphasis on education in non-English, is overturning the concern of the fight against major conditions of service.
Take, for example, the General Agreement on Six Street Prep in the region of Los Angeles.
Most of his students are lipless and low.
More than a third of the students - who have recently arrived - have learned the language.
Nevertheless, 100% of fourth graders achieved excellent results at the 2008 state math exam.
It is also impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have performed well in the English language and literature exam.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the device Obama would otherwise have achieved.
Sixth Street places the emphasis on repetition, exercise, continuous assessment of the roles and rejection of objections.
And this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikkels, Director of Sixth Drive, the principle of education is the "full integration" of students studying English in the language environment.
The essence of the assessment method is the sole use of the English language in the teaching of other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to multilingual education, said: "We've made a huge success in saying that if someone were to enter a classroom, they wouldn't notice who the student was who 12 months ago had changed from the new Mexico City."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would one of the following be an opportunity for the other schools, such as the Six Street Prep, to be given a major degree in lips and English?
The progress achieved by the school should be confirmed, but it is because of the education policy of its own party (the National Educational Communities have been supporting non-voting education for a long time) and because they themselves are consistently in favour of non-lingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although it agrees that immigrants should learn English, Obama has recently made an inestimable statement about this issue when he said that people should not worry about the law 'except for what it was about'.
Instead, he said, "They should be able to get the kids to speak Spanish."
Obama really wants to make a difference between the problems, and he should really study the models that are either, instead of looking down and ignoring them.
The price of oil fell steeply in the economy due to exhausted prices.
On Monday, the prices of apples fell on Monday because of the risks that the US financial market rescue plan will not be able to provide for the economy.
The commodity securities returned to USD 99,80 in the New York Commercial Exchange by seven per cent.
It's more than $20 per barrel last Monday.
In the last two months, the commodity divisions have been reversed by Wall Street financial confusion and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached USD 145,29 per vessel in July, at the beginning of this month almost USD 90 per vessel were recovered before being re-emphasised by the enormous uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, the concerns reinvigorated the investors even after the Congress leader announcements: this weekend, the economic rescue action is taking place, which is the most important thing in life.
The facts have been set aside, and the financial world is not over yet.
In the recent events of the emerging crisis, Citigroup is turning up the Wachovia Corporation banking business, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments state the European Financial Conglomeration, the Fortis, in one country.
According to the analysis of Barclays Capital, this weekend's negotiations may seem to be "like, the rescue operation has failed to bring about the atmosphere's mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that the demand for goods, such as oil, will also change.
"The future of the stock market, the interest rates and the foreign exchange market has become generally uncertain," he wrote, one of the analysts of Deutsche Bank for the  ¬´  ¬´  ¬´ ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê ‚Äê
"We believe that the commodity market will not be circumvented by the "threat".
The most important issue in terms of supply is the extent to which the "disease" of the United States is transmitted to the whole world, especially to Brazil."
As a result of the slowdown in economic growth, oil consumption, banks' analytical deficits decreased from their expectations for the year to next year by 20%, reducing the forecast for 2009 for oil and gas prices.
With the second gorge, the team set up a record for the next one.
After more than eight seasons spent in the Jets game than any other Shaun Ellis, who played in the defensive position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second half of the show on the day that Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational crisis.
"I've never seen that before," said Ellis.
The second one began after that the game of the Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully in line with the dark ones in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback 12-yards touchdown pass gave Laveranues Coles a laveranues pass. This was a good start for an afternoon in which their improved cooperation has improved significantly.
Favre gives Coles two more touchdown passes in this respect, but also when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I wasn't sorry about the trouble," said Favre about all the passports he gave Coles.
"A lot of good players.
We were well aware of communication with each other, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing, the protection will show the remote control of the Cardinals, Kurt Warnert.
A cornerback position player Darrelle Revis caught a bad pitch and threw it back with 32 yards worth of touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety player touched another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, the linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing match in the match.
However, when the Cardinals finished the stake 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely had a 20-yard field to kick in, and then the 34:0 result was replaced by the 34:0 result.
That was the best result the Sots has achieved in a quarter of a year.
When they asked Jets's coach, Eric Mangit, to describe the game's jazz position, he said, "The second or third?"
When they told him that both - in the third party, the Cardinals said 11 points that the Jets did not agree - Mangini said: "I must tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed more than the third quarter.
We have gained a lot of points in the short term."
The rested Gebrselassie beats his own world record.
The etiop Haile Gebrselassie again showed why many people consider it to be the best mid- and long-distance traveler ever used when in Berlin on Sunday he broke his own world record, and he was the first to pass 42.2 kilometers in 2 hours 4 minutes.
On a comfortable flat track, in a time of 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds in his earlier result of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie's career in 26 other areas has brought about a world record in such a number of areas that from 1500 meters to marathons, he has won or reached the world's championships in all over the world.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon with fear - which, by looking back on it, has proved to be a little too early - that air pollution would make the asthma problem even more serious.
Returning to the Place for the marathon.
Almost in perfect circumstances - during the day, in fact at 9¬∞C, in the last 13¬∞C - won Gebrselassie on Sunday, with incredible speeds of 2 minutes 56 seconds per km.
Since the marathon has not been launched recently, such as Gebrselassie and the Kenyan Paul Tergat have turned to long distances, marathons have been reduced by more than two minutes in recent years since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa was awarded a 2:06:05 in Berlin in 1998.
After the day's victory, Gebrselassie told the reporter that two months ago, his two footsprays had been cramped and he couldn't train for two weeks.
I understand that during the rest of the day, he got drunk and he didn't rust.
"I'm so happy," he said to the reporters at Gebrselassie.
"it all worked out perfectly.
One month ago I started training again, and today I had no doubt, but everything was definitely fine."
He has received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, Eastern African rivals - who use too much of the tools in their competitions, usually many world-renowned marathons, think of them as if they were running in a race and present world-renowned competition spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in the long run.
Gyrselassie met the criterion by four Kenyan Iranians on Sunday at 1:02:4:4.
The two leading Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, show the rhythm to Gebrselassie, after the rammers are exhausted.
Not much more than 4.8km before the end of Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprintttel, who in fact was worth 2:05:36, with 5 minutes at his best.
He also means that he does not know what he is doing.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, has closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory at 2:19:19.
The balconies of the British Paula Radcliffe hold 2:15:25 with time.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London marathon with the experience 2:24:14.
It was the third marathon that he participated in.
The competition was well accounted for: for the first time, he allowed the Ethiopians and the Kenyans to advance a group of four, and to take the lead, and then, after about 30 km, he left.
The Ethiopian Askle Tafa Magersa was aimed at the second time at a time of 2:21.31, while the Kenyan Helena Kiprop became the third with a 2:25:01 performance.
A lonely town, the courage and the challenges of the blacks.
There is a quiet town in the Greatest Orlado - some of everything that is glittering, loud and huge - where the courage and complexity of African-American life experience have been born.
Eatonville, the first pure black town that was integrated into the country and which was the home of Zora Neale Hurston's home in the early days, is now not as simple as it said in 1935: "The five lakes, three ridges, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guavas and two towns, without a prison."
Now it's a asylum.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora Festival, which is held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female journalist of the Harlem renaissance.
Of course, in many respects, it is a city which has been described and made a tourist sight, which is also included in the Florida guide book issued by the project of the Soviet Scriptures of the Emergency Age.
As independent as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston, according to one report, Florida's black people often refused to share their real thoughts with the real people, who are so few people that they know they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the same year that the President-in-Office, Barack Obama, advises me about the nature of the matter, many of us here are unsuspecting about the looks of the outsiders.
"Let us take great care to see how our story is told," reported 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"That's the way to say it."
They're all going to be here with a paradox of victory and fighting.
At the same time, a major model of black outreach is a significant model, but it is an almost major community where poverty indicators reach the national average of doubles.
In the meantime, it is a intellectual bonnet, in part an example of the American slavery, which is, sometimes, watched, easily praised, suburban, urban, black, which lies behind the oaks.
It is no surprise that the people here are both proud and defensive at the same time.
A picture of Eatonville has been developed and Zora has been important (this is what everyone calls Hurston).
In true, strong dialected books - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937) - he introduced his hometown to the world.
The Florida travel guide changed the city, which is on Route 17, which leads to Florida's long-forgotten centre of black history and human drama in one of its places.
Hurston, who was brave both in life and in literature, as well as the drumming, opened his readers to Eatonville's first-in-command, Joe Clarke, as well as to the more reliable spheres.
wrote: "From the road to the right we can find modern public schools, brown is based on a thin body, carefully kept up to date with courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller takes care of, although he can write and read."
He mentioned the new husband of the widow Dash, and he wrote that Lee Glenn "supervised all kinds of drinks, and anything that might be necessary for temporary accommodation."
Thus, in some cases, Hurston has linked Eatonville with autonomy, but at the same time also with illiteracy, remandation and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's manual was presented differently.
This description is really not correct.
"Zora said things as they were," reports the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls.
He added: "That's what some people didn't like."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living isolated, who often visited home, his family moved to Florida Jackson.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston visited the city, he was generally uninvited in a violent Chevrott, smoking and long-sleeved place where people are still proud of their dignity today.
Most people were fascinated by him, said Franklin, but a lot of people were fascinated by him.
"People are always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the other side of Lake Saberia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, in fact, he added, "Not for much longer."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published again.
It seemed that most of the world, along with Eaton, had forgotten about it, too.
Although he was ever a popular writer, Langston Hughes's contemporary partner, and the only woman at Barnard College in the 1920s was put to death in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
There were no significant equations or large, public readings in Eaton.
"I don't think they understood how much he's enriched the world, or what he's left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston theory, published in 2003.
The time of arrival was 1 :00.
The Orange County officials sought to build a five-track route across the city for the two-band main road, the Kennedy Highway, which played an important role in the life of the world.
The widespread Orl√°v has already penetrated the States by connecting Interstate 4 motorways along the border of the city.
The suggestion was when Eaton was actually after a very bad period of time.
Among other things, forced integration has put an end to the relative idyllic separation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battles of racial confusion have pleased the community with hatred.
"At that time a team of white people came over, and they saved people sitting on the side of the road with an orange and other things," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died here.
They threw a cane out of a car."
In addition, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court to provide for a violent integration of the Supreme Court, in which he said about the decision of the "Brow v. Board of Education": "it is more offensive than respecting my own property."
Today's residents say that the desegregation of children in the same area was, in some respects, mandatory, weakened the co-ordination of eatons and undermined the confidence of the people.
"The black kids used to kill them - this I remember - the man took over his teacher at night and also at night," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, Managing Director of Nonprofit, the "Professional Society of Eatonville".
"This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he said.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a true teacher - I mean, there were natural differences between us," said Nathi.
However, many other human rights aids are in the hands of Zora Neale Hurston - in black writers, self-sufficient artists and artists who stand up to prejudices, as he did, with such a beautiful confidence and ranks as: "How can he not deprive himself of the joy of my company!
This is incomprehensible to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker wandered away to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to support his return of his reputation.
A few years later, the booksellers were given a film written by Robert E. Hemen≈ü, a recognised Hursto biography, which once again improved the image of the Americas.
The road construction project would have started just as Eatonville's most famous girl was again in the centre of attention.
This time, Hurston's neighbors thought he was a lifeguard.
In 1988, the community started organising a Hurston festival to show what the county would do with its main route.
Thousands of fans have arrived for the two-year opening event, and many are returning to the occasion every January.
A few years later, the county stopped proposing for a road trip.
"For the purpose of the five-programming of the main road, the community has been reintroduced, linked to full speed, which means genuine civil protection," said Nathiri.
Boyd put it more simply, "Zora is holding Eaton even."
The victory over the road project helped to change the city's image of itself.
More and more people outside the country have appeared, such as Lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began to come here in March and the locals have revalued the past.
Eatonville was included in the national syndicate in 1998.
In 2006, the new, uniform (logined from Hurston) library, the re-energised and swept Kennedy √∫tt√∫t, was published in 2006.
Even though it still remains the owl of Florida: it is not just ten km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a remote street in the middle of a summer; it is as sweet as when the 27 mothers of the 1880s founded it.
(90% of today‚Äôs population)
They are still taking precautions against the aliens who come here looking for the history and knowledge of Eatonism.
Most people are allowed permission to search, and some things, such as the oldest raccoon in Eatonville, which are painted by a white man and the black people on the ground, should not be taken.
In that regard, many, including the self-aware teacher Jones, who is particularly attracted to it, fear that their separate community might be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston World has become more and more extensive, the home town's shelter has grown in growth.
Young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own species: wonderful, with his father and with all things, better, worse, as proud, creative, busy, as well as stupid and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in the United States.
An honest civil link is quieting out of the words of Franklin's brother, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to work with the local government or the state department after graduation of the college, which thinks they need help.
And it seems that the younger ones have been able to correctly describe Eatonskaya, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel through here think this city is nothing but the rest," said Alondra Kenon, after the service one day.
"But if someone stops and takes a little time to get to know his history, it's a really nice city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing has changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the newspaper deposits and the huge television billboards on Times Square, I wouldn't notice that a storm is playing a very special role.
Of course, they would realize that the bankers and hedge fund managers who control New York have been living the most difficult days of their lives since 19199 with the brand-new bee-shaped branches over their heads.
The couriers are still running a rubber tea truck on the sidewalks, carrying trays loaded with muffins to the breakfast meetings.
Still a second mouthful of men snooping around the cocoons, carrying human mules as they are forty-five times as thin as they are, which cross their shoulders, giddy with a rubber hook.
The office workers are still in line for their sweet bakery bakery on the sidewalk for meals, and still still have a taxi between 4 and 7 on a daily basis.
I didn't feel that there would be any kind of emergency until Thursday afternoon, despite all the news, I didn't decide to start a new bank account.
I was also planning on doing this during the afternoon's rest in my JP Morgan Case bank's local interest, but I already had 20 people in line.
Not at the bank repository window where money can be collected or paid, but at the customer service desk where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store and where new customers open a bank account.
Many people before me - I learned later from Starr, the "ordered" banker - came up with the same intention as I did before me.
On the other hand, however, they have already taken out their money in small banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Landn Island.
Cash was taken out of fixed-declaration banks (such as housing associations), credit institutions and small-town savings banks that only operate in the United States and are supposed to treat each of them as family members.
Over the past year, 15 of them have gone silent.
Over the past few days, the bank of Moscow Mutual, a bank with a bank of $3 billion worth of dollars, has been put into bankruptcy, and when the New Yorkers left for the evening on Friday night, another bank, the Wachovia, made a bank deposit of $440 billion.
In front of me, office workers and shop workers, in fear of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be safe, to the bank that makes most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people in New York have recently become experts in finance.
A woman on her local Chinese store phone said she was bankrupt about Lehman Brothers Bank and her big-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were reporting to a desk.
Now, in the middle of my apartment, he changed the same-dressed, fifty-year-old caretaker's topic, not now about you and Angelina, or about my province, as we always do.
He said to me, when I was in the U.S., "I've made all the money I've saved in cash.
I've changed, I won't risk."
Muslim tombs were girded while Austria was on the right hand side of the left hand side of the bank.
Heinz-Christian Strache, right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, right-wing Belgian Party, from Vlaams Fall, took part in a statement in Antwerp on 17 January 2008, on Thursday, 17 January 2008, which was presented by the organization called "Vehicles Against the Space of Islam".
They have developed signs that mimic some of the traffic signs, which have shown a number of mosques drawn through the line.
According to the rules, the extremes on the far right are responsible for the attack on Australian Muslim cemeterys, which took place on the same weekend, when the parties on the far right make significant progress in the national legislative elections.
More than 90 people for over 90 years have been seriously hurled in the traun cemetery next to L√µz, sometime on the evening and this evening, according to the police, it's an operation.
The unsubs are drawing a spell on a few bodies, such as the Great Star, but, according to the investigators, they have only tried to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked to the elections in any way.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic community said that I was "in a deep mood" in the wake of the sound of the coup d'√©tat, which happened shortly before the end of Ramadan in the Muslim Republic.
In the meantime, Austria is conducting a conscience test following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the right-hand language of the political regime is left.
The two parties on the far right, which received almost 30% of the votes, have been designated by the People's Party and the Alliance for the future of Austria, for a highly anti-announced law, and some of their slogans have been awarded to their peoples as haters.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Free Party with more than 18% of the votes cast, expressed his opposition to the campaign against the chiefs and the burks, and his dissatisfaction with the allegedly related food of Islam.
In the last round of the party, he talked about "the European Union", which will help to prevent Islam from being strengthened.
Both sides want to ban the construction of mosques and mermaids, arguing that it is a political expression of the Islam of Austria and Europe in progress.
Public opinion surveys and, in some cases, the change was due to the large majority of young voters, who are concerned about their future in the European Union, directly after the elections that have won the best.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a trip abroad.
Garry Glittert, a child who has been sentenced to sex rape, is a rock star prohibited by the Court of Justice from travelling in France and Spain.
The judges have decided to stay with Glitter for six months, with a six-month ban on informing him of his intention to travel through Canada to the control authorities.
The police have obtained a travel ban on a Thursday, after submitting evidence to the Court of Justice of cases of rape against children against Glitter.
Glitter, in fact known as Paul Gadd, did not participate in the Supreme Court meeting of Ashford in the field, but was represented by Corker Bingo's lawyer.
One speaker said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the court of the Court of Justice of the Assford Magistrates filed an application on behalf of the Court of Justice for the prevention of travel to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd doesn't appear."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because he commits this law to those involved in the registration of sex offenders.
You should inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It also requires you to notify the police at least one day before your scheduled leave.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The police in the field told me that they do not want to talk about specific cases of Glitter in Hungary and possible location.
We found out from the field police spokesperson: "The Kent police are doing everything in their power to protect children both within and abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to check if you do not leave the United Kingdom, because here there is a comprehensive system for us to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the police is to protect Kent's population. By close cooperation, we continuously monitor the rights of persons in the register of sex offenders and those living in the country in order to minimise the potential risks to the general public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, spent 27 months in a prison in Vietnam for the rape of a 10 and 11-year-old girl.
After his leave, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have flown a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The authorities of the world did not pass on the passport, so they flew to Hong Kong.
The authorities of the PRC were not allowed to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where the U.S. Department and the officials of the Finnish Immigration Service were arguing that they would return to Great Britain.
On 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court in West London, Uxbridge, because, as requested by the Scotland Yard, he was entered in the register of perpetrators of a sexual offence under a court order.
Glitter spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possession of photographs of the rape of the population in the United Kingdom.
According to a Ministry of Home Affairs, Mr Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, was pleased and pleased that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on stage because I want to introduce the image on a personal basis."
No formula, no hairdressers, no dance shoes.
From the point of view of a flamenco master's staff, without prejudice to the power of action: to get to know the ordinary face of the dancers.
On the one hand, the teacher.
On the other hand, the ordinary man is on the other hand.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate moments away from the audience, when we can take a personal move, we can grasp the depth of a visual look, or we can appeal to the beauty of the unstantiated artist's unstantiated, untruthful but expressive hand of the artist.
In his photo by the German G√ºnther Internet Flamenco-pople, the students, dancers, and guitarists were given the opportunity to learn from this very common side of the world.
Through the photographs, the specific iconography of falmenco is presented in different aspects.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Flamenco Nature, "recognises the international importance of famenco every day", believes that the creator, adding that Flamenco-pepole "could not be present, as the images show that these images are not typical of artists.
These people on the street are artists who are capable of showing passion, kindness, joy to the stage... and preying on the scene.
On stage photography, however, is not suitable to grasp their personality.
Their staff and nature live in the deepest depths of their beings.
I would have liked to create an inner atmosphere that allows me to attribute the spirit of the greats of the Falmenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival was set up in Bauer in 1987 with a long way in which a smart camera prepared portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers.
Thanks to the camera and the subject, these portraits create the most modern photography.
However, the application of the various stylistic tools is disrupted by the traditional imagery and suggests modernity. The following thought faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of the flaming: "This is a traditional music with roots, which, however, varies from day to day and is always inviolable."
It's not the story, it's not the song or the music itself, it's the personality of the artist, it's the character of the scene.
In the days, the guiding principle of the works that can be seen in the gallery is the search for encountering the essentials, the artistic magic, which can be seen through the ways of perception, existence and display.
The familiar forms of flamenco, including George El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, are the names of this six-tenth year-old public collection.
The project has also become a flamenco-antheology, which is also used to publish an album of the portraits presented at the exhibition.
For two years, the passion of the portraits has been linked to the repeating of this article by the series "Sport project" (Sportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsportsports.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people differs slightly, the photographer adds: "I love people taking pictures, getting to know them and entering their lives for a longer or longer time.
In my opinion, the most difficult stage of the photograph is the portrait.
People you meet, people you meet, people you know, people you don't know, or people who just want to take pictures for a few minutes.
But under these circumstances, as a joker, I always try to realize my thoughts.
The exhibition, which has been selected from the portraits of the contemporary famenco, entitled Flamenco people, will be published in the Eminent Gallery until 16 May at the same time as Alameda de H√§rculesz.
According to Vargas Llosas, the novel on which he is working is "a strong blindness".
The scene and the action are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing a new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Ckent, who lived 20 years in Congo and in Amazon.
The author who is also eligible for the Literary Nobel Prize, Mr. Hayview Segovia, admitted at the event that his current work is "a strong blindness" and "what it shows is that there is no need to write" the novel.
"If I'm smarter, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it, at some point at the end of the day" - he closed his speech with these words at the festival of mind, thought and opinions, which in the town of Aqueut welcomed the people of writers, historians and journalists, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "City andats" was one of the most outstanding participants in the age of literature, and he also succeeded in his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Place Award, a novel by Dickens "Our Common One", voted by the participants for an old edition.
A dedicated audience welcomed by Felix Romeo. It was soon overdue for the public, during which the author of the apocalypse told us with a spectacular reminder and a great deal of humor how his passion for reading developed his particular adventure and the desire for life was written; how to overthrow the lack of inspiration with an unorthodox method of writing, with regular provisions, with a lot of help and with rewrite; how he created his own belief in Faulk, Victor Hugo and Annane Dumas, and how his monuments are based on stories.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it is impossible to measure or show whether books change our lives, but he added: "I think that literature is a mere pleasure or a social experience", as it affects people and makes them think, so he asked the writers not to let the seduction and responsibility for their duties.
Due to the current weather, the Pozoblanco's turnout, the horse bullfights are also behind.
Traditionally, the horse-breeding horse-breeding campaign in Pozoblanco was decommissioned yesterday, after the future horse-breeding torpedoes found the arena's territory inappropriate for the debate.
As a consequence, the Committee decided to abstain from the bull fight by the agreement of Ferm√≠n Boh√≥rquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern√°ndez.
The season of the ceremony was thoroughly ruined by the weather difficulties, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, he left the second bull fight because of the incident.
The future main characters, Jos√© Luis Moreno, Curro D√≠az and Juan Bautista Castilblac√≥, would have worked with the bulls of Castilblac√≥.
So only a bullfight was held on the afternoon.
Daniel Luque, the winner, took three sets of trophies home. He was taken on his shoulder after the refined and ethical struggle.
In the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante's two bulls gave him a lot of credit and as a trophy, but this was more to the audience than to his own performance.
However, El Juli followed, which contributed to the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
With the second bull, after a comfortable ride, most of the population has been able to get it out of the sod.
He knows that a two-tonne hash truck tried to run away from the control.
4:00 in the morning, 50 minutes.
The district police are conducting traffic checks in the area of Armenia (General).
The authority will stop a van that travels between the two of them. Passengers will try to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hash, however, was not noticeable.
The detectives pursued the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested, and identified under the name A.A.J. - said the Finnish Government Department of Home Affairs.
The prisoner is accused of trafficking in drugs and forgery of documents.
The case took place in an administrative area in Armenia, where the staff of the √Ålava Forgalmi Supervisory Authority carried out a traffic check on the N-1 motorway.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, gave in to the process and then left the place of control.
Detectives have been tracked down, and then the vehicle has stopped at a stop-by-pass, and its passengers have fled from the motorway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police took one of them in the last place, and after examining the Iveco Daily branded truck, he booked a shipment of 2178 kg of hash.
Gaskets that fill the vehicle part of the vehicle have been transported by the police to undergo a more thorough examination and to control the drug.
In addition to the verification, it has been established that the vehicle's false registration plate does not match the data contained in the vehicle's paper, and that proceedings against the prohibited person are also being brought for counterfeiting of documents.
The Basque Regional Police Department is conducting the investigation, which is aimed at arresting another suspect, who, as we have mentioned, has escaped from the motorway, and at determining the origin of the seized animal.
The 28-year-old accused, A.A.J., was transferred to the police for the conduct of the necessary interrogations, and within some of them court proceedings were initiated.
She has been arrested because she was using the medicine.
Heather Locklear actress, from Melrose Place, was given a special holiday in Santa Barbara (California) this weekend, because she had always wanted to use the medicine.
One witness said that he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with a few manoeuvres - he said to People magazine as one of the spokespersons of traffic supervision in California.
The witness seems to have pushed the gas around 16:00 30 hours "to the floor, sneezed the engine, refused to leave the parking lot in front and back, and repeatedly passed through the sun."
Sooner or later, the witness, who was never able to identify the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby freeway and get out of the car.
He also warned the police because "he was worried about the life of Lexlear".
When the police arrived, the actress was sitting in her car, which completely paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
"It seemed like a mess," so the police took him to a drug and test center.
According to a police spokesperson, the woman was cooperative and the alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded. The spokesperson also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, she was thought to be under the influence of a Locklear medicine.
Lockleta was arrested and suspected of driving under I.D., transported to a local prison around 19 hours later, where he was released a few hours later.
Lonear came out two months ago from a Santhos in Arizona, where he maintained his anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the US (United Left) Andalus Federation to deal with the Silva issue.
Mr Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the United Kingdom's representative today stated that the Regional Federation of the Revolution will decide on the matter of the former Youth and Sport Council of the Government of Seville, Mr Silva.
"In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this matter is a matter within the competence of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the method that the party should use in its capacity as a member of the Seville City Council.
Second, the President of the Council pointed out that, in investigating any irregularities that Silva may have committed, the "transparency" should be borne in mind: "At all times, at all times, there has been a lack of clarity over such matters."
He added that training is part of "the strict code of ethics for public citizens."
"Must blood", the epic work of Garci.
It was inspired by Jos√© Luis Garci, a work by Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s's National Epizoogy, who is causing the Spanish to rise in Mayu blood, which, with its budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest piece of his graphics.
Accordingly, in the work of the well-known novelist, the director has always longed to illustrate a flood and a social analysis, and today, with the help of Quim Guti√©rrez and Paula Echevarr√≠a, Garci told the cast-up public audience.
The more than two and a half hours of Mayan blood is presented in the movies on Friday, and later, the Telmardi mini will be used as a minimum for up to four hours.
All thanks to Esperanza Aguirrina, who had given her three years ago from Madrid to give a memorial to the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on May 2. Garci accepted the request on condition that the basis of the story was given by the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets in their entirety were a special opportunity for the Government of the Autonomous Republic of Madrid and Garci: he could present with an old-fashioned virtue and a costume "the insatiable people, who were wrongly led by a bad leader, because the struggle for independence has put the country in a huge deficit with the King of Fedinand VII," he said.
However, the director expressed his remorse for which the blood of the liver could not count with the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms, which was more than double-knifely fired, and which forced him to skip some of the scenes from the scenario, which, as in many other cases, is combined with Horacio Valc√°rsel.
So, the director of the Re-opening has usually turned to his working method, and he has taken up the scenes with those who started the routines before the shooting. Casting was not, because Garci thinks it's a "flame", and because, as he said, "the director's profession is part of the theatre and cinema to know what's going on in the industry we're working on."
More characters of liver blood, such as Miguel Rellan, Carlos Larra√±aga or Fernando Guilli√©n Cuervo, did not first come forward.
Garci - who may be proud of four Oscars and an Oscar prize - thinks that this year's candidates, namely Mayus blood, Seven French billiards and finally selected Blind Daylights, are not one of the young generations of Spanish cinematography, "where it should be presented", said Garci.
It doesn't matter what it is.
"You think you're working for the afterlife, and then you realize that only happiness matters, and you're finally happy to have another birthday done," says Garci, with a 30-year-old professional career behind him.
Bayon will remember the life and the life of the Semi-Danced Dancer T√≥rtla's T√≥rtla and her life.
A darkenco-twilighter in Seville also considers the memory of a sleek dancer in Seville to be a memory.
Carmen T√≥tola √† Triana was born in Triana and moved to London with her mother, Georgina √† Valenzula, and was born in Triana at the age of two.
He was an expert in free science and contemporary dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, such as Lordora Duncan, Virginia Wolf or Sarah Spinhardt.
He was a Buddhist and a vegetarian and opposed his opposition to the freedom of women.
A revolution in war in a world of war and aesthetics has been triggered by his life astonished by the Isabel Bay.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gaboa," she suggested to the attention of T√≥rtola, whose personality was truly unhindered."
The faminico manifest has said: "It is our goal to tell the story of his life, but also to capture his mind.
I've been thinking about the titles of flamenco principles.
For example, the "migration whale" for guaji or the "cannabis dancer" for tango.
"It's a remarkable dance and, in other words, it's my custom too," he says.
Two extraordinary contributors stress the image of the performance: Miguel Poveda now sings again after the Open Attitude in Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, which in this case was working with a former student.
"Today, he's the old man, the old man.
I'm happy to hear you say yes to the request, I'm very honoured to perform in my jar."
In addition to the production, Jes√∫s Torres and Paco Arraga music stars and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Puga and Moi de Mor√≥n singers, El Pajaro bat, Rafa El Viola bracs, and Juanfa Ju√°rez, who "plays a solid character with the name of the true diva."
The play also largely shows the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and then comes to places that are still distant, including the United States, the United States or the United States.
"I wanted to remember him because his personality had a great influence on his own age, but these days they no longer know him and even appreciate his work even more."
The lecture started at 8:00 this evening at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of Atennium, the "log of a recent poet" will also be published.
The first edition of a recent poet's diary will be presented in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where, in May 1916, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez concluded a marriage with Zenobia. The presentation is part of the programme entitled Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n Triennium (2006-2008), which the Andal√∫t Regional Government Committee of the Organisation of the Organisation for the award of the Nobel Prize of the Office is the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary and the year of the death of the two.
Thus, the closing times of the Zenobia and Juan Ram√≥n Triennium are the rescheduling of the previous year's expenditure, the restoration of the United States of America, the Nobel Prize-winning Poeting Memorial and the Exhibition "Juan Ramon Som√©nez: It's a bright summer tree". This year, the issue was launched in May, and it was planned to visit New Year's Day in the United States.
Andalus Regional Government's Committee on Prime Affairs has submitted a total of eight hundred copies of the journal published by Perdo Tabernero and played by Jacobo P√©rez-Enciso in his journal of a newly deported poet that he is popular in the reputation and work of one of the most numerous Andalusian poets.
Without Paulma, it is not as attractive America to be so attractive.
"God sometimes has the perfect people in space.
"Which Newman was like that."
The quote comes from an actress named Sally Field, who is the victims of sensationalism, working in a study with Newman, and reflects the shock and powerlessness caused by Newman's death in American cinema and in the whole of America.
As much as he didn't get that shit.
In 2007, it expired,
and was known to be in
but his death is still completely in order.
"Sometimes it's impossible to express our feelings of self, and now I've lost a good animal," said Robert Redford, "have made my life better and this country better."
No one was afraid that it might look like a second or too much.
One of the heroes of the cinema and home has gone through a particularly dark period, which is surrounded by fear of terrorism and market conditions, US self-esteem and desperate search for dignity.
When times like this go by, and many people are easily left with their virtues and very few people we can look up at, you don't have to be Luis Cernuna to praise the Newman.
In people's eyes, it embodys plating beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was the protector of his formal identity and of his thoughts and feelings, and from the memory of his first mother, who died of drug overdose, from the establishment of an anti-drug foundation to the creation of his home food brand.
It was a common gift for a country that was hard to overcome its own suicidal concerns.
The ultimatum of care for the whole of Montenegro, regardless of its nationality and origin, is not only a matter of nationality and origin.
Last time I checked, the Englishman is not one man, he's dead to him.
Another English student Sam Mendes said that Newman's ongoing work with him was the top of his career.
Russellwe, the badass Newman from Australia, called him the greatest inspiration in the world.
"He has made the sign very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who today tries to follow Paul Newman's way of life: they are honest and they are in real and distant privacy.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in connection with today's media mind.
Still, there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his role as a model.
He also got divorced, but then he lived in a faithful marriage for 50 years with Joanne Woodward, but certainly would have been a great opportunity for infidelity.
"Why else would I want burgers if the fried meat was at home?"
In fact, it may be that the girls of the earth are also a fan, which is not very common in Australia.

The maddi Olympics' hot path to the Maddi Olympics.
Indeed, many of us dream of a madrid Olympic, and after the 2012s fail, it may be 2016 itself.
But, question me, are we really ready?
Because if we start out of last night's race, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect resort, but in my view it was the most important of all the many things I've ever been.
A combination of worthlesss was characterized, and if it had to be evaluated once, and I would be the examiner, it would be a clear result.
But let's get on with it and start at the beginning.
The ambiguities began with the transfer of the serial number, which had to be done in the past.
This is not, however, a problem, but if you go before you go, you should at least get it all at once (including the chit, in the future, you should avoid a job).
It didn't happen.
The first number was only handed over (first inconclusiveness, that's why it's sooner to go there) and (second in post), as surprising as it was only a T-shirt with S (second inconclusive, since it's my XL number).
Do we live in a world?
Or did they decide to save money on the matter and buy only the cheapest, small shirts?
But anyway, these things are still getting a little gray in relation to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to the fact that it was terrible early to go over there to take over the chip, it took 15 minutes from the time of arrival, and even the backpack had to be given down.
The waiting lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for more than 11,000 people in a single trainee.
As far as it's concerned, the race has begun, and we haven't given up on our backs yet.
In addition, it made even more pleasant the expectations of more than 40 years, which have been confirmed by attempts to rise and stand up.
Tomorrow we'll have 500 secure pneumonias, and some of them, including themselves, will not be able to do our job with our actual position. I assume my chip is a mistake to start.
If I were to be asked about the perfect tracker, of course I wouldn't have thought of that at all.
I mean, I think we can continue to make a move on from a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) contact is looking for a Microsoft (virtual) contact.
At the MIT Emerging Technologies Conference, Microsoft has shown the development of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent - which, however, can perform some essential tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of a company, a company) on the basis of information from the conversation.
This "reception" is a camera and a form- and facial recognition system that allows you to understand how many people in the room who they are - in fact, it also indicates what they are wearing - and understand and understand the passwords of their conversations.
In addition, on the basis of discussions, you can group the present on the basis of a group of conversations.
At the pre-trial video, the hostess identity is a third person, but she knows she's not a member of the company and she's not an employee of the company.
He will see if he has come to visit someone and will ensure that he is in a hurry to help you.
That's all without the blue big screen.
Amazing.
But of course, this is the life of the future.
At present, the company has a major role to play, such as the development of a new version of the Windows operating system.
During the week, many people were anxious that the Microsoft conversation had changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and includes a complementary programme.
Steve Ballmer found out that if the computers had only the necessary programs instead of a lot of shopping, then the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's all.
They invented the Spanish wax, given that Microsoft has now all recently added extra features and extras to Windows.
The change of direction will come back.
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly behind us, and the software itself is also behind us.
When Google Chrome appears on the net, I also joined the theory that this Google made the first step to become a Windows competitor.
Many people have understood correctly that a language is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, since it is an essential element for the hardware and software dialogue.
It plays the same role as your wife or husband when you say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but you have to calculate the operating system with "death", not absolute, but relatively.
Balmer‚Äôs statement in this paragraph supports this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
We only turn the computer on to open either the Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time to browse than we do in the world of windows.
What is the bulk of the applications associated with the system?
Less or less is more than that.
And Windows 7 is less, much less than Vita.
Less difficult, less depressed, less complex.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services more on-line and, in the future, to provide an alternative to Google.
All of this needs to be done, and I already have an example of why.
This photo was taken at the beginning of the month in Redmond in a chair designed for a Microsoft app.
A poster on the refrigerant machine is called up and is used by the company's language. - "Your choice, our future."
In 2006, an in-depth investigation found that 66% of the KDE Developers used Google to browse the Internet.
Last year, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced.
It's not at the beginning of 2009, it's at the end, it's at the end, it's at the end, it's at the end of 2010.
It is likely that Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 will be placed on the market.
Mobile phones are, after all, more or less functional.
But the slide, given that the Android and the iPhone are already in the market, will definitely ruin their business.
Have you got anything on your side?
It was worn by Pablo Picasso in Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Capro144 Zwick's Bloody Diamond, Al Pacino in the Cross of Francis Ford Coppola, and this is also one of the basics of the gay audience.
And if we're already on the list of specials, we might as well recall the personal figure of the chief of the migration circus's hacky moustache.
But what are we talking about? Nothing but a cotton cloth that is characteristicly narrow and fingerless.
That is, the "tank", as the English people call it, but le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles is not allowed to compete with any of its competitors.
First of all, for some reason - although it's called "Marcel" in the meantime - it's thanks to sport, which is actually named after Marcel Cerdan's boxer, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The Marcel is also seen by its competitors as a result of solid cotton, Unionx, its specific emblem, and the small (low-recognition) Belgian flag, the latter being the most specific ones hiding in the back of their shirts.
However, the Belgian company is not only making tank tops.
Sports clothes, retro turquoises, cashmeres, wool shirts, air-dressers, scrubbers, specials - and so on - are all part of the product's products.
And they all belong to the category of retail loans,
It is also a pity that they must be covered as a bond.
That's too good.

He is very similar to his brother, but he has succeeded in implementing himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.

It was present at the promotion of the new seat of Mango company in Paris and the handover of the most prestigious fashion fees sponsored by the company in the PRC.
It's gonna be a lot of heat and a lot of privacy.
What's really going on in the rest of the world?
We are presenting Mango's new autumn-winter collection, which was planned with my brother, Pen√©lop, and we are also participating in the second competition for 'Mango Fashion Awards' in the opera and the honorable gala at the opera.
It's a busy day, it's true, but it's real.
This is the season of the season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration from the new collection?
Both of us are the movies of the '50s and '60s; we've taken over a lot of things from there.
Many times I just walk into town and listen to the woman, how they move, how they change and choose their clothes - this is my favorite email.
You work as a woman, an actress and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, too, but after all, these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
Even when I was a kid, I was looking forward to going to my grandmother's house and laying in my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you on Canaan, and it was almost worth it with a fun park.
As a dancer, I've always tried to watch my move.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own way around the clock and back to having fun looking in the mirror.
In the role of an actress, you'll be the same as your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and with all due respect to teachers and their expertise.
You recently honoured your first birthday.
Of course not.
I feel better than ever, I love the '30s.
I think women are really worth it, they've been through enough, and they've done less wrong in life.
The hour is not a concern.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I feel like, and it's been a lot of fun for me.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother, because, as a matter of fact, I would like to be a young mother, I certainly don't want to miss that.
The future, as a matter of fact, doesn't matter who it is.
Grow my child in joy and in great and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie. You shot more movies last year, and they haven't even introduced you.
I'm waiting for them to come out. I'm waiting for them to come out.
I, who began in the theatre, am very unrelenting and restless, I want everything immediately, but of course I know that this is impossible.
I look forward to showing you the last hour and search for the grave of the Christ.
I wonder what you think about them...
I understand you've been debuting on the outing with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
Well, no, that's not true...
Anyway, I went up the runway anyway.
I know Naomi Campbell long ago, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which was directed by her own women for a better world, and I chose two of my own Mango collections, and the clothes presented were auctioned, and the amount was offered to Naomi's NGO.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much going on about him, so I'm the one who's here, and I'm sure he's not half the truth either.
On the other hand, I am always looking at the good side of his activity.
He didn't ask me for any questions about the fashion investor, but if he wanted me to stand on his head, I'd do that too.
If a woman in the world has a bet, they don't know what to do.
Backward leaders will be forced to fit in "Alcolock".
After two drinking-driving rules, the Home Office would require a car to install a set that would prevent the operation of the vehicle if the driver was in or does not re-establish the vehicle if the driver was in a drunk state.
The proposal was submitted in June and is now being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which the project will last a year.
The project is intended to return to the market, and the car should also participate in a round course on breeding.
Apart from the Directorate-General for Transport, this experiment includes DGT and FITA.
According to statistics, 30-7 months of car parking is back in the car due to driving in here.
This would help Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of air in the air in the air. If it is greater than the permitted level, or if the driver has not spoken into the device, the system will not allow the car to be tested.
The master of the more than 1000-euro instrument would be responsible for the victim.
A study carried out in the United States of America in 2007 showed that such instruments may reduce the number of infringements by up to 6% during the first year of installation.
On the other hand, it is estimated that this rule could save the lives of 115 people every year.
For two reasons, the measure focuses on infringements: on one hand, it is easier to prevent them from becoming criminal,
Second, to make it easier, since the implementation of legal reform is in the usual medium, while the necessary criminal reform requires a fundamental legislative amendment.
The instrument is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Force, which, as a matter of fact, calls for the installation of the system in shellfish.

In fact, at the time announced in the programme, at 17:00, 40 hours later, the plane of the Asturias F√ºhrer has landed in the presidential hangar of the City of Benito Ju√°rez Airport.
The day was already down, but it was so much fun that we could only use our hands as an observer to get the royal couple out of the plane.
The second ambassador and other senior personalities stood at his feet.
A few hours before that, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Couple would come to town for an official visit.
- Well, then, for a good time today, there will be no airport transfer...
- No, no, sir, the lady, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press, and then everything knows about the Asturias Prince and the importance of their visit.
Many are waiting for the airport sound on a red carpet, the 27 soldiers on a regular basis, who will be served by honours.
It appears in the Prince, smiling, sea blue dress, and then the Princess, in her long hair, she gets hit by the wind, in a back-up toilet, but not in the usual shoes - they may have warned that Mexico City is under a storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras and enter the room, where the official bet is next.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are being reported by one of the mexican mexican mexican mexican mexicans.

The best place in the world to give a fashion prize to Paris is undoubtedly Paris, and among the fashion designers living today is the most sophisticated and most outstanding in the world.
Mango has just launched the second competition for El Bot√≥n-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to present the young artists of the fashion industry in an open manner.
The fee is EUR 30 per cent.
Mango Mango, under 54 of the Paris Boulevard Haussmann, was the winner of the first competition, but he saw his own special features and gave little help to the effect.

In the presence of the most popular Chagalok, the presidential table spoken by Mr. Mango of the Attic has shown even more clearly.
Nati, whose brother recently died with a hard heart and grief, was wearing one of the Company's little pieces and some of the ElAH's salesmen's jewels. With his son, Luis, two feet tall, he was tempted to meet him at his honorable dinner table.
Andik, owner and host of Mango, was entertaining the guests. Bar Rotterdam was always so majestic that they were never even in a suit because they were both awarded it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came into the store in special pants and shirts, and she wore a sexy long dress at dinner. At the night vision, Gayy Toledo's company was so amazed at the ballet room that she fell into one of the rods and gave her a grand plie ride, remembering the old times.
In Sastre did not attend the visit, but before he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning, we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he will be two metres tall and motored - and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Airport in Paris. He also supported his own sheets and towels, and he was well warned that he would not want to have some air in the room.
I'm going to be stars all over the place.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

It's almost time to play the bell at seven o'clock in the morning, but even worse to think about how fast the world gets to life every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer is a backache.
The stress is the population of the 21st century.
But fighting day-to-day extinction and believing in job problems are not one and not two ways.
No, this number is exactly 100 equal.

They speak in their own right
Kids having fun at night.
I don't think about people who get upset and forget what happened to them that day, but about those who talk while they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem to be a little scary at first, but it's really harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure you've told more of them that you've been talking.
In this respect, it can be completely rascal (for example, only once in a high fever) or regular (on a daily, weekly or monthly basis), and usually the child does not remember anything the next day.
Displaying it cannot be reversed for single triggers.
Often other sleep disturbances, such as nightmares, night wakes, night bed rest (enuresis nocturna) or sleep sleep nighttime, but this is not even legal.
As has already been mentioned, a high temperature state, or a state of emergency or elevated alert status, may also be present.
In any case, they did not study until now.
The intensity of the speech is still very different.
It may be quiet, quiet, it may be inaccuracies of words and muttering, but it may, in contrast, also be that it is spoken in speech, crying, or even more protracted words.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to contact the specialist. The investigation will determine whether there is a problem of great anxiety in any other case and may provide a solution.
As we have already mentioned, this is a good phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure for it unless it is accompanied by a different form of sleep disorder that can be handled (e.g. insomnia or a situation).
But some of the things we can do, here's a bouquet of pre-emptive measures:
Let us make sure that the child stays in bed before bed.
Let us choose relaxing games and avoid looking at child-fearing or more aggressive shows or series.
For children who are prone to anxiety or who are more likely to relax, we will teach you some relaxation methods to easily find inner calm.
This will help the child to sleep less quickly.
If he starts talking while he's asleep, let's try to keep our rest safe.
Remember, this is harmless to the child, and the next day they won't be able to remember anything.
Useful advice.
Do not wake the child up.
You're stubborn because the child's unconscious, but he'll be out of his sleep.
Despite the fact that he speaks, he's actually sleeping and he's talking.
Remember, if the phenomenon is accompanied by intense anxiety, it is recommended to contact or explore an expert on what causes the child to become very anxious.
Clearly speaking (this is the last time), do not start to ask questions so that they know anything about it.
It wouldn't be worth it anyway, since while you're asleep, it's not as conscious as to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, they can only hear the speech, but cannot hear the dreams associated with it, which is why they should be careful with the interpretation of the voices and the conclusions that may be drawn.
Don't ever tell the baby that they can ask him about his secrets at night.
Not really.
That's a lot of pressure.
So the most important thing is that they don't worry, it's just a few minutes of harmless times.
Illhaeesern is not even in line with Illhaeesern.
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeesern team finally took a new impetus and won again on its home path.
Although there was no ferocious game, the yellow-blacks were in a position several times, one that they were able to win at the end of the game.
The time of the match was not too tight, as the attackers could hardly feel the right rhythm.
The first door was struck by the host, Kauffmann, but the remote ball was just touching the top corner of the gate. Then the Illhaeusern was caught up and followed by the shots: Funderflick tried by a long shot, and then Hind's hit landed at the gate. Romain splinter, and Diebold was trying to stop Dannemarie by a long-distance attempt.
On the other hand, the players fought in a circle in the middle of the field, and only the pervading Rigahi was in an emergency.
The beginning of the second half of the second half promised a decisive promise: first, Riahi and Temporale took place on Dannemarie. Immediately thereafter, the first goal was created: after the first shooting of Diebold, the llhaeusenn Marais scored and delivered it to the gate (55 minutes).
However, Illhausern's goalie could not have enjoyed the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the court, so his fellows had to do the victory in a human background.
However, Dannemarie was not able to benefit: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who had just a little bit more support to try to protect them.
Meetings with those who are in need
In the United States, while flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy is moving an exit to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration of trades paralysed the traffic of several Bretons and Norwegian ports. Thus, the President of the Republic decided on Tuesday afternoon to visit Le Guilvinec in Finist√®re to meet with the representatives of the Witnesses.
The latter were obliged to receive the President in a "constructive spirit" and to express their hope for the ultimate, who will receive the President with "specific proposals".
The presidential change coincides with the meeting of the "Employment Committee" created by breton fish in order to take action against the rise in the price of gas, since the price has exceeded the last price of EUR 1,14 per litre.
David Martinon, the President-in-Office of the Republic, in his speech, says that "the President will discuss with the interlocutors what solutions could help companies to return to their business and make it safer for citizens to work and hire".
The fishermen are determined to await the arrival of Nicolas Church.
Tuesday morning, Morbihan and Calvados were conducting trade-distorting demonstrations in the region, causing nearly 10 km of congestion.
He also regrets the transport of Cyberon's yacht link, but the roads to Belle-√†le have not been blocked.
In the cyber peninsula, roadblocks were placed on the roadblocks.
On Monday, the officers have already proved their determination, then in the morning, they set fire to the fuel tankers of the Bress ports, while there were protests in Konternau and Saint-Briec.
In Vend√©e County, Sables d'Olonne, such fishermen did not board a ship, while in Le Havre, there were about ninety miles to prevent trade in goods.
In Loire-Atlantique district, La Turballe and Le Croisic were overrun by the great oil refinery in Donges in La Turballe and Le Croisic.
On the other hand, Boulogne-sur-Merka has decided to wait for the Wednesday session to be held at the Ministry by decision on the next steps.
In Le Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "Decision Committee" should decide on the next step and its participation in the meeting scheduled for the Paris Agriculture and Fisheries Commission.
However, a few Bretons do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee's management, as the Committee has not supported its efforts.
"The strike will continue", because "traders will not allow themselves to travel from their currency" and "unable to go to America", for example, L√≠lene Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay any taxes on the oil are now now paying 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the operation of an operation would only make it possible for the price of the oil to fall below EUR 0,30 per litre.

The membraneer does not change its transport plans.
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian company is planning to drop down from 2 to 4 this year.
The fourth largest company in the world, Embraer, can keep the plans and plans to land 215 flights in 2008 - was confirmed by Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 copies.
The manufacturer of the home country company is very important for the Hungarian market, especially for the 30-120 space-place location.
Embraer has been supplying 41 machines to Chinese customers throughout the whole of the year.
More than 1 percent of the assets of AIG sales.
The American International Corporation company, which has been established by the US financial authorities, wants to sell more than 1% of its assets to repay $85 billion in advance - reports the Domic Expenditure of the Financial Times.
Apart from its cross-border and US insurance activities, AIG would differ from much of all other sectors of the business - the story that led to a close link between the funds involved.
According to your information, the AIG's Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities for sale.
AIG does not confirm this information.
The assets intended to be provided include the company's International Lease Financial Corp, the transatlantic holding company's 59% stake in the insurance company, and its real estate and private equity investments, which are included in the Times.
However, it seems that the final decision is not yet related to the assessment.
AIG needs to be able to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the United States to the United States, thereby taking the risk that up to 80% of its members must become its shareholders, and that it will be able to return to its shareholders in proportion to that.
Are Historique's study of the Morning Meeting's historic Morning Meeting meeting.
The New York Stock Exchange reported a significant fall on Monday, after the Senate rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan. The Dow Jones Index fell back by 6.98% (which never meant almost 800 points change), and Nasdasz was 9.14%.
The Dowƒì Industrial Average Index (DJIA) is well down with point 7, and so it closes at point 10 to point 3 above.
The largest fall in the chi so far (684,81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001, when the trade started after the attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq was closed at 1 983,1 points, mainly based on technological outputs, while the standard &amp; Poor's 500 expanded index decreased by 8.8% (i.e. 106 points) to 1 106 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already weakened during the opening, and when the Senate suddenly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market stability, it began to sink.
Members refused to provide the funds requested by the finance minister Henry Paulson in exchange for 205 "no" votes to 228 "yes".
Almost two-thirds of the Republican Republicans have decided on this plan.
"That's why the market has filtered out bad signals, because it seems that the truth is unable to stop a plan" - Lindsey Piegza, FTN's Financial Analyst, is Lindsey Piegza.
"It also seems that, as much as the market did on this plan," he added, and expressed his concern that if they adopted such a plan a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is actually condemned (...), then it will be on the Fed (American central bank - the goods.) and on the other central banks to manage the change and the terms of the loan will continue to increase" - warning Brian Bethune, the leading economics of the Global Insight.
The feeling of urgency is still pressing, Piegza adds: "It has been over and over and over and over again an institution is going bankrupt" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia‚Äôs banking business is being exploited by its rival Citigroup, the Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe has suddenly accelerated, which has called for urgent measures to rescue the governments in the United States, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market has developed "almost US but also global crisis", adds FTN's Financial Analysis.
The bond market has become significantly discouraged.
The yield of the 10-year government bond decreased from 3,827% to 3,632% by Friday evening, and the 30-year-old fell from 4,357% to 4,161% on the following day.
Obam was given the first-time couple's first-time couple's game.
On Friday, the two US presidents followed another debate, which had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would get out of the fight as a winner.
Surprisingly, the representatives of the Republican and the Democratic Republic of the Republic of the Congo have all given themselves the victory in the television double which was followed by a third of the public households.
According to a German political analyst, although John McCain's performance was honorable, it did not prove to be "excellent" enough to stop the low number of his audience: this was demonstrated by a few years before the presidential hearing.
According to Gallup, the Democrat candidate is better off: according to his public opinion polls on Saturday, Obama has three points against McCain (4% and 49%).
39% of the questionnaires in the number of unsolved answers, according to Obama, will win, while 25% of them will count for McCai's victory, according to the CBS estimate.
Oma is expected to further enhance her advantage by her partner, Joseph Biden, on a grand-suspecting Thursday, with Bien's first and most recent rival with Sarah Palin.
Bill Clinton, however, warned me this weekend: "It would be hard to underestimate Palin.
He's got it.
McCain, in his late 70s, is never going to be happy to give priority to his own, indisputable, huge foreign policy experience. However, he calls on his opponent to "witness" on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"Looks like Senator Obama doesn't understand how," he said more.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidency," said McCain.
This is the main attack point used by Republican television advertisements from recent years as well.
In turn, he pointed out that he was the one who would represent the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he was united and precise.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore a picture of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama is now," said the democrat ad broadcast this weekend, pointing to the Republican leader's eye that he still hasn't discovered the effect of the crisis on the people of the United States of America's street.
"In the course of this debate, John McCain had some news about me, but nothing about it," he said yesterday in front of Obama's 20,000 people who were gathered in a spring in North Carolina to meet at the meeting.
He has not even spoken the words "public" or "workers" in his mouth. In today's world, a troubled situation is undoubtedly in the mood of Obama, which the Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy behind the collapse.
"The next week might be a day's work," he said yesterday, Charles Schumer, the influential Democrat senator.
One of the veterans of the Clinton government, Rahm Emanuel, is a representative of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Clinton Government) and is a member of the "Economic Committee" of Obama.
In the Democrat Presidency's view, the current crisis is the 'final judgment on the two-years bad economic policy that George Bush has put in place with the support of Senator McCain's support.
The Ilinois Senator reaffirmed that, despite the fluctuations in the stock market, it will be able to reduce the tax burden on 9 percent of the Americans. He added that its main objectives are to create the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy resources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
However, McCain plans to build 45 power plants by 2030.
However, both presidents have taken note of the questions concerning the rescue plan of the $7 billion (EUR 4 billion): the extremely unpopular plan has been adopted by the Congress this evening.
Minsk: "Did you notice that you've been here?"
Young people and opposition were protesting this evening at the capital square of the capital of Belarus in order to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
Sunday evening, after the close of the polls, several hundred Russians gathered on Minsk Main Square to protest against the falsification of election results.
Whatever results have not been achieved, many of the young protesters, Mr Lukashenko, against President, have said, "Mr. Dictator, resign!".
Some people admit that they didn't even go to vote, "Why would I? They're doing what they want with my vote!", says a young man.
Those who do not believe that the regime, which, in the face of foreign ministers, has made a good effort to communicate with the European Union, would be ready for a complete change of system.
If the choices were to be taken as a matter of fact, they would be able to release the country's sanctions, in which they ordered the visa from 40 Russian leaders, and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, it seems to me that the elections were not pure.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees, and some of us were unable to participate in the vote accounts" - unfortunately, Yuri Potyemkin, who was formed from the twelve parties, so he is a very heterogeneous spokesperson of the coalition of United Democratic Forces.
"The changes were only nominal" - stressed Aleksandr Miinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The important thing is to vote out the votes, and in our case this executive power.
If the representations of the opposition enter Parliament, that means that they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament will allow them to be located in the country, to sit in the country's regions and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition should therefore take action in political life because "it is necessary to initiate dialogue with the European Union".
In fact, if our economy, which is seriously indebtedness towards Russia, is re-negotiated and cannot be renewed, we would assume that we are under the jurisdiction of Russia.
What, on the other hand, can be independent."
The opposition believes that the European Social and Social Assembly following the election process will adopt the vote's vote in force.
They stress that the participation rate seems to be too high and that the broad organisation of the preliminary vote (as represented by 26% of the citizens in Minus) has given any interpretation.
"You have noticed that you have made a choice here?", asks the question, "He is the leader of the Aleksandr Kozulin Social Democrats, who was the first to be released from prison this August from prison, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one stayed in the asylums.
In this Parliament, there will be five members of the European Parliament, and they will be those who are appropriate to the leadership.
By October, the silence of the night will fall again.
In the meantime, Chairman Lukasenko and the members of the Central Election Committee will be elected.
It's a new one. It's a new one. It's a new one.
The 10th anniversary of Hema-Quebec's opening yesterday was a good reason for this celebration, because the Hema-Quebec has become one of the most secure and effective domains in the world.
The most important thing is that it has been able to regain people's trust, which has been seriously shaken by the scandal of the infected blood of the 1980s and 1990s.
It is known that the national reserves managed by the Canadian High Cross blood service were infected with the derived immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general breakdown, the Government of the United States of America in February 1994 launched an official investigation under the leadership of Horace Krever, which was intended to highlight the circumstances that have led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid similar cases.
While Judge Krever had a minor report, some Member States have set up their own committees aimed at designing a new blood management system for Canada.
In advance, the G√©linaus Committee carried out this task.
As a result of the G√©linene and Krever reports, two monitoring services have been established in Canada: one is Hema-Quebec, serving Qu√©bec, and the other is the Canadian Blood and Blood Society, which is responsible for all the rest of the state and for the two territorial care.
"When Hema-Qu√©bec began its activities in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Qu√©bec's maintenance system", remembers Dr D√©cary.
The fact of the matter was uncontroversial.
"In the coming years, however, we have managed to regain people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the area." D√©cary says with pride that almost 94% of the qu√©bes population in 2008 considered the Hema-Quebec to be reliable in the early years.
However, Dr. D√©cary does not forget that "trust is a very fragile matter".
Since the foundation of Hema-Quebec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the principle of prudence.
A number of cases have been discovered during this period when people have been infected with the disease of the LSD, i.e. the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, - the doctor tells us, who has been running the company since its founding in 1998.
"We didn't even know if this medication was going through blood.
Therefore, we are relying on one of the most important points in the Krever and G√©lineau reports, which means that if we are certain of this, and there is a risk of serious illness, we must apply preventive measures. In this case, it was the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which causes the brain to change and therefore inevitably lead to death.
Therefore, we did not accept blood from anyone who has been in the United States for more than a month since 1999.
A few years ago, however, it was undoubtedly established that the food is also transmitted through blood.
This case has convinced us that it was reasonable to apply the principle of prudence."
In 1999, there was a technique on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which is capable of detecting the virus directly in the blood of the donors, not the antibodies made against the virus, on which they were built.
The NAT test will help us to shorten the environment that lasts from infection as long as we can detect the virus in the blood through our technical means - explains the expert.
This period could be reduced for at least one shorter period.
There has been a significant reduction in the risk of blood transfusions infecting the blood without knowledge, and that this cannot be demonstrated.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of drug transfusions.
Today, the risk that someone with HIV virus is infected with blood is $12.
"In other words, this means that we should allocate 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since the Huma-Quebec employs 400 to 500 000 blood products every year, it should take more than 24 years to infect one of these cases and one of them with HIV virus through a blood medicine.
I think that anyone can now accept or give up blood transfusions to restore health - says the first leader of Hema-Quevac.
"The challenge of the coming future will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We don't even know what new pathogens are entering the system.
The only thing that happened last year was that there was a owl virus on the island of Reunion that entered the blood like the owl virus.
Therefore, we must always be alert", Dr. D√©cary continued, and he stressed that besides the emergency reserves, the Huma-Quebec must provide sufficient permanent reserve.
"In the old age of the population, there are also needs.
As anticancer medications have become more aggressive, patients often need to add fat or blood platelets.
The ageing of the population has an impact on the population of sacrifices, since the number of persons on the network who have been sacrificed represents only 3% of the population.
However, every healthy person at least 18 years of age who fulfils the conditions of competence gives blood every 56 days.
Some people do not accept blood from 14% on average, because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in countries where malaria is, for one year, are not entitled to give up.
"This gives us 3 percent of the amount of food we have to be able to satisfy the needs of hospitals.
It is very rare that we are running out of energy.
On the other hand, the number of sacrifices needs to be increased to the extent that existing ones do because they can no longer give blood after a period of time.
However, it is very difficult for people to convince them to give blood, but it is even more difficult to give them and make them become regular sacrifices.
In today's rushing world, man's only hour is barely enough to go out and give blood" - he's sorry, Francine D√©cary.
Hema-Quebec provides not only blood products but also human animals, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and leather, which are used in almost all seriously burned individuals, from a budget of $2 million a year.
These tissues will be analysed, converted and frozen and placed at the Hema-Quebec, which also manages one of Quebec's only public house.
Hair is a blood that is rich in stem cells, allowing it to treat serious diseases (such as leukemia).
"As long as we've been celebrating that we've had our team in the first thousand pounds of cord blood samples, and every year we plan to take more than one new sample.
At the beginning of next year, we are likely to start these procedures for a transplant" - Dr. D√©cary, as stated, says that the cord blood transfusion program is very popular these days.
"There is a lot of confusion because this is not possible" - that is true, since Hema-Quebec is not in a position to make this complex and expensive program available to Qu√©bec all the time.
Soccer - first semi-final with Impact
The team of the Myanmar Impact defeated Seattle Sounders yesterday at 3:1 on the USL-1 seismics of Seattle Sounders, and the total score of 4:3 has reached the semi-finals. This was the fourth-final match for the second and final results, which was taken place at the Saputo Stadium.
The final score was earned by Antonio Ribeiro in his mid-lifes at 90th.
While the first half was gone without a goal, the second was found in the enemy's bedroom by two middle-levels of the multilateral team, David Testo and Rocco Plantino.
Of the Sounders team alone, Roger Lemesque managed to play the Matt Jordan gate.
Remember, in his first reverse on Friday, Impact 2:1 suffered a defeat from the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, outside Seattle.
That's the lead player in the Vancouver #caps.
Saturday evening In Minnesota, Thunder's team, which received 3:1 from the Whitecap at the first match, won 4:3, yet Whitecaps got into the semi-finals with all the results of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet you on Friday and Sunday at ~caps, but the details of the texts will still be updated today.
In the walrus - winner Kovav is the winner of the goal.
The Canadiens' favorite mourn is waiting for another season.
The Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsy produced great attacks, and finally the Canadiens won a 2:2 hit against the Florida Panthers last night on the ground.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec two, and Kovalev closed the match with a lead, which was the fourth victory since the end of the team's tenth anniversary.
Att Kovalev decided to take a single goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet" - warns the player.
"There's another thing I need to do to make me feel really real."
"Too much tried to get you out of it in the first third," he noted Guy Carbonn.
"But I think the final outcome of the game was enough.
He's got a huge suite."
North of grost's ambitions for the north.
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election is still taking place this year.
This was not the case for the Liberal Party meeting, Jean Charest, who was travelling to Jean-Talon in Qu√©beci today, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left) broke the victory in the interim elections to be held today.
"Our last long-term northern border": this is what the ambitious long-term goal has been set by Jean Yaest at his meeting yesterday in London in the Democratic Party of Qu√©be, London. This speech was also accompanied by visual elements, but the president tried to focus on the subject.
During his presentation, they were inspired by the same sequences as "Moulin √† mus" in his back.
The three great projectors have been followed by amazing images: dams of hydropowers, mining, Qu√©bec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such instruments are used during the selection periods.
The Prime Minister, in the press, refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his time schedule was very close.
"The plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's vision for the future of Quebec, which is reflected in a "new economy". This includes a labour convention with a country, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of future agreements on Ontaro.
In recent times, the opening to the North (north of the 49th latitude) was often in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has not yet spoken on this subject.
The state, however, merely insisted that he explained why he considered North to be "a huge treasure full of opportunities." He did not mention the time factor, investment amounts, or in particular the order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development options have been highlighted: in particular, hydropower, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of the emerging countries and the reconstruction of public authorities.
It is located in the north of "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds", he said.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", is our territory, the area of Quebec.
Not only are we, but we are inside," the Prime Minister reiterated, stressing that this would create a national foundation myth.
He pointed out that Qu√©bec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the Gold West Abit Others, our qu√©be teacher, the James Bay...
"This is the truth, our future!" he said, after holding a staged break, he took a look at the map behind his back.
70 % of the territory of Qu√©bec also includes part of Labrador, which Qu√©bec has always followed itself, the Prime Minister announced in the press release.
"This is our fundamental statement, which all the states have.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if it happens, I will reaffirm the same word on behalf of the government", he said.
On the other hand, "In the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our approach to the world," said the Prime Minister on the Northern Passage, which is open all the time as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the Prime Minister's view, in this new geopolitical environment, taking this area is an important task.
What about his natives, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec was paying particular attention and that the plan would bring a great deal of benefits, especially for young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel L√©tournee (later from the Ungai of Parti Qu√©b√©cois) have already agreed with some 30 local communities.
It has also been led by the Vice-President of the Commission of the European Union, which has played an important role in the role of Ms Julie Loulet (Secretary for Transport and Natural Data Protection).
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, a "unnecessary summit", where "they create a common vision".
The principle of sustainable development will be implemented in line with the principle of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly" - promised the Prime Minister.
Jean Charles described this "television" as being in line with the liberal root of his prehistoric nature.
"Just like the previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the new themes of the weekend that started with the big Christmas party on Friday at the 50th anniversary of the election of President Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions taken suggests that the Beuharnois force be transferred to the Adeleard-Godhi barrier.
"Our politicians, including Godhudro-Quequet, who founded the silent revolution and the nationwide proliferation of hydropowers, or the Bourassa, known as the father of the Gulf of James, all knew how to help the future," Jean Chares said.
In the press, he also quoted another true, conservative work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1970 and 1963 "Roads to the North".
As regards the plan for the Eastmain1a hydrogen tank dam, President Charest pointed out that the installation will be planned for 2012.
"This is between us, but I intend to be there," he told his believers, and his statement was received by a loud applause storm.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that he would not have a choice in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which the law also allows for.
However, the emphasis is on the fact that the calendar is already complete, since it has been assigned to the Federal Council meeting and to the Qu√©bec-New York Summit.
At the end of the week, a party meeting held for the Liberal President has proved to be an excellent platform for the development of nationalist decisions, which have been called for without any thought. It is mainly the "promotes on the Constitution": the Liberal Party, in particular, calls for the recognition of "the specific nature of the matter" in the Constitution.
I would also like Qu√©bec to be able to appoint a member of the Canadian Communication and Communications Council, and these members would have the right of defence in Qu√©bec decisions.
The opposition, on the other hand, sceptically accepted the main points of the North Plan.
The leader of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, Paulina Marois, once again raised the northern qu√©bec policy, which the Landry Government will establish in 2001.
In that sense, the liberal government, which entered into power in 2003, rejected the application of this policy.
If they had not done so, "we would have said so much now", she said in agreement with Mrs. Marois Fran√ßoise Mercure, who was the candidate for today's vote in Jean-Talon.
ADQ's opposition supports the adoption of the United States Plan by the government.
"But what we're saying is that if it wasn't a mere play," said Judge S√©bastien Proulx, who replaced today's returning Mario Dumont.
Letters - A loving country
Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabin (or Minister of Justice) last summer, took the initiative to call Louise Arbour Canada "the shame".
Blaming a woman who has been without control for the truth and deserves all our thanks - this is a great deal of thanks for the people who are surrounding the truth and for Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, which, in some cases, has not delivered its own citizens from the rest of Guantamo concentration.
This is the government that does not really believe in the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager when he committed crimes against him.
This is the only government that has made Canada sign the Geneva Convention, denying its word and allowing a child soldier to inhumanely abuse a child soldier.
The only country that's making a puppet theater about justice is the one that's investigating a suspect's guilt.
Just remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian attorneys are also asking for Omar Khadr to be returned home so that he can have a reasonable procedure in China.
And our government is blind to the tour: it's important that one's soul is already completely ruined, and it's probably marked its fate for years.
Although we are not aware of this now, but it is now the very destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy": Harper speaks this word, which in her mouth is a mere word of speech.
The time has come, therefore, when there is no more reality: it is arbitraryly possible to beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen according to the plight of a leader of a government that has so far been in the minority (and what can be done after 14 years...?).
A lot of good people believe that salvation can be found by a party that honors the Force, the Law and the Order.
Mr. Toews, this is what he's looking for, not anywhere else.
- Report on the nomenclature of the word 'Barrick Gold' orwegian orwegian.
By the number of Le Devoir of 17 September, he received a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director-General of the Barrick Gold Mine of Canada.
As a result of Orwelli's reasoning, Garver states that the world's largest producer company has brought forward six $6 adjudication lawsuits against three authors and a small company for the purpose of a so-called "public debate" initiative.
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decisions - especially in the face of hypocrisy - are not the truth, they are the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver listened deeply to this fundamental issue.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to its own interests?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, authors and publishers of Noir Canada must spend considerable amounts of money on protection and fighting in an unfair battle where on the other side there is an army of lawyers supported by the equally inexhaustible sources of mining.
In the face of such inequality, however, they often use the tactics of extermination of the defendant and of making a friendly standing, which not only silences the opponents, but also threatens those who try to deal with the idea again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public.
Although in many other countries, where Barrick Gold is active, otherwise, in some countries the disputing parties usually do not bump into each other, but tell them the time.
Therefore, the mine would have had enough to open its books and dossiers and prepare for a real debate in today's, media, recently made, allowing for major research groups that could have reached out to the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public, and with one move, it sidetracks the requests and letters written for the protection of the authors of Noir Canada.
Mr. Garver could possibly explain how he intends to engage in a "public" debate, if, however, he does nothing to the opinion of this public.
On the other hand, this word is, in fact, a mere lawyer who is paid by bus, rather than a locality of Canada: the meaning of the concept is so narrowed down.
In the same state, the freedom of expression is also relevant to those who appreciate others.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mainly supported by the public because it condemns the way the mine is done.
The public will be willing to listen to Barrick and to judgment, but this is on the basis of civil arguments rather than on the part of a lot of people. (In other words, Barrick Gold has spoken out to the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
Throughout Garver's surreal ideas, the Barrick Gold process is an attack on the freedom of universities and the search for truth, which is the essence of all society.
In doing so, the procedure denies the right to quote the authentic resources, something to debate the facts and interpretations which form the basis of spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, it is only possible to study and discuss issues that do not please the rich companies of the world today, who will do this?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by Noir Canada authors.
You have the right to reply.
In our universe, we have long been able to deal with disputes, conflicts and conflicts for a number of years now.
Barrick Gold's indiscreet procedure seems to be good at arguing that, contrary to what he claims, he has no interest in having a debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the Canadian public debate institution. It has been a long time since governments have implemented measures that will affect legal procedures for this abuse.
Wall Street rescue action - The Democrats and Republicans agreed on an agreement.
The leaders of the Government of the People's Republic and of the Republic of Republic of Republics and Democrats agreed yesterday on the economic rescue measure, which is the main plan for the Great Economic Crisis in the 1930s.
The one-tenth of the US dollar plan, aimed at curbing the financial crisis that has been going on on Wall Street for months, still needs to be approved by the two houses of the country.
The main points of the plan are: better monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the planned public funds; new measures to keep the number of houses occupied due to non-payments; access to the remuneration of managers of assisted companies.
Henry Paulson, US finance minister, Nancy Pelosi, President of the United States of America and Judd Gregg, representative of the Republican Republican who participated in the negotiations yesterday, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon negotiations were concluded.
"We have made great progress towards a way that will function effectively on the markets", said Henry Paulson, the State of the British Government.
"We have done our utmost to save the real economy and the American citizens from now on," explained the Democratic Republic of.
"The key thing is that if we do not do this, then shock, chaos and confusion will be huge in the lives of the Americans," said Republican representative Judd Gregg.
The trial was speeded up in the last few hours by fear that another damage would have an impact on the lives of investors.
The agreement was concluded by the Stock Exchange until the opening of the breakfast.
The two presidents who joined the negotiations late in the negotiations were willing to make the agreement, however it is clear that they are not happy that the situation has improved to its full extent.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama devotes himself to the extension of the Agreement with elements such as the preservation of the owner of the house or the payment of the directors of state-aided companies.
"When you ask the taxpayer to take certain urgent steps because of the irresponsibility of other people, that is not too bad.
These steps are necessary," he said in an American show.
And when your opponent, John McCain, asked another channel if he would vote for the plan, he said, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I've seen in the big lines is now that it's something we all have to digest, and it's what we can do.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the plan of figure 700, taxpayers' money would sell the dual assets of US financial institutions, which he put at risk, his invaluable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month period of recession, which was triggered by the real estate explosion. First, the collapse of risky real estate (second mortgage) loans will result in a collapse and then transferred to other debt-corporating (trade) trades, and ultimately the freeze of assets and the accumulation of banks and financial assets.
The first draft agreement was published by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems that we have been able to get out of this dead end since the Democrats have called for certain "toxic" devices of the companies in question to be provided by the government rather than by the government.
In order to ensure that all members are satisfied, a provision is included in the plan, which states that if the government has to bear losses for a period of five years within the programme, it may then impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, the first item of USD 250 billion would be paid; this could be followed by another 100 billion, if the President considers it necessary.
The remaining ten billion dollars will have to be paid to the United States by another vote.
In exchange for the benefit of guarantor guarantor, guarantor, acquires a share in the supported company, through which he receives dividends from the currency and which he may sell after the transaction of the press.
The central government will be able to delay the reservation of properties covered by the mortgage loans covered by the plan.
I would like to make a plan if the plan were to be voted by the Internet today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Of course, though, their tensions are still not sure that the plan is being decided upon.
For the second time, statements against the plan have been repeated between both the Republicans and the Democrats.
"It is quite clear that Washington does not hear your voice," he declared to the voters the Republican Scott Gartt, who is a member of the household committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no such thing as a favour for taxpayers."
Mr Sherman, the representative of the Democrats leading the small congressional group called the "sceptic faction", has changed the way things are going, but it is the same outcome.
"Four great economic experts, including three Nobel Prize winners, have told us to ask the United States: do not hurry and look carefully at the way it chooses," said SILMAN yesterday.
In fact, at the same time, it is clear that this is a global crisis.
Following this agreement, the two Benelux States state that a part of the Fortis Group is owned by a total of EUR 11.2 billion (U.S. $16,3 billion).
The help of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom has become necessary after the announcement of the French BNP Parabas does not reveal its competitor in bankruptcy, after the 2 million Euros (2.9 billion US dollars) was lost due to the U.S. mortgage credit crisis in the United States.
Fortis's 85 000 employees are one of the twenty largest Europeans and the ten largest Republics.
"This is not the money that was thrown out" - said Minister of Finance of Wlayer Bos yesterday.
"In exchange for the right to vote and the right to vote in it.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is sounding uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Mane, the British Government seems to have launched another bank, which has been driven away by the financial crisis.
According to the English authorities, the government would take over the total amount of current loans to the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which the real estate transfer is worth 41 billion pounds (75,5 billion US dollars).
The Spanish bank yesterday announced that they were going to take out the subsidiaries and customers of the British bank.
Bradad and Bringley, after this Northern Rock, would be the second bank that the United States has wanted state aid since the beginning of today.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Good-bye to the server.
The eyes of all these blues were, according to some, a bat, and, according to others, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were, they were
Is it ever survived a narcissistic mirror of the smile- smiled American model?
No, I don't.
By virtue of its weakness, sensitivity and associated talent, the creed style, which is the spirit of the true great manners of the art world, has been far removed from it.
But he did run a huge career.
Paulman died at the age of six on his mother's farm in Connecticut. He was one of the last icons of his American cinema.
There was less monumental individuality than Brando, who was like him, and who for a long time has been a rival on the global stage. In his roles he was more retaliated and, most certainly, more vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood is often an inevitable animal.
Newman was born in 192 in Ohio, a mother of German Jewish and Hungarian origin.
European roots have contributed to the creation of one of the symbolic forms of the American dream.
He didn't think too much about himself, what he just made his point.
In fact, it is a country whose imagination of "self-made man" and the broken fighting spirit of the Pacific War, a country that died in the early 1950s on the drama of Yale University and studied in Actor's Studio, New York, before the theatre, television, and soon thereafter on the world of cinema.
In addition to the fact that he was a civil rights fighter, he reached second place as a car driver on my 24-hour Le Mans race in 1979. However, he was considered to be a sexist, although he has been married since 1958 to Joanne Woodward.
Now we can never know what the shadows of the life of this mysterious, closed, work-in-the-work-in-the-work-in-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-the-art-the-art-the-art-the-the-art-the-the-art-the-the-art-the-the-the-the-art-the-the-the-the-the-art-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-art-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-art-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-art-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-
He was honest, the word is at least honest.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the motion picturers: in most cases, it is only the mother of memories that we can see.
Looking at his next move, we have been facing the seventh American world, and the movie has been about to change for over 50 years.
Back in our memory, the charming cowboy of the "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and the cold young man from the sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), in which we saw the "cat on the bed-tip" in the Tennessee Williams processing in 1978.
In recent times (1990) we know from the sensitive Mr. Bridge who faces an old age when his life has failed his hopes.
In addition to Newman, we could see a lot of other faces in his face.
Robert Believe "Others up there" in his film, the stormy-lived evil boxer Rocky Graziano, who was originally going to play a role in Newman's creative career after his death in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic crime in the brilliant creation "The Big Trouble", which won the best in 19 years for the best.
Roberten, in his brilliant film "The Swindler" (191), turned into a bitter, vindictive billiard player, and then returned to Martin Scorsese in his "The Money of Money".
Changes in times, but always the same thing: this was him.
It's always been that way.
The period of his career has been characterised by changes in periods of time.
Young people are mainly familiar with George Roy Hill's cult film, called "Refrigerant" (19th, 19th), where Reggie Dunlop is a teacher of an ever-time march with unorthodox methods.
But he was seen in 1994 by the Coen brothers in the "The Big Jump".
The line was closed in 2003 by Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Damage": this appeared in the role of an Irish mafia master.
Contrary to a number of motion trends that soon gave up the film platform, Newman has been in a long-term reflective mode, although he has condemned Hollywood with its glamour, lightness, and image.
Bertant Tavernier's double-driving player did not think, without all the humor, that he was like "the living debacle of the game": he thought his game was too powerful.
The profession, however, has not always been cruel to the handsome Paul St. Peter, who for a long time has just been put in the back of his butt by twins.
Yet, he often plays young and successful characters: rather, he was a nervous person living on the very edge of society, a nervous person, an alcoholic person, an abusive person, or a fatherless person, who was able to return his drift and his performance with perfect truth.
In general, Newman has shown an unusually unknown face: his heart is really visceral and human.
In 1968, in a film entitled Rachel Rachel (adaptation of the novel of the Canadian judge Margaret Laurence), Joanne Woodward and his wife, Joanne Woodward, drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman in the main play.
In the 19th century, "Harry and his son" calls his son Scott, who died of drug overdose with a film of restraint and excitement.
Newman's many reverends remembered the subject. His close friends and old fellows, Robert Redford (with whom they were fighting together in "The Big Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and Sundance", he said: "His presence made life and the world better.
The pleasure of generosity and being: it was the secret of this wonderful individual of the beautiful actor, who is now away from us.
In addition to his career as a legend, his comments on civil rights, on the environment, on the free search and on Hollywood's flaws are dim.
Many times we could see the image of you smiling on the packaging of sauces, sorceres, biscuits and other foods.
However, such income has always been assigned to a fund for children suffering from sickness.
He's been on the doubles: he's been committed to the business all along.
He wrote the following sentences to his two daughters: "Your father has always and for all his years been incredibly grateful for his precious star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to be able to accompany such a brilliant and generous American artist's career.
As a citizen, above all, he was a citizen.
What are they doing in Zusclag & Tsai's factory?
Today, on 8 October, the trial against Mr. Zushlag and others is about to begin.
Politicians and societies are accused of fraud and other crimes, including document fraud, which cause particularly serious harm in criminal law and which have been committed in criminal matters on a perpetrated basis and have been done without delay.
According to the D.A., the successful tender money has been used for each of their own purposes, and the task is often carried out with untrue invoices.
Public and general government funds - total of about 65 million HUF - are part of the Office of the Young Left, partly in the back of some individuals.
The method also known by the Authority was that the successful tender money was collected on the basis of invoices that were not a real achievement and that the associations never made a commitment.
According to the document, much of the figures were false.
These were purchased in a good city market for billboards, and the surrounding stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalason.
and which companies were named after the company's production, including on the Balaton-surrounded tour to which Mr. Zushlag sent Mr. Lados Ist√≠v.
According to his report, he had to look like food and restaurant.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption, which, as a matter of fact, was then prepared by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour Archives and the City of Helsinki to be submitted for proposals.
In most cases, Istv√°n Lados, with his partner, Andr√©s Tarri, who, according to our information, has now written the necessary accounts for the award of the aid.
One of Lados' "student's" assets was a disaster.
Auschlaki issued by the Zuschlakis, two in 2003 according to which the host provided a meal for the Commonwealth Association's singles group.
but, according to the association, they would not have been allowed into the guest room at the same time.
Also for the better future - later together, it was a result of errors in the form and content of the 3rd Millennium Foundation issued during the summer of 2002.
For a badadacsomas crisis was only three rooms, with more than three people unable to sleep one night, but the figure was still about a hundred and thirty guests.
However, fanciful forms filled out even when they contain the one-off service Pigal Ltd., which, according to the information provided to the court, did not contain the documents for the better future and the name of Hoppa.
The head of the company, Gy≈ër Farkas, told the gramg.hu that when he was called in and invoiced to the D.A., he knew it was false documents.
"Our name and tax number were wrong on the guard."
He added: for formal reasons, the fact that everyone says they're staying, because they have 11 rooms, with no room available.
It was also a matter of keeping a record of food, but their food is not working long ago.
Exciting firecrackers have not gone through the fact that the Budapest Travel Convention they look like only organises trips abroad, so that Hungarian consumers have been shown to be a service on the cash account, which is also not in line with the company's idea of issuing money.
- as in the investigation - the document included VAT, although it was exempt from VAT for public service activities in countries outside the European Union.
Among other things, the VAT rate has been wrong for Hotel Rep√©vf√ºl√∂p Road. by providing four documents for the Right Future, since the company's services are not VATed at 25 per cent, but 15 per cent, and the hotel employees only issued machine invoices, but the invoice produced was in hand.
In addition, the "distributors" of the fact that for a company, road freight has been identified as a different activity - which has been revealed through the prosecution's procedure - which has not been the subject of actual investment advice.
Also formal derogations - inadequate numbers, not real guardians - have resulted in the fact that the accounts for the Third Millennium Foundation, the XXI century Cultural Association and the True Point are false.
As in Ravenna Bt. or the Kunsut√≥ Sports Camp, which has been denied by representatives that the invoices would have been issued by them.
They are also not aware of the fact that HIB Kft. in New York was liquidated at the time (2001) when it was eaten by the Group of the Young United States, but the company's liquidator - as we know - refused to stop the paper.
They were conscious of who they were.
Another category of issuers is those who were aware of the need to issue a financial account.
At the request of the young Left - Young Socialists, the Foundation for the Third Millennium Foundation has issued an invoice for the Joint Fortress Fund for around four decades.
The head of Collab Kft. - according to the document - was led by one of the defendants, Gy√∂rfi Ludovic, to issue the fictional account.
He also cooperated with Zuschlae with the current liquidation of Biogate Ltd., which in 2003 generated the Best Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Association of the Red Sea, with invoices issued in gross terms forints, which were not behind a real economic activity.
Neither is it moving because the prepared accounts have been torn off the market, but these organisations have already been included in our documents.
The next group of billing companies are those who are connected to the defendants.
Thus, he was responsible for the service of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Tri√≥ Kft., which is based in Budapest, for trade in fuel and motor vehicles, although not located in Budapest, and was responsible for the delivery of Kubatov Iv√°n.
The company will issue several invoices in the course of the year 2005, in the course of the year and in the course of its sale, at about HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd., a small municipality that had been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
This company was the manager of a Romanian man who would have been able to pass on his corporate documents between 2002 and 2005.
I mean, Cubatov in the course of the investigation has admitted that Kft. has been issued to Atlas, Hoppa and the Co-operative to the Third Millennium Foundation, and has received their consideration.
In particular, at the request of Cuba, Romania has been founded by the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. at the request of Iv√°n Kubatov.
In fact, however, none of them did what the defendant said was because they didn't get a job.
However, companies have benefited from this because, at the request of their accused partner, the United States of America, which also prepared the papers of the company, the companies have issued invoices in the name of the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
Cash Sales, the Delta Trio, the Fa-Bani Jos, the Jos Sales and the Linaxtrade total of 11 invoices for Cuba, worth HUF 14,2 million.
The D.A. considered that 10 percent of the amounts entered in the invoices and the VAT was paid to Cuba.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. for the production of fictitious accounts, which were made available to the Commissioner's Point tender.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Association submitted an invitation to tender for the Public Organisation of the Socialist Party, the Mih√°ly Foundation of the University of Tartu (TMA) for Modern Hungary.
There were between 500 and 1,000 HUF, but the amounts were not used for the purpose of the tender.
To keep this from happening, the TMA has provided the TMA with five personal accounts received from Works Team Kft.
These invoices were found by the way to √Årp√°d Kemechesi in the home house house house in the educational wallet.
Some of the defendants in the trial, as they did in the prosecution's office, are likely to report on the prosecution's proceedings.
Most importantly, if you are the prime suspect, J√°nos Zuscheg himself decides that you are above everything else.
In fact, his statement is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly expected that he would talk about everything, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether this is the right thing to do, perhaps the majority of the damage, was negotiated by the Socialists for 50 million forints in return, and Zusi would take the fall.
For the first time, anyone who has ever been offended has been found constantly deaf ears in order to reduce the circumstances of his detention, which means that his requests for him to put him in prison have been found in deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of far greater harm and non-returning economic crimes are free to walk, or at least to wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, this is not possible.
The technology of oversimplification: why are we giving out more money?
In the transactions, customers tend to issue more money, to overvalue the goods.
all known - and seemingly unique - changes in neurologic-economial foundations have been discovered by the researchers of Budapest, Budapest, New York, and by the researchers of New York.
According to their study published in the journal Science, people do not want to stay in a single contest such as eBay, which is too high a price.
He tried to map the nervous system pattern of this "play" research using experimental images.
One group of volunteers was lotteryd, the other group participated in a team of players, while the method of functional magnetic resonantation (FMRI) has been used to examine the entire brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could earn money, but during the discussion - which is an essential element of the over-allocation of the other party - the trim of the striatum, the submersible complex took place intensively when the game was lost.
This brain has a number of other roles in the context of the "phrasing" of the nervous system.
For this reason, researchers believe that the price rise may result from the absence of a sharp reaction from the striatum.
For the purpose of their theory, the members of the research community's economist have also carried out financial investigations.
Three groups have bided against a partner under circumstances.
The group simply stated the real value of the product and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was given the value that if they make a profit out of the game, they will now receive another $15 in cash.
The third one, on the other hand, received $15 before the last one, but in the event of a loss, the members of the group made this money.
As a result, the difference between the two groups was that one of them was rewarded with a gift and the other with a loss.
However, the members of the team of neurologists, which played against loss, were willing to make a higher bet than the control and strength groups.
"these results cannot be derived from an economic theory that is not in existence.
For this reason, only the joy of victory and the risk of risk have been used to explain the phenomena on the market.
Only the neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now reaching a third revision", says Andrew Schotter, Professor of Economics in New York, University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we contact a doctor?
There are about half a billion people in the world who suffer from hepatitis B or C, and Hungary are among the leading causes of death, including chronic liver disease.
One thousand thousand can be used to treat the number of hepatitis at home, but only seven thousand are treated, which is why: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The hepatitis designation is a compound name of inedible warts caused by various viruses.
In these symptoms, there is a lot of similarity, which is typical of inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but there are different types of pathogens and diseases.
Apatitis viruses each cover two main types of pathogens: hepatitis A and E via nutrients (such as infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D, and other substances with blood and body fluids (stomach, fuel, mouth).
Passengers are certainly protected against A and B viruses, and there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A occur two or three times in two to three days after consumption of infected food, generally feeling unwell, asthenia, abdominal pain, and nausea.
This results in yellowing of the skin and the eyes, the stools are clear, the urine becomes dark, and the healing can last for two or three weeks.
One year, one person worldwide dies of major morbidity, hepatitis B-induced liver cancer and liver suppression.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every ten infections are receiving medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can also lead to liver suppression, liver cancer.
Most infections do not even know their disease, because the cause of the disease is sublimely destroying the cells of the brain, in many cases only 20 to 30 years from now, the first symptoms will occur.
Then it is very important to prevent prevention and carry out regular tests.
In the mid-group, much more than usual is this type of debilitation: between people who have had blood transfusions before 1991, the gas consumption and the tattoos.
There are currently 200 million people in the world who are infected by the recombinant hepatitis C virus.
It may already be shown by a routine laboratory test, but it may be useful to contact your doctor if any of the side effects gets serious.
In time, the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thus causing its infectiveness and prevention of cancer.
September 30th is the world's day of hepatitis, which was first organized in 2004 by organisations around the world.
Its purpose is to draw attention to virus-induced inflammation of the liver, the causes of which and the importance of recognising the medicine.
Who the hell believes it hurts less?
Recent research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that could have already helped the death of Catholic martyrs.
Students at Oxford University have conducted an excellent experiment, and they have examined the way in which God influences people's sense of pain, according to the British Telegraph.
During a rather bizarre investigation, they gave 12 Catholic believers and both their own, while they were all studying a painting depicting a Virgin Mary.
The result is that Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
It was also evident from human brain scan that Catholics were able to trigger part of their brain that was responsible for harm control.
The study is the first in a series of research that, in addition to the academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians participate in a series of studies on behalf of the university.
The test was exactly the same as strengthening a sweating device to the left of the experimental subject, which supplied the electrosococcal force.
Researchers have encouraged those in the experiment to take a strong look at two paintings, the image of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the image of the Hermelinel of the Woman painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of Mary the Virgin would cause a religious state among the consuls, while the da Vinci was chosen because it was not thought to be too much of the other and soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour on an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electrosociety in four consecutive periods, either on the religious theme or on the general scene.
Catholics have reported that, while seeing Mary the Virgin, they "really" themselves, as they were "quieted" and "relaxed, rested, rested".
While looking at the religious subject, 12 per cent of the values reported were less than those seen in front of his own creation.
While Dr. Faias, a psychologist who was involved in the study himself, believes that the same effect can be achieved with any powerful image, only the right picture should be found for the atheists as well.
"We should find a way to make them feel really positive like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Mr. Wright's English bishop welcomed the results of the investigation.
"The definition of faith should be determined and, in many cases, it will change our personality," Wright said.
After the excellent results, the only question is, if you are an o-o or a similar pious painter, a madonna can show the image of the believers, how would it affect their behaviour?
Would the quality of the Virgin Mary‚Äôs vision bring even better results?
Or what you share about yourself.
On your tenth birthday, Google can tell you: people are at least just like their heads in the sky; you know where they've been, where they've been, where they've been, where they've been and what they care about.
This is still not enough Eric Schmidt, according to one of the main members of the Union.
However, as regards the scepticals that draw parallels from Orwell, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt's recent statement to the Financial Times that the purpose of Google is to collect even more personal data about their users, and this is necessary in order to be able to maintain the original purpose of the Google Founders, which said: "Let's get all the information in the world into the system."
According to Google, the Google operator mentioned, after three years of worldwide work, it is only at the outset that all the information can be handled.
The question that what will happen five years later, Schmidt said: Would you like Google to be able to answer questions such as "what do I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work should I do?" - but at the same time, the software cannot answer such simple questions because it does not know enough about users.
Not all online users are aware of the fact that search searches are searching for and search for an IP address.
The Personalized √™, launched two years ago, allows users to store their own surfing backgrounds, look back at what they're doing, click on what they're doing, and in the long term they're going to create much better customized finds - they'll be based on the Recommendations, which products, and we'll allow you to use our system on the basis of what you've told us and our preferences.
What if they use my data against me when they look at what I do? - ask users who are concerned about the Google Data Monopoly?
In most cases, the power exerted by the company can be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even a struggle against power, and can cause counter-reactions in the Internet.
It is confirmed, however, that the full set of terms is not laid down, but they may, where appropriate, be transferred to a third party; in such cases, there is nothing to protect the rights of the private sector.
The most recent example of this has perhaps been a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google passed on to the United States of America information on the Orkut community that it has maintained to the pedophiles on the Orkut community that it has provided, allowing for identification of the pedophiles.
On the other hand, social dialogues in need of social rights could still be called for in May, when the company failed to demonstrate its right to justice in court in the United States, with the help of the EFF's unit, on the other hand: Thus, Google cannot be considered to be obliged to provide any information that is secretly requested by the U.S. in any matter of the Constitution.
(At any rate, the federal government has successfully completed some 50 000 web addresses and thousands of search terms which have been referred to the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of children adopted years ago, but which have failed to provide for a complete list of websites and passwords for individual users and for a period of two months.)
It is quite controversial, therefore, that Google's opinion is that those who keep their personal data from being given are poised, because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy are diminishing by the fact that they are using Google's services and are reacting to tensions of migrants who appear in a conservative image.
Meanwhile, U.S. geek culture and its many countries, with its soulless computer associations, activists, users, sees the next generation of big companies as "the next corporeal" in them, compared to the usual, the world-renowned equivalent of Windows, although it works for the same purpose.
This may be because Google does not require an identifier code for any user, but requires no cash use, an open, free-of-charged, updated code and software packages to be more accessible, the youngest, and the most cooler user-friendly using the official software.
However, it may also be that the Gheeks can clearly see the very problem of the relationship between social rights and the Internet, which has been followed by the Internet 2.0, one of the most common passwords of recent years.
The website 2.0 is nothing more than a collation, that we deliberately leave clues behind and use the communication channels available to us, and while the extent of these is different for each individual, the point is that we do it.
A young person on several social sites may also have a profile from Facebook to Xang, which may also be linked to other services, such as Twitter or last.fm with its musical traditions, and then all of them may be connected to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which can also be connected to a blog that automatically displays their best archeries, which are stored on Flickr or Picasan.
While there are many possible cases that show up: the fact that it is difficult to realize the weather of the common circle of friends in the morning, seeing as it is difficult to figure out who his friend was spending the evening with or could fire a United States worker just because the truth of his opinion on senior management in his blog: a sure, private concept has been completely revalued to this day.
A person living online is what it says, what it is, of course, is the basis behind the behaviour of today's people.
But whatever wants to be secretive or at least wants to avoid Google's monopoly can do it (e.g. with Scroogle, who uses Google's system but does not want to leave it to him).
For example, the number of people who do not want to register on social sites without being able to access Google's online applications from editor to image editor and news may be replaced by alternative versions, which do not connect to giant servers and which do not combine the best version of the past with us.
The public is not so secretly waiting, Google looks like a tooth protein.
The company‚Äôs current value of $1,000,000 is worth more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (114 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising is a threat to the revenue of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an ever faster pace are a major headache not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
In addition, these critical considerations also reveal the disadvantages of the worrying: for example, the leadership has completely rejected the employee's objection, since it has doubled the corporate premium, the company has found it too costly to eat the employees more often every day, but all of it is taken away from the fact that in 2006 Google has made a head start before the Chinese Government and, in accordance with its agreement, the company has filtered out all the findings that violate the sense of good and the interests of the Chinese remembrance.
One of the company's internal rules says that they do not pre-announce a new service unless it is already in use, but it is certain that the foreseeable events of the next few months and years can change the world at a new point: while some people believe that the Google's book and magazine research project has been using a set of methods that the United States will soon have to face the Supreme Court in the United States, others are afraid of the system of the Health, and we can therefore provide a complete health relationship with our past findings, doctors and current events.
In fact, the fact that Google presents a genetic database also provides good raw materials for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novel Cory Doctorow novel, the Scroogled point orwelli notes the future that a person can only be easily approached from Google's data.
Aged aids for the long-term double-threshold killer in the background.
A young man was questioned by the police in the case of the double homicide in the county of Borsod, and it is clear that they were helping to cover the traces of the crime, said the spokesperson of the police headquarters in Borsod county on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged the burden-bearing activity and are currently being accused of criminal activities.
Two-ageers - MTI's information says they're defending two-year-olds on a curfew.
It is also possible to justify a period of imprisonment of up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder of a 23-year-old local man was placed in a pre-trial arrest on the day of his death.
He is charged with pre-designed, money-laundering, crimes of more than one person's crimes of human beings.
The study showed that the 23-year-old man owed a greater amount to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect was unable to settle the debt, and on Wednesday of the last seven weeks, his creditor was lured to a place of residence in the country where he was killed, along with his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man is on the move to commit the crime, which suggests that he committed murder with a hidden weapon at the scene.
The police will examine the circumstances of the weapon and its use with the involvement of experts.
The S√µsz√≥ Stock Offered to buy the Prussia Stock Exchange.
Two hundred million euros - about three billion Czech krona - is offered by the Warsaw stock exchange for the purchase of its share in the price of a price of 100 percent of the price in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Polish authorities despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czech Republic from the new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of shares are in the hands of the state, which requires more than 60 percent of the paper to be sold over a few months.
The 15 Czech marketing days know that the offer of Polish is the highest amount so far offered by the players for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech paper, so far, the World Trade Organisation, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Stock Exchange have offered an offer.
Kobli, the boss of the Prague stock exchange last year, has said that among the players, the value exchange would be the last new owner, and has not ruled out that this could lead to the destruction of the Prague stock exchange.
The value of the value of the priced price is estimated at 5 to 10 billion years by the market exporter.
Under the agreement of the signatories, approximately 90 percent of the securities could be purchased.
The largest owner of the Prague value exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a share of about 25 per cent, followed by Ceska Ooritelena Bank 14,7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. by 115 per cent.
From a European perspective, the financial system has a European dimension.
The European pages leading up to the ever deeper international financial crisis in their Tuesday comments are already saying "second September 11th".
We are responsible for the global financial disaster thanks to the President of the United States - accused of the Spanish La Repubblica - the President has not even been able to take his own side behind the legislative proposal of this wound, which is aimed at the medical treatment of the emergency situation...
Instead of another Pearl War, mentioned by Mr. Waren Buffett as a billionaire, it is best to talk about the second of September 11th.
Some of the Madris press sees crime in the Netherlands.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has led the world economy to the brink of collapse.
A woman is a threat to the collapse of the system, and this world can suffer.
After all, Mr. Bolh's plan was not perfect, but because of the vote in Congress, there is a risk that Washington would not offer a political instrument to deal with the development.
The world economy is on the other hand - just when one of the biggest transformations in the history of realism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be excluded - it looks like the Tages-Anzeig in Geneva.
States today can still provide rescue to nuclear financial institutions, and they can save them from bankruptcy by means of taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse in line with domino risks, neither the money nor the new ones will be sufficient.
In the long run, it is necessary that European Union Member States go beyond their national self-sufficientness and centralise controls on financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than 100 billion euros have been received by in need of money - reminds us of the tiny Der Standard, which says that there are more and more real problems that European taxpayers, like the US, have to go deep into their ground for the benefit of today's medicine.
So far, the EU has not taken any serious account of the world that is sweeping through the continent.
"Safetymen" do not have to spend every billion euros, but it would be good if they recorded: in which case, it is reasonable to use taxpayers' money to prevent any harm.
The flight of the dogo is driven by the intelligent car.
What would be the best way to avoid contact if it were not to imitate obstacles in the world of nature?
For example, bees have bees.
In the surprising project presented by the CEETEC, which is currently under way, the doggones have given the strategic starting point to Nissan's engineers in order to see how the next generation of back-to-back systems could be established.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan built the BR23C-type diagnostic autorotation control system, a nuclear mini-car that was given to bee properties, with the aim of promoting the development of a system that eliminates conflict.
During the flight, all bees develop their own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our security shield - explained at the exhibition by Kazuhhiro Doi, Director General of Technology, PR- and Research Development.
Its role is important to the complex eye of the colossal eye, which in all directions can see more than 300 degrees in perspective.
To mimic that complex eye function, the inspectors touched the laser distance.
This identifies the obstacles within a distance of 2 metres in a 180-degree field before BR23C, taking into account their distance and sending a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which is converted into an immediate action to avoid contact.
During the seconds of the breakage, the obstacle is detected, and the autobots, mimicking the movements of the mantle, immediately alters the wheels by turning them away to avoid contact.
Unlike any of the current systems, this next day is a very simple day.
"If that were not the case, the car robot would not be able to respond quickly to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the driver of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot.
It must act in a simple and immediate manner, since this system is the most vulnerable and internal layer of security shields, an element in which the collision is currently considered impossible.
The whole process must reflect what one does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in a blink.
However, unlike bees, the derogation should not take place either upwards, downwards or flat, it must be only two-dimensional, and only for the purpose of driving the wheels.
In this way, only the current movement and acceleration, as well as the slowdown, have been used as an option to use the autorobe to avoid other bees.
BR23C uses lithium polymer accumulators, which are easier and more energy-intensive, which means they have a longer life than lithium-ion version.
And according to this, an intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process or store data at all.
Each of these devices needs to process and react to some of the signals.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous Mays, so it uses only a few dozen kilos of memory.
There is no need for any of these, or even memory-size memories.
This is the first step towards the development of an immediate-release technology that, according to Nissan's estimate, could be involved in the emergency cars within 10 years.
Use of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an option to avoid obstacles to the road to the maximum.
He also had a name for the poison-sized child.
A written version of the multi-use economic rescue package of $7 billion to buy bad loans from banks has been completed.
First, the money is spent.
At the time of the Eastern Party, during the talks that lasted until midnight on Saturday, Congress leaders have reached a critical stage in the debate on the whole $700-dollar rescue package for days - Reuters reported.
We have made real progress," said Nancy Pelosi, President of the United States of America, who says that there is only enough left for the agreement to be signed.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidents, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Prime Minister Henry Paulson said that the compromise was going to work and that the programme would work and be effective, but there are other tasks to be done, so it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the car of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the 8th in the evening of the Asian market in Washing (morning from the middle of the country at two o‚Äôclock a.m.), but did not cause any visible rise in the market.
The first vote on the law is on Monday on the draft economic emergency law for 2008 and then on the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi the other night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are committed to making progress this evening and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
The programme, by the way, is contrary to the basic proposal of Bush administration, which would have meant that $7 billion would be spent on the purchase of better, credit-backed securities at one time.
For the first time, a total of half of the $7 billion can be spent by using 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance buys bad shares with a credit background, and another $100 billion is due to the decision of the President.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will participate.
The waste of the other half of the billionaire depends on the second decision of the United States.
Under the law, the Finance Ministry can use combined tactics: it can buy bad loans, loans and mortgage-backed goods at the same time, as well as other forms of "toxic" loans.
The purchase is made in the context of and directly via the auction - the Ministry's jurisdiction is expressed.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the stock ensures the protection of the cause of concern, for which the companies pay a corresponding fee to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means to avoid a systemic risk associated with either their insurance or the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law, as soon as it is signed - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks in trouble and waiting for state aid can expect the government to restrict their withdrawal money, which is called the overseas slang, which is called the "move" of gold.
Payments are restricted only in certain cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In fact, the problem means that if the Ministry is using it, they're putting extra taxes on the gold parachute, unless the bank manager is called in.
At the time of the purchase of bad loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the management money is not overburdened.
The picture adds that the current gold parachute agreements do not change, but only new ones are concerned with indicating their participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history that there is a legal prohibition on the remuneration of directors and directors - she commented on the measure by the President of the House's Financial Services Committee, the Democratic Party Barney Frank.
In all the banks involved in the programme, the State acquires the right to purchase, so that the risk of taxpayers is reduced, which may ultimately win the transaction as the economy and the bank together is in a position to cope with it.
The draft law provides that the President should submit an application to the International Bureau for the following five years, indicating how the taxpayer can recover the expected losses from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who doubted the plan.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us to do, that is, it does not protect taxpayers' dollars - stated by the representative of the Republican Republic of Darrell Issa, California.
A Democrat colleague in Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thought that the measures were the same as those responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices have increased further.
In August 2008, sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 per cent from the previous month, compared to August 2007, by 12.9 per cent - the KSH is reported.
Industrial export sales prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to the previous one year.
Domestic and export price changes were mainly industrial producer prices by 0.7 per cent in the previous month and by 3.2 per cent in the previous one year.
The sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimal extent, by 0,1 %, compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the IT sectors have increased only to a small extent by 0.1 per cent in July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product industry in the ordinary industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to a monthly increase in prices of 4.6 per cent and 2 per cent of the production of bags, shingles and tableware.
The high price level of plastic and chemical materials has led to a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product production (1,6 %).
There was a decrease in the price of oil processing (1,4 %), the production of electrical machinery and instruments (in %) and - at least - wood processing (0,1 %).
The prices of paper, printing, printing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other integrating industries, we measured a price increase between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors, which represent a significant factor in the total sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly as a result of the long-term impact of the increase in domestic prices in July.
Compared to the twelve-month period, prices (32,4 per cent) increased to the highest in the total sales of the statistics sectors in the twelve-month period.
In the production of the like product, there was a price increase of 13,2 % in the total food, drink, and food production.
There was a fall in prices in the textile, textile production (in %) and the production of electrical machinery and instruments (0,3 %) in the sector.
In the other sectors of the economy, the rate of price increase was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
In the manufacturing industry, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the last year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent a year earlier.
In the general market, the largest monthly price increase (in %) of investment goods was found in the sector of the exporting sector in August among the sub-groups of sectors of the sector.
Consumer goods increased by 0.3 per cent in the manufacturing sectors, and did not change in the energy and spare production sectors in the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8%).
In the manufacturing sector, the consumer goods were increased by 6.8 per cent and the investment goods by 1.4 per cent.
In the month of last month, the export sales prices of the industry in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent and decreased by 3.9 per cent in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency decreased by 1 percent from the euro over a month, by 7.1 percent compared to the USD, by 4 percent compared to the euro in August 2007, by 15.9 percent compared to the US dollar.
Don't you need a visa in the United States next year?
G√∂ncs√§ sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force on 12 January - the Foreign Minister of this country in Chicago, spoke before the leaders of the local folklore.
He believes that "now everything depends on whether or not the electronic inlet or control system exists at a time beyond the sea".
At the same time, he pointed out that in the new system, there will be no travel permit, but tourists will have to register themselves before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomat has been negotiating in Denmark since today.

The bank rescue is located next to Barack Obama and McCain.
Mr Barack Obama and Mr John McCain, the President-in-Office of the two major U.S. parties, both provided support for the government's $700 billion bail-in grant, but there is a political need to resign the Minister of Finance.
Convention and administrative representation days were announced in the morning after the negotiations on the year-old marathon: a basic agreement on the bail-out package was reached.
The Wall Street and the General Package for the Exploration of the Frozen Credit Market have become the central issue of the co-chair campaign.
Both Obama and McCain show themselves: it is best for a partner to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
Recent surveys show that Obama has once again gained some advantage, with the exception of economic considerations, the advantage of McCain, with Sarah Palin's vice-president after the Republic Convention.
Obma expressed her hope at a detrot event on Sunday that the law on the $7 billion package will be adopted quickly by the Congress.
It stresses that the proposal includes the consumer protection passports, which he also supported.
"We must now act responsibly (...) to threaten your job, your savings, your entire industries, the stability of the entire economy," said the 35th World War.
He did not forget to call McCain's economic ideas a "time-depreciated".
Mr. McCain said to the ABC in a case, "We're all going to have a hard time swallowing it (...) but it's not a easy way to go.
The Republican Senator has announced that it is proposed to set up a Committee of the Minister of Finance and to restrict the payment of seniority, which he has proposed.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role to play in the reconciliations, but he was involved with the minister.
President Pelosi said that the House is expected to vote on the proposal for a law on Monday.

In the online release of the German news media on the left, Franz Walter, the Bajoran Revolution, is an analysis of the causes of the dramatic defeat of Csu.
It is well-known that Chu's erosion was already well-informed before the returnee Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
Throughout the world, the world has been renewing the country of Bajor, and these modern roles are now changing.
The change of age is also the problem of the whole of Christian democracy, as well as the problem of Angela Merkel.
The fact was not quite surprising for Chu, but on Sunday it was a process that almost ten years ago was likely to happen: it changed the undisputed hegony of a party in the state.
For ten years, in 1998, Csu landed at 47,7 per cent, first of all during the fifty years during the 50s at 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundle Member elections, but all of which was mentioned in the Stoic era.
As a result, the continuous modernisation carried out by Csu in the region, which eats up the parent, is a result of which is consistently implemented by Csu.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the moment you are mistaken. However, there can be no consequences for the respondents Csu's loyalty to secularization, educational outcomes, the entry of eastern and northern Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernization is accompanied by an increase in potential, and its political consequences are also visible.
The right-wing third party, but only within the inside, have the voters become more self-conscious, the more self-conscious, the more self-righteous.
It is also noticeable that in the last few weeks, in particular, the dual civil society staff has most of all disappeared from Chu; liberal, industrial, graduate and higher-ranking staff.
There's already been 40 percent of the Chu's support.

He wrote in the conservative newspaper "Who, with whom? The co-chairs on the reinvigorated coalition issues" about the state of affairs of domestic policy after the election.
The FEA wants to deal with the EVP.
The √ñVP prohibits access to the Home Affairs Department.
The truth is that the negotiations are open to all directions, the men do not yet agree on the coalition.
The choice, now everything is about the coalition; in the debate in the public service context, it is unlikely that the leaders would allow you to look into their card.
President Werner Fayman found out that he wanted to deal with the √ñVP.
The SYR also wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - in some periods and in social partnership.
The question is whether you can imagine a coalition with Mr Wilhelm Molter - the current President of the √ñVP, as you can imagine an early mayor - was left behind by Fayman.
As you say, the Sch√ºssel-Molter course has been proposed anyway.
Repeating this direction is not a point of discussion.
Molter has reacted with urgency to the red offers.
As he said, it will certainly not be effective if Faymann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the √ñVP.
As a party to the opposition chooses or joins the coalition, the party is at its disposal, the questions must be discussed within the √ñVP.
President J√∂rj Haider BZ√ñ has repeatedly turned out to be open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to accept government responsibility," said Hader.

Today, in the United States, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities began this year as its host representing the European Union's EU Presidency.
Ms L√≠via J√≥√≥ka, the European People's Party's Party's High Representative, pointed out, in the knowledge of one of the main spokesmen of the technical advice, that this was one of the most serious rights and, moreover, the most important obstacles to their exposure to children.
A high level of protection - on behalf of the French Presidency - is provided by Mr Xavier Bertrand, Minister for Trade and Social Affairs, and Mr Vladimir Studentla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European defence and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities are invited to the Council.
J√≥√≥ka ‚Äì according to the press office of the Fidesz EP delegation ‚Äì warned that, in addition to income, Roma are mainly responsible for low education in the labour market.
"The vast majority of young people do not have a middle-aged degree, and because of poor basic education, only a small proportion of them can get a higher education."
It has also underlined that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role to play in the enforcement of other rights.
Early childhood education can help to strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the representative, it is necessary to make these relations known the most widely - between the Roma and the non-Roma.
In fact, as much as European students begin school, women are at risk of becoming productive members of the labour market; they contribute through income and consumer taxes to the public budget.
"The Roma must have the right to quality education and to prevent the elimination of their low-quality and individual education", said L√≠via J√°r√≥ka.
According to the representative, it is necessary to combine the European Union's objective and action-oriented approach with a view to speeding up the school's desegregation processes immediately, and it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly enforced.
"you need to break the evils of poverty, segregation, unemployment, you need to give the child the help of a child with the opportunity to make a full contribution to the future of Europe," said J√°r√≥ka.
In the context of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been in place since last year in Berlin, aims to ensure that the objectives of equality and non-discrimination at European and national level are fully respected.
Csu: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of Duo Huber-Beckstein, who has been taken over.
The ugly election falls have not yet been the subject of the debate on personal matters at the very end of the Bajor Chu.
Mr. Erwin Huber and Mr. G√ºnze Beckstein State Prime Minister may still be in position to ask how long my grace lasts.
On the last weekend of the last week, the fate of the 17-percent disaster-absorbing class will be decided by an extraordinary couple's struggle.
In any case, many of the members of the critics felt that they did not insist on all their strengths.
They tried to calm down the group and base anger members, who, one day, demanded personal consuls after the "bajor cunami" because of the loss of the real majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the Stoiber coup, it only ran 43.4 percent of their power.
For 46 years, Csu has been a "one-manent" in Bajorland taxing 18 percent of German GDP.
Meanwhile, the conservatives continue to rely heavily on the Hungarian economy in the south of all, and in the future, they will need a coalition.
One of the first examples of the bilateral transformation is that of Mr. Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is a potential successor of Huber, will also be in the middle of the ongoing reconnaissance strike, which will begin negotiations with free alternatives to a possible government coalition in Munich with the liberal FDP and along with the right-wing values.
It's a hell of a lot of fun that the One of the Free Citizens has access to the law, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber has been used by Huber-Beckko as a couple of pussies, and they've dealt with the most ambitious domestic politician in the country.
Chu's leaders are now making every effort to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
The transition will play an active role in this process, as well as Stoiber from behind, the former Prime Minister and former President of Chu, in the name of 28 September as the smallest day of his political career as former Prime Minister and former President of Chu.
On Monday, he made a few comments to the PCU, and he said he deserved much more support from the couple.
Other policies in Csu meant losing, that the warning for both the CDU and Angela Merkel was also meant losing.
After the elections to the Bundestag in January 2009, no chance of being a chancellor shall be made if the Csu, which is a truly important player in the 2005 country, does not seem to be able to cope with it together.
It is difficult for the fiasco to be deceived by Merkel that Chu's defeat will not have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is most relative: the wounded Chu will not be easy to handle, and the social democracies will continue to endure.
The SPD has achieved 18.6 percent of its lowest ever since in Bavaria.
Lukasenko-Question: 110-0000
No member of the opposition entered the Commonwealth following the day's election.
According to the Russian authorities, this was led by Aleksandr Lukasenko, which is responsible for prosperity and stability, but according to the European Economic and Social Committee (EEA), it is clear that the offences committed in the course of the polling process were illegal.
The 43 EEAS that sent out a checkout from today did not accept the elections.
Although the ten-hundred-person law of the 10 million countries has been advocating the opposition for a decade, before yesterday's elections, the United Nations Democratic Force (UN) was seriously hoping that, as a result of the amendment to the Constitution, Lukasenko, the Presidential Council of the 2006 elections, which had been vitiated in absolute force, would once again be renewed by Lukasenko, who 'allows' some opposition representatives in Parliament.
The U.S. has therefore ceased from the pre-determined boycott.
Against the backdrop of the opposition expectations, Russia's economically less dependent country of Central Russia, which has borrowed loans for the reduction of persistent Russian gas imports and has contributed to the Russian influx of Yugoslavia with transit pipelines, has also made it necessary to improve its status with the EU, where Lukasenko and several major politicians do not receive an entry permit because of the anti-democratic Russian political action.
It has been noted that, in the course of the election campaign, the ESF has made the most of the positive movements, not the shortcomings, such as the prohibition of one third of the opposition candidates from the start.
However, the OSCE's urgent report on Monday has already objected to the campaign - during which the opposition indicators were not really present today - and in particular that the opposition did not appear in the vote accounts.
In addition, it is also clear in the political system that political prisoners have been released and that Minsk has been subjected to a minor conflict with Moscow, and that it continues to deny the recognition of South-Oystia and Abkhazia, which is deported from Georgia, even though Russia - the United States of Great Britain - now considers the two territories to be independent.
- We took two steps ahead, one behind, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Russia and the EU has started - said Aleksandr Mininkevich.
According to the statement of opposition to the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain the case, despite the fact that "the power was feared by the fact that it would allow itself to enter a false parliament as a result of an act of opposition".
The opposition does not intend to oppose actions in response to the results, but seeks to send a message of the need for economic reforms to the respondents.
- Of course, we have a lot of problems, we need to print the opposition papers in Russia, the local authorities are creating barriers to the presentation, but I also see that more and more people are supporting change, including the elderly, as Miinkevich said, indicating that Lukasenko's regime, which is considered to be a major result of the creation of social security, does not seem to be adequate even for the most recently supported pensioners.
- The debt of the country, due to the increase in trade deficit, is due to the break-up of social security in the "memorial silence" - said Milinkevs.
In contrast to the opposition policy, the Russians hold the elections to the police.
Sergei Leb√°v, the Head of the Mission of the Community of the United States of America, told the State's Nym≈±sty Russian news agency: "It is not the words, it is people who believe in actions," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than evidence of the head of the Russians.
Quoted by: "Employment of exceptional hours at work".
In fact, the Chigi Palace has been equipped with unique doorways for the out- and-out-of-work of the workers.
From today on, this new measure will take effect against the good people, the screening of those who block and then go out and have a cup of coffee at work.
The anti-day news was presented today by Renato Brunetta Minister and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Ministerial Office.
"The gateways," said Brunetta, "are intended to help improve and improve working conditions, help to reduce deficits and improve services."
"a new, more responsible and more transparent period follows.
This is the real reform" - highlighted Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete all the buildings of the Ministerial Council.
According to Masi, "incorporation of doors is also symbolically important."
On behalf of the employees, we have not experienced any opposition - confirm the Secretary-General: "The workers have approved the action, all in cooperation."

At the Public Administration College,
At a meeting held at the Minister's meeting, the Minister said: "In the course of the month, 50 percent of the public sector's deficits have been reduced due to illness, which means that in a year, tens of thousands of people have been employed more than one job."
At the same time, it did change the need to make the national public administration more efficient.
"which, according to the Minister, has been twice as high as the private sector in the last 8 years and has exceeded the inflation rate by far.
Each of the few members of the public has gathered together to join the submissions supported by the Community of the Community of the Environment and Consumer Protection Communities to object to the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Public Administration boasts data to help reduce sickness-related deficiencies, the war of 'untiring suns' is constantly growing" - says the community of the environment.
In the first place, thousands of ordinary and law-abiding civil servants have gathered together to declare war on the illegitimate requirements of this Regulation."
The regional court is, inter alia, faced with the abolition of supplementary nutrition payments for underlying diseases, the length of residence of civil servants on leave, which means the period during which the presence may take place and other new aspects required by the Minister.
On-the-job accidents: According to Napolitano, prevention is important in all respects.
Every day, there are 2 jobs in every single day, of which 3 are disabled and 27 are permanently disabled.
According to the accident insurance report at work, almost one hundred deaths occurred in 2007 at work.
The numbers bear witness to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and almost demands a victim like murder.
Today's Anmil 58th day is the day of accidents at work in all regions of the country of the country on the second day of the previous year, calling for the attention of the institutions, social organisations and the public to be paid to this dramatic problem.
"The alarm data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, support the fact that prevention has an extremely important role to play in the event of accidents at work," said President of the Republic of Naples Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Republic of Georgia, in his address to the President of the Association of the Athletic Disasters at Work.
The Head of State also agreed on "the association's commitment to preventing work, protecting workers affected by accidents, helping victims' families and giving a strong voice to the public".
"There is a natural and honest upheaval in the face of such a type of upset, in which the media and the public are also interested, but in reality we have to face dramatic, repeated and repeated events on a daily basis."
Napolitano openly states: "We have a lack of resources, the financing of education and information is crucially important.
Particularly important are school-based initiatives, which aim to provide direct information to young people who are about to enter the world of work.
We must maintain interest in the phenomenon, not allow attention to be paid to the social importance of the issue, and we need better legislation that needs to be enforced.
The president, Mr. Gianfranco Fini, pointed out on his behalf that "the importance of accidents at work resulting in retirement, all of us having a conscience, is of social importance, and each of the institutions is to put an end to this as soon as possible."
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of such deaths is still incredibly high", stated Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"there is no doubt, on the other hand, that this declining trend would result in considerable consideration, because the attention of the greatest tragedy happens."
"We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything possible to overcome the phenomenon, which could be resolved through an action programme.
We believe that more supervision and control should be needed - he stressed Mercandelli - as well as more intensive intervention in the field of labour market education, starting with education and training."
"There is a need for further efforts to inform the public and to keep the public informed", he said.
What is most important, however, is a more responsible environment for employment in a context that represents a social dimension."
Mr Mercandila then criticised "the gradual deterioration of the safety net for the victims of accidents at work" and "the assistance plan towards which the system has been running recently".
"The reason is that we should give workers the security of insurance, because the fate of the victims of an accident should not depend on the legislator where it is arbitrary, where it is based on the tasks of a staff member".
Hearing damage may be caused by MP3 players.
Keeping hearing damage may result in prolonged and high volume silence of portable instruments such as MP3 devices -
Report back to you: The European Commission, based on today's opinion of the Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SENIHR) published by the European Commission today.
"It is clear from the opinion that 5-10 per cent of those who have permanent mortality effects for more than one hour a day, with a high volume of voice, can be read in the explanation."
"The fact that young people who use high-telephony portable musical players and mobile phones are not aware of the fact that unreversibly damaging their hearings," said Kuneva.
"Scientific studies pose an unmistakable risk, which we urgently need to respond to," said the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to provide consumers with the best information and to expand the wide range of information on this issue.
In the light of this advice, we should also review the existing control systems in order to be able to operate and keep up to date with the latest developments in terms of effectiveness".
author asked the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the availability of portable musical players and the increase in the number of young people who were exposed to accidents.
"Researchers will encourage us to have cause for concern, and the Commission, in consultation with Member States and stakeholders, will be willing to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people exposed to the risk of exposure by mobile players and other means", said the Committee member.
The current European Safety Regulation sets a maximum level of exclusivity to be issued by portable musical players in 100 dB, and therefore there is a strong concern about hearing impairment due to the over-use of such sound resources.
There are solutions for the Union, such as the determination of the level and duration of exposure, which can significantly reduce these hearing damage.
In the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, it states that those who use a portable player who listens to a high voice (more than 89 decibels) every week for a period of five weeks will not be affected by the current maximum value for noise in the workplace.
If a person has a prolonged duration of time, after five years there will be a risk of permanent death.
This is about 5-10 percent of the mobile devices users, which in the EU can also account for 2.5-10 people.
Mr. Alemano will set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital city.
Today, until today, the results are expected in June.
This schedule was set out by the Capital Municipality for the operation of the Committee "The Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at the new location behind the Caracalla bath.
The next month, President Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will draw up their directives.
After March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and the General Committee to be able to submit in June an official capital plan officially approved by the Prime Minister General of the Government and Gianni Alemandi.
"It is a fully independent committee, which represents all political, social and cultural ideas - I would like to call for Alemino - to come up with proposals for the development of the Single Market, on which political decision-makers, such as the General Assembly and the Committee of the Government, can rely.
There is no legal conflict of interest; we just wanted a platform where big plans for the benefit of Rome could have been made.
Since he has done so, the Committee will be disbanded because it has a term of office for a period of time.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan for the work of the Committee on the future of Rome's home capital - the Prime Minister said.
For those who consider the Commission to be superfluous, as a result of the fact that the advice it has issued is not binding, Alemano says: "All depends on what the Commission will do and on what quality it will make on the table.
If it is of the right quality, as is the case in France for the Committee on the Environment, which I am sure of, it will be an important contribution.
The strength of the policy is often fragmented in the management of day-to-day matters and in the management of urgent cases of time.
On the other hand, we will take a further perspective and plan for the longer term and will work towards the development and future of the Union", taking into account the future aspects."
He wishes to point out that "this Commission is not sure to be a useless 'fluid', since it is absolutely free, the citizens of Europe will not be charged with any euro, but it will be an incentive and will aim to involve the most outstanding people in the capital".
According to Lemanino, "there is a need for an open and flexible strategic framework that enables our city to make a high-quality leap that it needs so much, thinking about its future in a single world."
On the future, which was highlighted by the Mayor of Rome, "it is not only limited to the current administrative framework but also far away", we see not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also "the role it can play as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region, and what it must do."
Obama, the first anti-American man, we'll show you why.
"Barack Obama is going to be the second anti-American.
It was the first Jimmy Carter to destroy the American economy with his decision and maintain close relations (as he does today as he does today) with the enemy Islam."
As the election time approaches, attacks against Obama will become more frequent.
One lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Omaha thinks in a senseable way that he can gain the universal public dignity of a nation that has so far been two governors and five senators!"
These attacks are actually unspeakable; of course, they are racist, but they do not answer the issue of vote, whether it will be a good president. Then we have the public opinion polls: it indicates that Obama will win, with a significant advantage.
In this case, there are people who listen to their emotions and not to their minds.
In the south of the United States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its lead: we are well aware that the actual American patriot casts his vote at the polls.
There is a side of American thinking that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just tell me what you want, and we'll know where to put it on the base, Obama or McCain."
There are those who fear that if Obama succeeds, they will leave the United States.
They have never said such words until now, when the achievement of the black mark is absolutely certain.
However, despite all these developments, the democratics are a powerful weapon of George Bush.
1 500 people asked about the mistakes made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent said that Iraq.
Transmigration.
This nation lost 5,000 soldiers in Korea, and it was thrown to the ground that it flew to the ground.
In Chicago, 45,000 soldiers lost their lives, and the U.S. didn't have to pack.
However, most people think that Iraq was the weakness of Bush.
A huge task awaits the man who will replace George W.
The United States: economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and it is also time for pressure in the editorials. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW researcher asked five hundred American journalists how they felt about the future situation and spiritual power of their profession.
Well, right now, all journalists have a pssimism about their own future.
However, it has not been clear that it would have been credible.
They do not feel as isolated as they are now.
The problem with American journalists is money.
They believe that 2008 is the bankruptcy of a powerful economic model.
There is a serious problem with newsroom, i.e. restrictions on newspaper editors.
If you do not mean that traditional journalism, in the sense that what is meant by the public is to shrink to a minimum, this must be solved - says the inquisitive journalists.
Today, well-seen and complex nuismity is a factor in American journalism.
Sixty percent of press journalists and senior leaders are convinced that the European jury is wrong.
In place, 65% of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed press press.
Press staff are not faced with difficulties to see where the world network is going.
The biggest publishers are pushing for themselves on the Internet, which many believe is the "suicide" of the print press.
Journalists' sense of "economic pressure" increased to 79 per cent.
The 500 journalists in the paper admitted that the technology would make a difference, in the hope that it would only be in favour of the journalist.
Today, in the US police, there is a gap between the editors, i.e. the directors and the informants.
At national level, 56 percent of the leaders are sure that their informants will share information with others, while at local level this ratio can only be done at 23 percent.
Some of these good jobs are linked to them.
At a national level, 47 percent of the leaders fear that they will be able to work within three years.
In the case of journalists, this is 30.
In other words, "employment" is on the agenda on an equal footing (in the case of our editors, etc.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a huge nation such as the United States of America of 300 million people, where thousands of magazines, magazines, radio, television and Internet services operate, employers are usually offered as much as they can, so it works on a "need or do not have to" basis.
Directors generally receive a high salary and editors can make ten thousand dollars per month in addition to pension and health insurance premiums.
However, the exemption is rather complicated: the first day of day x, in the third day it is, until it reaches its maximum 15 days for a certain period of time.
But American journalists, according to their own declaration, often "be quiet" during the year.
All function functions.
UNI: ROOM'S COURT: ANNILO COPOLA GROTTERRABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Division of the European Court of Justice, rejected the request from Danilo Coppola, who was working in the real estate business, who was forced to pass through his home from Grottaferrata to a single apartment in the United States.
Coppol is facing an economic bankruptcy in the context of an investigation into a contract between the Union and BELT.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, the house arrest was lifted and turned into a residence ban for the Grottaferrata.
Lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, requested that the real estate business should be able to pass through the town's capital home from a rural town.
However, in law, these transactions (for which the prosecutor has proposed an advocacy) allow the company to influence and access the evidence it has brought against it.
Elite is in danger.
The phenomenon was known a few days ago, when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $7 billion rescue package that was put in place by the House of the United States: the Americans are much more interested and still deserve to be punished by Wall Street as saving the economy.
This is supported by the New York Times yesterday, which tells us that the current crisis has caused a break in the Republican Republican Party, which is increasingly giving rise to a great deal of favor in the traditional, repressive, eastern attitude to support the federal institutions and business circles and in the Central and South States, which are becoming increasingly strong, anti-D Washington and financial world-wide.
This direction has been demonstrated in a way that is reflected in the Parliamentary vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, this event is just one of the important changes that the economic transformation that is still ongoing suggests or allows to see, and not only in the United States, but in the world, but also in the world.
It seems that the world, both in the United States and in Europe, is just speeding up those long-time flying phenomena in this new atmosphere, and they are finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the modernisation, the return to public knowledge of the dual category of state sovereignty, as regards a kind of modernisation of the economy.
The crisis concerns banking financial institutions that maintain close contact with the rest of the world, however, first and foremost, and, rather widely, involve people and families that live in one country, in the same country, in the same country.
This is a primary political challenge for the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who, in particular, are electives.
In economic terms, the economy seems to be global, but in political terms it is essentially national.
Political internationality seems to have been essentially out of line: this is evidence of the European Union, which, by definition, is not a coherent policy approach between different interests and different national policies.
So all the different national governments are asking for help, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but above all the opening of funds: whereas, in reality, only the individual states have an economic base, a set of assets that can make things right.
They also have their instruments and their powers to use them: in circumstances, they have two invaluable assets, which are likely to have no other market nor any other international organisation, to such an extent.
In addition, the new emphasis placed on the state of the United States by the crisis is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times has given rise to an increasing importance to a factor that is closely linked to this: this is the territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we are convinced that we have already entered the network, the most sophisticated technology in the world of principle, and we are convinced that the global global world has determined that it has ruled the world, once we have just noticed that our future is more or less dependent on what is needed than water, crop and oil.
From what can be transported from one side of the planet to the other, it can still be completely linked to a restricted location, a site.
So, whoever controls the area has far more bats than the one who was in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I would also like to pass on to the second novelty, which is a kind of hybrid.
Who says it's territory, state, government, it's basically saying, "political, in other words, driving."
In this regard, it seems that economic today is producing two mutually consonant phenomena:
For one part, it is an objective recognition of the need for credible driving, someone who can deliver the events.
On the other hand, the current management, in particular the management of economic leaders, has resulted in total losses, which have turned out to be completely inappropriate and have proved to be a very long way ahead of them.
The two together are of even greater importance and, in some respects, more worrying: the feeling of credit loss, injustice, inability and isolation, which is affecting the whole leadership of the world in more countries.
It seems that the population is becoming increasingly convinced that the social life of the community has expired so far. It has expired, before they have done, experienced, lifestyle, education, word for word, they would have made it their own. This social elite is becoming more and more alien from the opinion of a majority.
In other words, there is a demand for leadership, in the form of a wide-ranging but powerful delegitimate movement which is contrary to the dominant position and to the traditional political system. This vote is not expected to be "in the 'public' spheres', or in recent times the sudden changes in the public voice. For example, the power of conservators in Austria and Bavaria, the social unit conflict in Great Britain, or the opposition of the American congressors to Bush (and perhaps even the best of the US) can be identified here).
It seems that its traditional elites, parties, programs, and even it might say that, in all its customs, media and well-known intellectuals, it does not mean anything, but it is less able to represent what has been going on for some time in the deeper part of the society of the world. Moreover, the economic crisis is getting stronger, spread and is really able to make even more vague thoughts.
Nevertheless, speaking of "the imminent rebellion of the masses", it would be too much to say.
But it's okay to walk with your eyes open.
We can walk a strong glue on the wall.
A strong glue can help you overcome gravity and walk around the wall like Spiders.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to the solution.
With a single half-meter glue, the researchers managed to tape and hold a 100-pound body on a vertical wall.
A copy of the U.S. journal JULM√ÅNY - Science has been published by some of the researchers at the Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance invented by the study group has been developed further by the development of existing special so-called ‚Äòcarbon-carbon‚Äô solids that are already in existence.
"The principle of glue operation must be thought of as a pipe system similar to a package of spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher of the Georgian Institute of Technology in Atlanto, Georgia.
Researchers from the gecko, covered with microscopic pads, covered his feet with the idea of providing a good impact on the animal.
Tests carried out with various materials, such as e.g., nebula, teflon and sanders, have shown that the new glue is ten times better than the feet of the said reptiles, but it is also easy to separate from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton.
FALON COME? - "The matter of temporary adhesives can be useful", adds Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Yes, but researchers are thinking more of a less impressive use than the connection of electronic devices, because coal pipes are good for the heat and electricity.
You can also use it in your medicine.
The heroes can wait.
OTHER INFORMATION - The University of Berkeley, California, is also conducting experiments with a new glue substance.
According to an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists have presented an adhesive made of a hair-like, micro-fibre material that undergoes self-conceived movement on the surface, thus always providing a perfect impact.
Medications? Fruit juice is prohibited.
Care must be taken of graefruit, eel and almmals.
These high-vitamin drinks, especially in the summer, where they enter the body with certain life-saving medicines, contribute to their absorption, thus increasing or reducing the effect, which may also have serious effects on the drug.
The professor at the University of Western Ontario, London, called attention to the risks of combined use of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products. The President announced at the American Chemical maple meeting in Philadelphia in 236 countries: one cup of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicinal products, thus preventing good effects and risking the health of the patient.
Grapefruit has already been placed on the bench of the defendants when it appeared that it is able to control some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety, heart rhythm control and medicine to be toxic.
KOCK√ÅZATOSURKES - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Forestry itself published the news in its official notice and warned doctors and patients that they should take seriously the risks associated with these interactions and that they should take into account what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO ONLY GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, oranges and apples contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
How can it be said that the active substances are the ones that affect the absorption of grapefruit and other juices?
Calls attention to Michele Carruba, Professor at the Department of Medicine of the University of Milan: "The findings of this kind are usually immediately addressed to various national and international medical institutions, who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in the information provided by this medicinal product is changed.
This is why it is always necessary to provide the pharmacist for this medicine and, if something is not clear, let us do not let it affect ourselves or let our pharmacist or pharmacist be protected" - said Ansa, the expert of Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the economic Nobel Prize.
The U.S. Paul Krugman was awarded the Economic Nobel Prize for the analysis of trade markets and economic and territorial contexts.
55-year-old neokeynes√≠nus Krugman, a Princeton University, is a well-known publisher of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the least critics of economic and foreign policy measures of the government of the country.
A few months after the August IV attack in Egypt, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in his main article, which was launched in the New York Times, that the latest event would have even more profound consequences than the collapse of twin towers in the history of the United States.
This forecast did not raise a few debates, most of the time it was taken into account by the economy, but today we know that it was true.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked that Enron or Worldcom's scandalous collapse has gone over the public interest", said Krugman at the end of 2002.
Member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, according to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Krugman is a "poor-valued economist", but he is quite "expressive in style of his criticisms of the excessive liberalisation of the British Government."
Open Office, the third edition is worth the "anti-Microsoft" package.
Today, an open program-code application package that increases productivity of people.org 3.0, which, as a free alternative to Internet Office, aims at a wider range of aspects, from home to US users, to public administration.
The new Open Office has been under the supervision of SUN Microsystem and has been working for almost a year now by voluntary developers, and the new Open Office is bringing more new ones to the public: in addition to the next screen and the newest, less advanced user interface, it offers more important new ones. For example, the compatibility with Apple Mac OS X system and the new ISO standard ODC (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Particular attention has been paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can also open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
There are also a few modules that have specific functions, such as that which allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoints. This can be useful for sending files by e-mail. Another feature supports importing PDF files into a directory by setting the local layout.
In addition, we can also create "hybrid PDF" documents which provide some standard format for using user or text editor elements.
The distribution of applications has also gone through a number of developments: the template supports the common use of working notes, but prevents the modification of one another's work. Each work's comments are defined in different ways, which in the control section will help to make it easier to identify.
Some companies have already been working to make some of their features available on the Internet (is the cloud, on the planet), so the next one is likely to be presented in the final version.
The Italian version, which has been added to the myrror pages since next Friday, can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/ latest/3/0.0/myrr.html
The software package is also available in addition to the standard Windows and Mac OS systems.
On request, either at home or at work, we can take over the installation CD at home or at work.
In order to make home use more efficient, free is probably the biggest attraction, but the Open Office package is now trying to play ball in the business sector, as it can count on a number of network and school projects.
There are no educational, advisory and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises that can open up new business prospects for small and medium-sized enterprises.
The Open Office consists of five basic themes: Writer, the appropriate text editor for Word; Calc, the administrator for the replacement of Excel; Impress, point-like presentations; Dbase is the most recent Access Data Manager similar; and finally, Draw is the graphics module.
The 2008 target is to reach 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that the display of the new version is already at 3,60 million, this figure will be equal to the expected value.
The result is also positive, this is already the fourth doping business.
At the last stage of the Tour de France another positive sample was produced by one of the participants, Austrian Austrians Bernhard Kohl, who competed on the Gerolsteiner team, who won the best mountain trick in addition to my bronchel.
The news is on the Ekype Internet Newspaper, and it's coming out of the world.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer, the Italian Riccardo Ricc√≠ and Leonardo Piepol, as well as German and Gerolsteiner competitor Stefan Schumacher, who considered Cera testen to be the third-generation version of EPO to produce a positive result.
Kohl's blood samples, as in recent tests, have been tested by laboratories in the opinion and chatainey-malabry.
If the control tests also complete the positive round, the third part of the 32rd round, and, in accordance with the specifications, they shall ban the competition for two years.
The positive results of Kohl's third-generation EPO test were also confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and reported to the United Press on the positive doping outcome to the Danish authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has got behind the Spanish Carlos Sast and the American Cadel Evans, and won the best top-notch stick-offs.
INSTALLATIONS: THE NEW YORK'S TERRITORIAL FUEL FOR A REQUEST, THE CALL OF ITALY?
In a foreign country, it has only recently turned into one of the common places of migrant migrants who have been attracted to sedentary emigration.
This is why the "Belpaese" racist nation is changing? This is a question raised by the New York Times, which, based on the case of the young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre, which was murdered in the past month in MI, because he stole a third of the Kinx - a long article about racism in the United States.
It is a good idea of what the New York Times call "the paradox of people": in the northern regions "the strongest is integration and the highest is employment", but "the support of immigrants and the North League" is also the strongest in the country.
In support of the additional tension between the Italians and immigrants, the NYY also refers to cases in USA, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Voltour.
In fact.
The League has also followed new laws that would bring the root closer to immigration and would facilitate the extradition of immigrants in the United States as an example of a climate in the United States.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. He met with Benedicts in the Curinale and raised the state and the United States to work together to promote racism."
Students suffer from expensive rent discounts, but they can cost up to 900 euros a room.
The market for all-university accommodation is not affected by the country.
According to the latest report of the Sonia, Rentals Trade Union, one student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in the United States of America, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now spent an amazing amount of time, which, because of the huge total cost to families, excludes the wide-ranging aspects of students from learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia study office. "In these cities, students have been greatly affected by the market that a general shock process has come to an extent contrary to local residents."
In most cases, properties also contain a number of irregularities: non-registered, non-remunerated contracts, and leased contracts.
In addition, it would be necessary to take all measures that could help to maximise prices by revising the tax system.
It is clear from the details of the surveys that Brianza is also asking for EUR WM for a meal; the price of a single room from 650 last (Bande Neresae) is usually EUR 800 (Lamiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can reach EUR 900 (Vittoria region).
In Florence, a living room costs about EUR 4500 per bed, about EUR 5500 per room.
In Bosnia, where the majority of students live in the area near the university, a living room costs EUR 250/280 if it is double and EUR 3/4 if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central university (San Lorenzo, St. Bologna) about 600 people are asked for a single and lyric bed for a double room.
They are much cheaper (550 Euros a single room) at prices in other parts of the world (Ostense and Cinecitt√†).
You can save everything in the suburbs: 300 euros a bed and 450 euros a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other places.
In both countries, they ask for $1/million for a living room, one for 400 to 600. The auction is the biggest in the area of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Amisi.
In Paris, you will have to pay 250/350 euros for a living room and at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are the same as in absolute terms, but they represent a higher weight within the city's budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students are often looking for one another, another disorder can be seen: the rate applied for from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than in the case of Hungarian tenants.
Good morning, Cinema Paradiso, the cities have been blessed with the time of the old cinemas.
Traditional cinema closes to the benefit of Multiplexes.
"a city where there is no cinema, a blind city, it's like a face with no eyes".
The images taken by the director Giuseppe Tornatore are an effective way of showing what is happening in the large Italian cities, but also in rural areas.
The suppression of cinemas - the appearance of a large multi-room mosaic in the outskirts, and as a result, a number of them in the city centers - is an incredible and irreversible process, but at the same time it shares all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When historical and memoryless places disappear, "it's like a mother goes away, like a woman who has given us a journey and a lot of experiences", says the director of Cinema Paradise. The film, which was the award of 20 years ago, and the grand prize of the Cannes castle, tells the story of a small-town movie lyric, after a movie that was lost forever.
The biggest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, is clear: the last five years have closed 316 international movie theaters. The biggest loss could have been caused by cinemas in the metropolitan areas: 10 cinemas were closed in Florence, 9 second, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 Turin, and 5 Palermo.
Among the most affected regions is Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single cinemas, and then Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And that it is precisely because of their absence that the space penetration of multiplexes is responsible for nothing more than the fact that in these three regions of the United States the number of newest multi-room cinemas is the highest: the number of rooms in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and both in Emilia-Romagna has risen by the last few years.
"The number of Italian units has increased uniquely," says Anec President Paolo Protti. "It is normal that we are building new facilities, but the survival of existing ones should also be safeguarded, because when a city cinema closes down, not all exits are willing to enter the multiplexes.
Not to mention the unused financial funds intended to support importers: the State's debt expired can amount to around EUR 10 million.
In a ethical and moral sense, it is dangerous that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
The market share of the Union is between 18 and 18 %.
Particular attention should be paid to the case of Bologna. This is the first town in Italy, which, in the light of the closures, has decided that an outside and downtown cinema can be used to act and boost, by means of an agreement between Anec and myself, to remedy the problem.
These would include tax subsidies to operators and the possibility of making access available to operators: viewers can enter the border zones and park in some minutes with a reduced tariff.
"I like this initiative" -" said Giuseppe Towere - "and I hope that other cities, as well as other measures, can follow the example of Bologna.
However, it is certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the control of multiplexes, need to improve sound and image quality, because today's world is much better than today's.
The preservation of traditional cinema has always been an important issue: the closure of the Supercinama in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the rock that I have done for Cinema Paradise, although I have been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for twenty-five years, so when I go to Nazionalne before the closed Rialto or Quirale so I don't see your dust-covered posters, I'd rather turn my lady away.
There is a tight line between politics and the 'ndrangheit', and they have taken the lead of Gioia Tauro.
"Gioia Tauro Mayor of the Piromodel Clan supported government decisions".
Serious accusations have been made against the judges of the California Anti-Mafia Directorate-General, Gioia Tauroya and his Under-Secretary General, Giorgio Dal Torrone and Rosario Schiavone, and Rosarno Mayor Carlo Martel, who were arrested this year in criminal proceedings against criminal prosecutions.
Blench has been placed in the hands of Gioacchino Piroform, a senior broker between the clan and the public administration, as well as the same lawyer as the master, who has now been convicted of being in a mafia-like jurisprudence and who has been paid $10 million in damages.
"The lack of any legal and regulatory rule, which is more like it," states the public prosecutors. The two state authorities express their wish to make advocacy to the Piro template lawyer.
"So the clan would have officially had access to the city hall, which would have given it other means of administrative control and control, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, the President of the General Assembly of the Calabria region, does not deny that the United States has "number of co-plays between the local institutions and the organization below": There are areas where mafia is more powerful than elsewhere, where co-playing is almost inevitable.
Local politics, however, resists the pressure of the 'nwright week, they are the heroes who remain knowledge'.
This morning's surprises are the continuations of the events in July, when the police announced that they had managed to stop the Piromodel clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were exempted from their responsibilities for the administration of the government. Gioia Taurounisu Committee was once disbanded in 1991 due to organised crime and suspected links between the local government.
Giorgio Ding Torrione, Governor of the Registrar Christian Democratic Party at the time of the break-up, was placed in the second round of 2006 under the pre-requisite of an exchange coalition.
He called out a scandal when the Church of Megyeh√°za was disbanding the municipal committee.
Mr Marco Mininii, then Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, was brought to justice and accused of planning everything for political purposes. However, the court stated in the order for suspension signed this morning that the Pirom model clan had gone so far as to demand a change to the A3 project.
The hearing against D.T. Torrion, which is written by the public prosecutors, reveals that "there was a need to comply with the responsibilities of a broad group representing the Piroel family known to be close to the Piroel family, and to submit the decisions of the Court to the clan's questions."
Energy is for the power to come, and now it's for the big ones.
It is an amazing energy source that accounts for 70 percent of the world's surface, and what is still being discovered by large global energy companies.
Drainages, sea currents, tides, and a source of energy, which are covered by giants such as Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on it.
For the past year, they have been searching for the opportunity to recover from the sea's movements. In the '00s, during the first oil crisis, research has become more and more violent.
In 1980, when oil prices are reduced, the idea of using energy from the sea has been put aside, but today the rise in demand for environmental protection and oil prices again gives new impetus to the industry.
According to the London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007, 15% of the world's electricity demand could be covered by offshore charging facilities.
This quantity is twice what nuclear power plants currently generate.
In addition, there are also currents and floods.
The giants are on their feet.
Energy was the first company to commit itself to energy in the sea and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was signed.
It has been two years since, and more and more companies are taking advantage of marine energy, including those who have so far been committed to the traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying energy-use technologies in the oceans and considering the possibility of co-operation with us," he said, spokesperson of one of the U.S. Public Prosecutors' Associations, the Wall Street Journal's Economic Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns the authorisation to launch a project in Alaska for the use of marine energy issued by the European Commission.
It is not a matter of little importance, especially if we consider that the United States is currently conducting oil production in the Netherlands, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the Verdant Power Inc. and the Ocean Power of New York are also on the way from the sea. As far as the details are concerned, the investments so far have been made, as far as they are known, they prove to be of no use to me.
It's time to work out what's going on.
As far as possible, it is still a mere technology, which is because the power from the sea does not dispel any of these concerns.
Existing establishments such as those in Portugal or Scotland are all small, and therefore, in the context of the ecosystem, they are not very much a problem.
However, in order to produce more energy at a higher level, we need installations that have a higher environmental impact.
There are different options: for example, the Oceania uses a interconnecting boot system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving up and down the bushes are turned into hydraulic pressure by the pumps and cylinders inside them.
The pressure is spinning a turbine, and it's powering a generator.
Electricity goes to the mainland on sub-sea longways.
At the same time, there are four similar types of facilities in the planning phase that are now just waiting for a federal licence.
However, Verdant Yes has already started power generation for a √≠ and a parking lot with the help of six subsea turbines in the New York East Beach Sea.
In the event of a flood, the flow of water spins the gears of the turbines, and this movement keeps the generator running.
Verde has been told that he has a long list of partners who are only waiting for authorisations to use the data.
A wave of hooves after a flood.
At present, special attention should be paid to the potential to be exploited by the flood.
This is a temporary phenomenon, the current is more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable energy sources.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states spent millions of dollars in 2008, just to exploit the energy provided by the flood, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
