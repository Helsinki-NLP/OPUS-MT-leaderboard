I have to go to my office.
How'd the test go?
Don't go back to that diner.

You had no right to do that.
This is too easy for him to do.
He doesn't like my answer.

We know only one detail of the universe.
Tam√°s is good at chess, too.
He died from lightning electricity.

You want to ask?
Tom told Mary not to ask for too much money from now on.
He's not as elusive as he sounds.

Tomot's promise was made.
Here we are, no.
The change is inevitable.
Tom touched me at the very least.
In fact, generosity is not one of my husband's virtues.
I didn't get it completely.
He went to check on his parents.
I'm sure you do.
He wants me to marry Tom.
I'm a practitioner, and I don't have any muscle.
That's him.
My mind is turned on.
There's nothing to be sorry for.

You need to give me another chance.
Do you have any children's classes?
My house is close to the lobby.
I did.
The population is growing.
He's completely lost.
My grandmother made that decision.
We need to do something about it.
It was strong.
I fell asleep.
I caught him.
Let Tom drive.
A spoon.
All their faces?
The nurse measured my fever.
It's really good for you.
I love the sunlights.
It's obviously very painful.
is this fish?
Go to hell.
You're not late.
- What is this?
Your doctor wants to send him to a specialist.
Guide to us is a guide.
Tom is better than Mary.
She has a lot of tattoos on her body.
Director General at the age of 30.
Who painted these pictures?
Those aces have deteriorated.
I'm making my coffee on the ground.
He says Tomi doesn't want to wait for you.
Do you want to visit the Chichen Itz?
My budget is tight.
I love my mom, too.
I want to do it.
Well done at school.
They're our good friends.
Tom didn't know which one to choose from.
Don't do less than that.
All right, here we go.
Why are these girls so cruel?
I still have to get to work.
The mother was really afraid of freezing the mother.
Don't you want to change your mind?
Thomas is completely exhausted.
This is a big mistake.
We all have the same problem.
Tom is always contradicting himself.
Hurry up!
I am in favour of Tomi.
That's a good idea.
I went to the pool with a car.
If you change your mind, you know where you are.
I don't like chocolate.
We were just having lunch.
It's very important.
There's yoghurt in there the other day.
The argument has no power.
Do you have a lighter?
He didn't drown in the pool.
Watch.
God will help us.
He'll take care of it.
It's really good for you.
Would you mind telling me, please, where did you put the key?
I've got time for this.
Right there.
He's the one who's been taking the lead.
Here.
I have to convince Tom.
I don't think they like me.
The inside is very busy.
That's why I didn't intend to live in a metropolitan area.
Tom's got rabbits.
He always leaves his bike dirty.
I can't just leave.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That day my life changed.
Is that part of the world?
You need to cool down.
You know I don't like eggs.
I've got a car.
Tomi couldn't help Mari.
Does anyone know the name of Tomi's family?
I tried to control the cracking scream.
My wife's family is very rich.
Tell Tomi I'll be back.
Get out of here.
He broke his face.
Tom, open yours.
The boy held a mouse with his tail in his hand.
I want to go there.
Thank you for your wonderful work.
We hope not.
Your French language skills have improved a lot.
Tom won't say a word you say to him.
He got two five on the exam.
Tomi's word stands for Ma's word.
I don't have time to talk right now.
Have you ever been to the rest of the country?
They're making coffee at home.
Respect cannot be sold.
She smiled at me.
I'm afraid so.
You never should have left early.
This book is for use in an hour.
Health is important for the population.
Thank you, Tom.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking to Tom.
I think all fat people should have a diet.
What do you want to do?
I don't know. I'll call him and ask him.
Could you suggest another date?
I gave up early.
What are you doing there?
It's completely normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Some 30 minutes have passed.
All right.
Let's try it.
Tom was touched to pay for dinner.
Buy a piece of cake.
I need a snooze. I need a snooze.
S√°mar S√°muel.
I want to travel alone.
That's not what I want.
There's my guitar in the trunk of the van.
We were sitting there.
It's all over and it's broken.
It's all bad.
That's a good line.
I have a computer.
Tom is not suffocating.
The first tenants left the place in a mess.
Kiss me.
Your theory is very far from the reality.
Some people look at others, just because they have less money.
The witch cursed the girl.
He didn't show much interest in me.
Your job is done.
Now I want to pay for it.
There's something you need to ask me.
I answered the question.
Mary has solved the mystery.
Do you have any of those?
How can I fix Tom?
He just got here.
I'm at home having dinner with my mother.
I shouldn't have done that.
There's nothing I can do to prove.
You can ski on that property.
He was drunk, and Mary took him home by car.
English is not English.
Tom's organization has been a huge success.
It was naked.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Have you seen Tomi when he gets mad?
Tom also seemed surprised.
I often go swimming in the river.
Don't worry about it.
I'm sorry I came to Australia.
They do the same thing I do.
Great.
Away from the ladder.
Mary left for the fitness class.
The report is being prepared, and there was a lot of regular errors in it.
It's not a single day, it's not a single day, it's not a single day.
She's gone off the hook.
Tom is in the criminal record.
He's coming to the village tonight.
She made me feel better.
I have to go out.
I'm looking after the food.
He can't stop it.
I've learned a lot about Tom.
I need a job.
She's still asleep. She's still asleep.
It's a gulp.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf, too.
I'm too busy for my team.
Back off.
I don't know where I am.
Tom didn't do anything.
He's very fond of his love.
Have you ever lived in a remote relationship before?
All the passengers were deported from there.
I need a pen.
He doesn't know what to do with the problem.
Now I'm thirsty.
He's going to work on a bike.
Are you ready to go now?
Don't be so sentimental.
I run three kilometers a day.
I never understood Tomo.
It was a pain in the ass to be there.
Morning breakfast.
Uncontroversially, he is the smartest student in the brain.
You should have called the cops.
They'll keep it a secret.
So far, he hasn't flown a broomstick.
You've poured out the cash flow.
I couldn't have done it myself either.
Three years ago, this club was a member of this club.
In my watch, it's so small that I can't replace it.
Go home.
I'm not crazy.
She found my ma'am.
I figured it would come, Tom.
He loves flowers, he can't be.
In this way, everything is relative.
The old man was a cop.
For adults only.
About as tall as you are.
Tom is honest.
It is important that we help those who are in trouble.
You can't teach old dogs a new trick anymore.
I have to let go of the steam.
I love the okicic language.
You know what you mean.
We have work to do.
He says you love him, he's gonna love him.
Can you lend me the book when you're done with it?
I already told you that.
It would cause disaster at work.
What do you think of my theory?
Give me some time to figure out what's going on.
He's not afraid.
We don't have enough information.
It's a long way from home.
The bus's on the way.
There is the largest lake in Turkey.
The hell's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Either way, you have to wait for the line...
I don't want to be a fugitive.
He looked at his pockets.
That's even more so.
He's doing it with all of them.
Are you ready to log in?
We're about to change now.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
My request was rejected.
We were surprised by the sound of the news.
Do not underestimate yourself.
I'm sorry.
Here.
I have toured the whole of Russia.
I like to upset Toi.
Mys is ours.
He's a stranger.
You don't know the truth.
Tom is also angry with the least-favoured expression.
You are neither, nor this is the truth.
I went without him.
He loves his brother.
Where else would we go?
If you don't like it, you can go.
Tom will pay.
I see.
Tom was just wondering.
I don't want to see him.
Help yourself if you want to eat anything.
She's still in bed.
Do you have to work every Sunday?
We'll split up.
We haven't had a problem so far.
What color is your hair?
In the back where you're sitting, I'm sitting right behind you.
You're not good-looking.
I'm sure Tomi will understand.
Do you believe in spirits?
I think I can trust you.
The noise has woken up.
Co-existence is for the lame.
During one night of the month, the whole town was stuck in the middle of the city.
I'll get it.
Well, let's just say, I don't really care.
The fall is the best trip year.
Did she leave tomorrow?
They called the vet because there was no other doctor in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him swim.
You're on your own.
Monday work?
What's your commission?
The dean got his hands on the college student.
I live in the middle of the night.
Tom could be at any time.
I think that time will solve this problem.
Did your shirt work?
I'm gonna stay home and watch TV.
Christian?
Ask Thomas to explain himself.
You broke it.
Because of the noise, I was by the window that was open to me.
The day is saved.
He went back to his umbrella.
Let's go to the movies.
I want to fight a fight.
A Nazi killed a Jew.
We don't know.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
We're going to learn a little bit about us.
Yes!
Is that all you want?
Do you want to talk to me?
You can't believe a word I say.
I love Spanish.
I'm gonna go take a walk to get my head kicked out.
A job doesn't hurt anyone.
A chain is as strong as its weakest eye.
I'm often looking for you.
I'm going to check in for work today.
I'm about to keep you informed.
Tom said Mary was Canadians.
He traveled to Kosovo in the first place.
I'm sure I'll be happy to have my berber knowledge.
The king's enemies have been challenged by the king.
You're talking.
I want Mary to leave Tomi, let her finish.
I'm out of here.
We have a big problem.
You're too drunk to drive.
Her eyes are red from the crying.
You go there without me.
I'll be able to handle it.
It's not yours.
I was wrong about that.
Take it, please.
We're gonna do this together.
Can you help me, please?
She saw Mary Tom smiling.
Hurry to reach the eight-hour train.
You looked at him like a hero because he saved his own life.
Your father would also be proud of you.
Give me a couple of seconds.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tom's eyesight is sharp.
I'm afraid you're coming at four.
I don't want to lose this game.
The education system is transformed into a new one.
There they are.
Yes!
She ate a bowl of blueberry.
I don't feel like getting up.
Thomas thought Mary had financial problems.
When I hear the news, I'm gonna be in the neighborhood.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Why worry about what happens after we die?
We need to help one another.
Sometimes my dream comes true.
He spent all the money I gave him.
There were times when I was neighbors.
Do you think you should tell Tom?
What's it worth?
Do you know how to do this?
You're a liar.
How old is your tattoo?
I don't have a nickname.
Who loves Tom?
Kill Tomo.
I think I'm dying.
What's in it for?
Tom has a scratch on his forehead.
We're alive.
You're smarter than you think.
Did you take your camera?
Tom did a lot of great things.
I've been busy.
Everything has a limit.
Don't be an idiot.
You're gonna pay for this.
It would be good if we had a collection of the last words of the universal man.
I'm a social worker.
The ceremony was amazing.
I believe your words.
How so?
Tom has as many as he needs.
Tom wants to be a success.
Nothing.
Were you in the library last afternoon?
I like you more than anything else.
He wrote ten books, but he didn't show any of them.
She's home with her family.
I really don't want to eat right now.
Your success is complete.
They didn't hit me.
You could do this for you.
It won't take much time.
I hate cops.
Tom said you hate to dance.
If you have time, why don't you look into his gallery?
I was, but then I gradually calmed down.
I don't want to buy this hot couch.
You have to ask me a question first.
Give it to me.
I am aware of the difficulties.
No, I don't.
Where you from, Karen?
It's frozen in every mountain.
That's the way he went.
Milk poured into his cat's tank.
I think something terrible is going to happen.
Is that it?
I'm...
None of them are there.
I was enemies.
Tom was afraid of Marit.
No matter what, you don't speak French.
I had it.
She's a different opinion than I am.
We can't save everything.
..below.
Where's the moon when it's not in the sky?
This is the best place in town to eat?
I just need to get back to the road.
Tom should have been either one of them.
Without exception, I did not.
It broke the barrier, and it flooded the valley with water.
You look very pale.
Bring him in.
I'll talk to Thomas.
I made a lot of money in the reserve.
I have to tell Tom what to tell Mari.
I didn't eat.
I'll take your terms.
I'm a good cook.
It's dangerous.
Can I get my ass out now?
It's me.
I was sick.
She was born in the first place.
Can you wait a minute?
Spiders have two legs.
I am.
She's looking down on the woman.
It's ugly.
Working as a driver.
He knows me.
That's enough.
We didn't have dinner.
It's all over me.
I will give the message to Tomi.
It was too strange to admit your feelings.
This should have done a lot better.
Did they sing two songs?
Home home.
Already, haven't we?
Mr. Harrison was sitting on the porch of the lugasal zone in his shirt and sucking his night pipe.
Today, I don't want to learn anything about it.
Tom's really messed up.
Go, but without me.
I had no idea I trusted Tomi.
What kind of bean do you have?
That was you.
Trust me.
You're lucky to see a dead star.
Each has diplomatic relations with each other.
My mother is no longer alive.
They're not all alive and they're not all white.
You have no right to judge these people.
Obviously, it's out of hand.
and it's the same value.
We will discuss this.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
The power isn't sounding.
Can you break one hand of an egg?
I've got a twin brother here.
He's here to protect you.
It seemed that Tom was very concerned.
Tom's got blood in his nude.
There's a book on the table.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
When is the next train leaving?
Sometimes I don't understand him.
Any time, you can ask me anything you want.
I love you.
It's not your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't need to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You can go home now.
It's just a threat.
In front of our house there are two old geezers.
They were covered up.
Amphibians fell on a long, blonde hair.
I don't recognize anyone in the picture.
I hope we're not causing a genuine inaccuracy.
Let's talk about this outside.
He's studying his coma.
That's his word.
I don't care about any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't make enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I won't pass the exam tomorrow.
The sentence is fine.
The new furniture arrived today.
Lone.
I've never seen this in my life before.
I'll call Tom right now.
I broke up with my mom.
Hopefully it'll be okay.
It's an hour's worth.
Margarine is a good place for need.
This was popular in the twenties.
He did it all.
Are people like fish in aquarium?
I live in a little house, not anymore.
Tom risked it.
Can I help you?
paragraph what the teacher asked Sarah to read was nothing interesting.
Tomi and Today are good teachers.
He gave me Mari's number.
Rod is lying against John.
Oh, my God, that's so hot.
There's no money for this sale.
Tom would've gone for a walk.
Tell Tom he'll meet us at the station.
A professional diver.
Good to see you.
He was a good worker.
Everyone has the right to be brave, and some of them are back-to-back with this right.
I need some encouragement.
Dani knew Linda had passed away.
I'm not the man I was.
I'm not Catholic.
Let's get some rest here.
We're out of money.
I don't want to walk with you.
I don't understand.
What is the reason for this hat?
I come from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more than that.
He taught me most of what I know in French.
Can I get you something to drink?
He's got his money in him.
I don't care if you're watching me.
What are these?
I want you to take care of yourself.
There is one solution.
What do you think Tom is looking for?
I don't think so.
This is under the control of the wicked forces of the world.
He didn't want to hide his trust.
I'm in line right now.
Can I get a kilo of sprat, please?
Don't worry about it.
The story was real.
The wounded were screaming from the pain, after he was having an antacid.
I need it.
How much money do you have?
Focus.
They don't talk yet.
Come on. Come on.
He always asks for your opinion.
We use margarita instead.
I am fully satisfied with this statement.
When they do the same thing, it's not the same thing anymore.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
How much will he get?
Is it true that Tom committed a murder?
Serbia bordering Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.
You can follow his advice as well.
My name is Ricardo and yours?
He's been talking to you lately.
What matters is that it's happening again.
It's yours, Tom.
Have another drink.
My shoelace got stuck in the walkie-talkie.
Do you like ice cream?
About to speak French.
I'm sleeping.
He doesn't understand.
I'll tell you what.
Tom retired a few years ago.
We're all in the game.
She was lucky.
Don't worry about it.
They made two bottles of wine.
Come on.
Could this be a negotiation?
That's good.
Tom should have won the competition.
I'm the one who has to be registered.
I'm not even there to give up.
I don't want to know either.
Fate is what we don't expect.
What is a prescription?
We're together.
Give me a painkiller, please.
You're crazy.
It really froze, which is why she didn't come to school today.
It's okay. It's okay.
They're going to negotiate.
This table has a smooth surface.
Open it up.
Is that in English?
It was early for you to see the sunrise.
Tom took part in a seminar.
A sense of sarcasm?
I'm a thief. I'm a thief.
You can't always get me out of the sod.
Where is the police?
She was too tired, and she just fell asleep.
I hope that in the near future I will learn your perfect language.
Tom was so paranoid.
I need tools.
All the calculations are made.
Don't talk.
Tom didn't even know how to thank him in French.
Where is the nearest archive?
I was singing.
They're just like you.
Thank you very much.
There are less than three hours left.
Tom's parents were hippies.
This is a mistake.
This one looks like mine.
What a jerk you are.
It may be obvious, but not for me.
Don't try to track me down.
No one knows everything.
He's a police officer.
Don't eat.
But that's not the real problem.
What's the title of the book?
Tom loved me.
Are we for real?
Russia is great.
Who is the woman who stands there?
It was a total bankruptcy.
I mean, he was the most powerful man in the country.
I look forward to getting better.
Is it cold around here?
Get off my camera.
He has to go crazy.
Don't ask me to help you more.
I'm not coming.
Thank you.
Get a pine tree.
It's not drinking water.
Did you do it in person?
She doesn't look too cool, does she?
Please speak up. Please speak up.
You have to keep your eyes open.
Tom has a black cat.
Refuge is born, and trust is born.
In the past, the story of the past has come about.
Mary's got a box of chocolates.
My destiny is in your hands.
Talk about something else.
The lamp went out, and we stayed in the rest.
I'm trying to clean my room.
The horse stopped and refused to move on.
He accused him of giving him credit.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I have decided to join the free fire department.
Tom stood up, but then he sat down again.
I love melons.
I wouldn't go out today.
The woman sitting there is the wife of the wife.
I got the letter.
I feel much better today.
The tank came in.
There's nothing you can do to learn.
Go somewhere, or I'll throw you out.
Everything ready?
We have to go home.
No, they're not.
There is no justification for their existence.
Maths are poets, they just have to prove what their imagination was.
I'm a co-operator.
She was the most afraid of mess.
No one knows what will happen in the future.
Good, honey.
What do you think of real art?
My name's not even my name.
The heat is terrible today.
Gy√∂rgy is the most important man in our alone.
You're sure he's in the pen, aren't you?
It was not built in a single day.
Were you old when you started French?
What's with the money?
We must protect ourselves from any attempt that takes our freedom.
Seventy-five divided by five to twelve.
What are you doing next?
Let's have a donuts.
Tom's intentions were not pure.
Do you have my book?
Just think about it.
Tom did what he wanted to do.
I can see the light.
I'm just as guilty as anyone.
You're worse than me.
Look at me here and there.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not going to hurt you.
He's a salesman.
You can't always win.
A silver coin.
I feel like I can't help myself.
Oh, my God.
I'm fat. I'm fat.
It's ten o'clock in the morning.
There's a road full of cockroaches in there.
What does it say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If it's time, we'll have a picnic.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Who are these rings?
I'm sure this tennis game is for me.
He went back to the village.
One of us is wrong.
I was surprised by what I learned.
The elephant has two ears.
We're boys.
I'll meet him at home.
Would you like me to give you a copy of one of these?
I have to give you a message.
He said he didn't know.
It's better than we thought it would be.
You know my secret.
She's got her tattoo covered.
It's true that I'm making up for this.
He told the guy to line up.
They have 12 children.
My hobby is to read novels.
You'll get used to it.
I don't know why Tomi went to the hospital.
Prices have decreased.
I don't mind waiting.
We'll meet each other.
This happened when he was out there.
He painted the door on the floor.
Just start working.
I'm sure I'm sorry for your loss.
Tom cleaned out Tom's car.
Let's take a look at this.
You are the most important thing in my life.
But the proposed changes conflicted with each other.
I sat this tree myself.
Tom let me go.
Can I know your full name?
Oh, yeah.
He's also a homeboy, and he's saying what he's saying.
That's not true.
Every single one of Mary's chocolates.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your boarding card.
Here you go.
What's your profession?
Tom Mary's boss.
Small, or there's no way they're gonna find real marriages.
They left Tom alone.
Too bad I'm late.
She didn't agree with Mari.
I want to give you a smile on your lips.
Is that a bird?
I've satisfied Tom and Mary.
Is this a wolf?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
It's daytime.
All right, everybody, let's go.
He went on a trip with his wife on a trip.
I knew that Tom and Mari were getting married in the first place.
The white ball is as strong as the axe.
Here you go.
Are you going to leave with a car?
I don't think this chair is comfortable.
Tom's tea was poured into the tea.
Tom was trying to reduce costs.
Tomi told the dog to sit down.
Are you sure that she's never coming back?
You know me.
It's not appropriate to talk with a mouth full of people.
Maybe Tomi needs it.
For me, he's like a man.
She's young.
Right over there.
Today, Dana.
That's it.
I didn't grant you a permit.
The food that comes in the soup, white, not pink.
I always take care of you.
He was going to cover me up.
I go to work every day on a train.
Looks like it.
Now we have to do it for him.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know where I'm from.
They're afraid of Tomi.
I'm sure we'll agree on something.
Then the bear ran to the thong, threw down her bear skin, and touched the magic wand that the witch gave her. In the meantime, the heat turned into a bulwark, made out of moonlight, and the thalisk turned into a lantern, which was pulled by two tadpoles.
Don't make a mistake.
You don't have time for this?
The book will bless your time.
Is he high?
I'll be waiting for Tom.
I knew you weren't going home either.
I'm dying of your mistakes.
Thank you so much.
The police found a body in a hostless car near the park.
Sure, you can do it.
Our solar system is central to the sun.
Is it permanent?
He worked his whole life.
16 kilometers away that day.
Tom can't afford to be a pussy.
Look at you.
I cut my hair off.
I can go to bed.
Cathy stopped flowering.
The number of accidents is increasing from year to year.
Start moving forward.
Like you don't want this to work out for me.
He committed the man murder.
There's gonna be a lot of people.
The next train will be on track 2 and will continue at 4:35 p.m. on Sbuya.
Did you do it?

All I'm saying is, I don't want to go today.
Tom's ready to come home.
It was like a father to me.
You'll regret it.
Help is on the way.
Do you speak French in English?
I can do it.
Keep going.
I hope you don't mind me leaving early.
You're all right.
I'm counting on you to join us.
You woke me up.
I'm looking for my phone.
He woke up.
No one can stop me anymore.
Who did you see?
Here I am.
Tom threw Mary out of the house.
What's offended him when Tomi bought him a couple of drinks of freshener.
All of this is a group with a lot of mountains and almost nothing on the road.
We often eat raw fish.
Put the blue folder on the table.
Two years older, but not as tall as I am.
All this fun is over.
It took me a long time to write this book.
For the night to follow, I will walk the lake.
What do we expect?
I've got a stick in my finger.
They're afraid of fire.
It wasn't the same week as it was.
Don't go anywhere just because that's what they want you to do.
The box is a package.
That's what's gonna happen.
You should have if you hadn't.
I gave Tom a key to my office.
We need an interpreter.
You know the language of the woman.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
Listen up, please.
I'm ready to help you at any time.
He'll figure it out.
The batteries are dead.
I found a good part of it.
Either way, we'll all die first or again.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Have you ever been to school?
Tom said he had a job.
Tomi was not able to conceal her decency.
We're trying to warn you.
I thought that their existence was very obvious, unlike the Esperanto, which is very simple.
You better be careful.
She loves kids.
Today we have laundry.
This is so wrong.
Tomi touched my hand.
Who brought this?
It's full of mussels.
These bananas aren't good enough.
Hide behind the curtain.
But I don't have any.
I think you were right.
Where was the wedding?
Swim in the wind.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
Water is cold.
It was a day of the day.
I feel like I'm serious.
It's a good shelter.
Do you have something?
It's a sabotage.
Last night, it's a big deal.
When are the elections held?
Tom.
Tom walked in.
I was sitting on a chair in Bern at the patent office when I had a thought: if a man is free, then he doesn't feel his own weight.
Speak up so everyone can hear you.
On the railway line, a new system for the operation of the train will be set up.
We believe in God.
They forgot about you.
Where are we today?
Dressed up in uniforms.
We should have had two bottles of wine.
Can I borrow a loan?
I'll find Tim.
Stand up.
She's got a job to do.
Good, good.
It doesn't matter.
You've always been like this.
The sun died under the horizon and darkened.
Which side was that?
It's home.
Tom took a piece of food and put it on his plate.
I'll try again.
You never know what's going to happen.
If everything goes well, he graduated from college in 2001.
The decision is made on a day-to-day basis.
He's never talked to me before.
Dani has three thousand flight hours.
He erased his face with a key.
I don't know what's so funny about this.
I'll have to surprise Tom.
It's me.
I was the only one alive.
He advised him to get off the TV, but he didn't listen to him.
Pack up your clothes.
He's done the rest of it.
Are you even hungry?
My watch is cheaper than yours.
I don't even know what Tomi looked like anymore.
Are you crazy or what?
We appreciate his nature.
I feel like I'm feeling better.
The new engine is the main character of a child's mind.
That's right.
Those who give up Fundamental Freedom for a little transition trust deserve one.
The daughter's life is blaat.
In his eyes, he looked in his eyes.
Why don't you come with us?
Tom.
He's a real witch.
I like math.
You're making a mistake.
Dani used a prison cell to clean her teeth.
But neither is it bad for you.
If I were you, I would ask him.
Do you know this man?
I have to work today.
Who do you think looked like in this room last night?
Tom kept the stolen money to himself.
I had a half-graufruit breakfast.
I don't think he's a god.
Tom doesn't know who to believe, John or Mary.
Ageing does not mean that you are no longer allowed to use your fantasy.
It was yesterday.
If I had money, I'd be traveling around the world.
There is a change of political situation.
You can go first.
Tom got tired of reading and tried to play.
I don't know if Tomi has a car.
Sunday is today.
I should have stayed out of it.
How do you feel about Tom?
I hate that movie.
It was.
I'll tie my shoe.
Take off your gloves?
It's really amazing.
The nearest city lies behind the hills.
What are you reading now?
There are mules and actors who hire security guards to stay away from their overespired fans.
Why don't we go to the movies now?
I know you can do this.
It's not for Tom.
These were his last words.
Tom's sport is baseball.
I've been really bad.
I was the first to be a fraud.
I could have done better if I had more time.
Didn't you mention there was a witness there?
You can go when you have time.
Look forward, please.
Get your ass in this bar.
Africa is the human resource of Africa.
Too bad Tomi's gone.
Did you tell Tom about this?
This will be temporary between us.
Do you have a lighter?
Tom still has his dad buying his dishes.
They're not expensive.
I knew Tom knew something.
It was obvious.
That's the end of the last one.
He's still waiting at the station right now.
Welcome to the U.S.A.
They're always late.
Tom was sitting on the other side of the floor.
Tom was nice, but Mary wasn't.
You're better than you think you are.
I've seen what Tom knows.
If you don't mind, Santa won't come along.
You're too young to buy cigarettes.
It was a mistake kissing Tom.
Tom seems restless.
This wine is even bigger than you are.
Do you take some advice?
Ah, that's what this is about.
Zagreb is the capital of Croatia.
This is inevitable.
He's a voice man, he's a guy.
You two had a meeting with me.
Shit.
Here needs to take better care of yourself.
Why don't you take your sweater off?
Excuse me?
I mean, the soup's too hot.
It's my secret.
The fire burned the fire.
Who's gonna do it?
Tom should have done that sooner.
He's in one place.
I ate that show.
I'll stay if it rains.
A story told us about a boy named Tom Sawyer.
He can get away with it.
You don't even have sex, it's either a thief or a bonnet.
This is cheating.
This moment should never end.
You're going to be placed on parole.
- Can I see your ticket?
Please give him my best treats.
She couldn't open the safe.
That's not true.
Access to staff only.
Tomi has already done everything she can.
Where do I meet you?
It's not right.
As a matter of fact, only the father of the single family had a syllable.
The clear liquid water was very hot.
There's nothing else to do.
We have a solution to that.
The need for a new school to take into account young people's special needs.
Please, please don't do this.
Everything between us, was it a lie?
image.
It's almost there.
Turn it up.
That you're here, Tom.
That's what Tomi says.
Its full strength, like the buffoon, is always a dove.
We need to be a bridesmaid.
He went out without saying anything.
I never said that.
I don't care.
I'm old, too.
I'm good for the food.
I scrubbed out the toilet.
I found Tomi there.
I'm sorry, I'm late because I fell asleep in class for a while.
Henry wants to see you.
Can you eat?
I'm having a coma today.
We're not leaving.
Tom did not try to hide the truth.
I was happy.
Can I give you your name?
All claims are false.
My tail.
Excuse me, but there was a lot of traffic.
Tom should have listened to Mi.
Tom apologized to Mary for the infidelity she caused.
I'll excuse you later.
I noticed that he was wearing a new hat.
Hold on, please.
He went on a bad side of the road.
I need to see it for myself.
Don't leave me alone.
I'd love a little.
There's a lot of flowers in the garden.
It's too loud for him to say anything.
It was a simple choice.
You shouldn't have come this early.
He's always asking your opinion.
- I'm tired of television.
The collective responsibility is a liability.
Churches must learn humility, as they teach.
I know who lives in this house.
Who's going to drive?
I hid behind the barn.
He's been sweeping the sand off his feet for a long time.
I often speak French to Tomi in French.
Do you have a homeboy?
It's okay.
He trusted his nurses.
That's not what I'm attracted to.
Of course you will.
Can you keep your eyes closed for a second and stand on the side of your feet?
Namatsu smiled bitterly at his own stupid hand.
You can do it yourself.
I'm glad Tom managed to change his name.
I know this is weird.
I was sitting on the floor.
He wasn't just yelling at me, but he was yelling at me.
Tom is careless.
I'm sorry, I seem to have lost your umbrella.
This is a public beach.
Go and go eat for Tom.
That's all Tom understands.
It's so weird.
Are you taking any medicine?
That's a boring word.
When I give you instructions, start the machine.
A lot of people believe that there is too much violence in men.
It's my own problem for me.
Worms.
You're like me.
This is quite fun.
Can I play in my room?
Everything is edible, but there is one, which is only once.
Very, very good.
It's not a decision yet.
How much did we fall?
Behave yourself in accordance with your age.
The door is not locked.
It's Tony's book.
The trains were on time.
He warned me carefully.
You know I can do this.
It's not enough.
She looked at her cell phone and noticed that there are now three quarters two.
It was home when it happened.
I'm gonna take a little nap.
I got a nice pilot.
The fee has decided to make the money available for charity purposes.
I couldn't stand it.
His name is Tom and not John.
I'm not going to school today.
I'm going on vacation next month.
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
That's amazing.
Who knows who I am?
Stay alive for a while.
He's just one.
Can I help you, sir?
I do know why women live longer than men do.
I can't stay in this house.
I'll forgive you.
They're all in the woods.
I took my bags up to my room with the bag.
Is the snake alive or dead?
He may be the man I need.
I hate to say that, but Tom and Mary are right.
My pulse is irregular.
It's true.
When we got together, my mother gave me this house.
He never misses hope.
The lightning was in the back of the house.
Every morning, make-up for yourself.
Knock the eggs up.
I want to thank you for everything you understand.
Tom suggested not to do it.
Of course I'm not happy.
Sorry about the last time.
It is time to say goodbye.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.
One more time.
The trees are under police control.
She asked Mary to come in.
It can work with your iPhone.
Maybe that's it.
Remind him to come home early.
Tom had breakfast.
We only have three days of living and water.
You have a good memory.
Are you spitting?
He returned home ten months after being away from home.
It's too late for that.
It's all out there.
Yours are the only ones that should be translated into this website.
What is the current exchange rate?
I'm leaving.
Let's take a little break.
It's a shame, but it's a shame.
You're gonna get tired of the hot tub before and after.
I don't know.
They offered it to me.
It's common.
You don't have to buy when you're in gymnastics.
He was startled by the horrors in this terrible situation.
It doesn't matter what happens.
I don't feel like discussing.
It's too small for the future.
Tom gave everything to Mary.
Go on, go on.
Have a cup.
Muel is now 17.
- A drink?
He blew up the balloon, and now it's like one.
I'll read you a letter.
I don't know if I asked for your opinion.
Opened at a window every single time in the summer.
I'll see you later.
If you live outside, you need it.
My pants have been destroyed.
I want to help him, but I don't know how.
You're rude.
My patience for the court.
She brought a tom-flower to Mari.
This isn't the first time it's happened to me.
Don't fight.
I'm sick.
This could be a long time.
Good, good.
I'll be right back.
I don't know his name.
What's your favorite movie?
A few things.
You put your mind to the grass.
John loves chess.
Holy Mary.
Please fix that.
Where is he?
Tomi has never seen Mari as such before.
You're under oath.
It's the same as the price.
They're armed.
The back-up guy's got his name all over him.
When I was a young man, I would have learned how to do it once in a while.
This is the best price for all.
I need a paper and a pen.
I hate being left-handed.
It's weird.
You want to be a nurse?
Show yourself to others.
It's lunchtime. It's lunchtime.
We are departments.
Are you still here this afternoon?
They were listening to me.
She wore shorts.
Do you have a lover?
My son has become a husband.
Everyone is at risk.
Is it written in a document?
The defense program doesn't matter much.
These are all mine.
Tom was tired.
Can I pay with a MasterCard card?
Who knows about this?
Don't be disrespectful.
Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, you'll find something wonderful.
When do you want to check on him?
I don't think I'll ever get used to Korean food.
Scientists have discovered the entire genetic stock of breadmeal.
I don't know what you heard about him.
He likes fishing.
You're kidding me.
I'll be in a hurry.
The trains stopped because of the strong noises.
Tom goes to work and takes a job.
I'll lock it up.
Tom is very energistic.
none at all.
The world is a great place.
I'll do it again.
I don't have any talent.
They treated me like a child.
The water and the water don't mix.
I'll tell you what to do.
Thomas has some lunar land.
We still wonder how he escaped.
You'd better not have too much.
Tom will always keep his word.
You'll lose.
Please do everything you need to do.
I want to marry a girl like that.
The earth is soaking.
Good work, good work.
I don't give a shit about my back.
Tom always does.
He showed me my picture.
This isn't gonna work.
Don't open it.
- What are you doing tonight?
You've got it now.
Pull up the freezer, every time you come in a little light.
I'll never love you again.
Tom talked.
He's got a lot of mistakes, but I'm more of a lover of God.
What's your number?
Tom would probably be happy.
The lake is surrounded by doves.
Did you count on anything?
Kneeled next to him.
I should have been there at the meeting.
It's beautiful.
We're stuck in traffic.
I'm not.
I'm sure I'll miss the exam tomorrow.
We know this song.
Tom is serious.
I can win if I'm lucky.
This is communication.
Come on, let's talk about flowers.
She cried when she heard the story.
I don't think so.
Don't wait till tomorrow.
Oh, I'm so happy for you.
He's powerful.
Our departure tomorrow depends on the weather.
I'm a mercenary.
We do not have a valid example of this.
Maybe they're making a mistake.
He's not here by any chance.
I think I'm too much of a target.
Let's not talk about that.
I'll stay home tomorrow.
He found a wounded bird.
What's your home number?
That's the part.
Whatever you do, don't tell Tam√°s.
That you're here.
Those shoes are too small for you.
Tam√°s gave the police a description of the matter individually.
There's the van over there.
They didn't find any DNA evidence.
He's in the middle of the day when he's taking a condom.
You know a good dentist?
Don't come in.
You're really ugly.
Tom's not the strength of the second parking lot.
The good times have passed.
The dinner was wonderful.
Just act like you don't like me.
You must be right.
I need a few hours late.
What's going on?
He broke this vase on a free-for-all basis.
Take care of your baby brother while the mother is gone.
I'm here to talk to Tomi.
Why did you do that?
I'm a lot of coffee in the coffee room.
You have been valid for the visa.
I'm serious.
You're different than that.
He loves music.
Tom and Mika had fun.
It's a single dictionary.
It's a real day. It's a real day.
Oh, my God, Mary, are you okay?
I know what you can't eat.
This place smells bad.
I can't believe this anymore.
The time was rapid.
Call Tomi.
There's another way to learn and teach a thing.
You have to put the booze down.
It was Tom, wasn't it?
He was a snowman. He was a snowman.
One hour later, the fever was even higher.
What did he say?
I was on the bus.
I'll give you everything you want, but I'll give you everything you want.
Don't worry about them.
I need money.
There's another one.
I can stand up to everything but temptation.
Close the door in a locked cell.
I need cash.
This is essential.
We're done here.
It's all a little bit fresh.
Here we go.
Thank you for asking that question.
The front door opened.
This is for my own good.
It's a kitchen knife.
How do we know that light is faster than sound?
Tom has translated the letter into French.
I want to win that game.
He lived there for about five years.
Last 30, but still with my mom and dad.
They've been married for two years.
She was desperate about the health problem.
In a year, my son became a stronger woman.
She's beautiful.
I guess I forgot about you at home.
I went to my parents' house and said I wouldn't drink.
Tom said he was bored of Chinese food.
We're very much alike.
That was me.
Oh, my God.
I bought a lot for my car.
I see you've done this before.
Don't lose your temper.
The solution was right in front of me, but I didn't notice.
Once, once down.
Very good.
Haven't we met somewhere else?
Tell me a little bit about this morning in French.
Tomi is the best customer on our team.
This is seriously bad.
We can't wait any longer.
Is it far away?
We disapprove of his love.
Of course, Tom loves the child.
I can't stand the fact.
In this regard, I cannot agree with you.
I'm sure she'll take care of Mary now, Tomi.
Tom can't handle things.
Mary's toast was so delicious that Tom bought it twice.
Christian Arabs too.
I told you you'd like it, Tomi.
I'll be fine every day.
This is a danger.
If it's too much work, it's a problem, but it's a lot of time off.
He's gonna stop.
One of the most beautiful sleighs floating on the lake.
It was really quick.
I assured Tom that I would do that.
Of course, of course.
Can I borrow thirty-eight?
I don't understand.
That's good.
I was dating Rome.
Is it coming?
What did he grow up in?
I don't give a shit.
I have the feeling that this site is a romantic novel, which is Tomi and Mari.
I have to follow him.
I bought my house two years ago.
Take it and put it on fire.
I'll tell you what.
Can I kiss you?
The wrong time has kept them from sailing.
I'll take meat and butter.
He and Elke are not brothers.
I like the snow.
You don't vote unless you're 18 or older.
Have a good time.
I used to not eat meat.
Is that the book?
We insist that this project be implemented immediately.
He's a capable singer.
Do you know where Toledo is in Spain?
We're going to work next year.
These keys aren't my keys.
You are the greatest love of my life.
Do you really think I can help you?
What if we do it?
Do you read the Bible?
Tam√°s is holding a data break.
I can assure you that you will never make this mistake again.
May 5th is her birthday.
You really need to keep your jealousy on a leash!
A meal shouldn't look like that.
He collects the meteors.
My knee was holding the car.
Do you want to do it?
Is there nothing you can do to stop him?
Do you have to stop at the store at any time?
First of all, don't let me write to you.
I've come up with the look on my face.
Whatever happens, you just smile.
I was late for the job because of the traffic jam.
Don't you sit down?
She's safe.
Look at this.
I could use your help.
I'm sorry.
Knock your mouth off.
They need you.
He closed the door before Mary.
How long do I have to take this?

In my opinion, Esperanto is very difficult.
This is the water intake.
Close that door.
I don't wear uniforms.
That doesn't matter to me anymore.
Tom's alive.
My hand touched his back and pulled out a deck card.
Am I right?
And they went to a fancy restaurant to celebrate their anniversary.
Maybe Tam√°s is working a long time.
Turn on the air conditioner.
What's your mother's name?
One day he lives on the other, he doesn't have a pen to save.
What's up with you?
She died of diabetes due to diabetes.
Tom, where are we?
I don't know how to roll down the main glass tip.
Oh, thank you.
The least I can do with this idea is the least of all.
Where do you live now?
He was severely offended by me.
Please don't lie to me.
It's Tomic.
Here if you want.
At that time, he was not so obese.
Do you have enough blankets?
The boxer's Olympic champion buys a very expensive jacket. He goes to the Olympic village, he puts his jacket in the wardrobe, and he writes next to it: If you take my jacket, I will kill you.

Tom is a great actor.
Hey, guys.
The situation has improved.
Knee to my knee.
It's working.
Please change the intervention.
Now, look at me.
I should have told you I'm busy.
Why do you want to join the escape, Tam√°s?
The new one's good.
The coffee shop is downstairs, two times down.
On a farm.
I have one.
No one is going to die.
Sunday's the last day of the week.
Thank you for your congratulations.
Just for Tomi.
I'm back early.

She's not the only one.
Kyoto was the former capital of Kyoto Japan.
Tomi is very nice to me, but Samek has a lot more money.
Too much to drink.
The party's already going on.
Tomi pretended to know nothing about this.
Neither is it inevitable.
He must have pressed the button and waited.
I don't know why he didn't do that at the moment.
There's too much heat.
The new one took more responsibility than the new one.
Why are you so ugly?
My wife could cook any one of them.
Write down his address.
I mean, it's totally neutral.
What's the end of this?
You've met my mom, haven't you?
She's got a divorce.
To be a musical will.
Tom was young and powerful.
Here you go.
He still loves me, and I think I still love him.
Thomas had a dream last night.
I didn't think about it.
I fixed the car.
My arm hurts.
What do you have for me?
Her fear was completely baseless.
The world is the world.
It's a kind of energy.
The worst part came in.
Construction has been started as soon as possible.
This world is threatening its prosperity.
The propaganda is the kind of communication you want to convince me about.
I haven't tried.
We'll meet you where you want to meet.
Mary is such a sweet girl that everyone loves her.
Was there anything wrong with that?
I'm sick of everything.
The barter's turned it into a dead end.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
She's not a virgin anymore.
Your hair's starting to freak me out.
At me.
The court has declared the defendant's innocence.
We're not going to win.
Very intelligent.
The forecaster did not come in at all.
I'm in the basement.

After my first gym workout, everything seemed to me like I was disabled.

Who's getting married?
Who is it?
I lost my umbrella.
I speak Esperanto as if it were my native language.
one on the table.
Is it true that you like snack coffee?
Sorry about that.
Go ahead.
I was improvising.
Help me, and God will help me.
There are other reasons.
They're selling.
You're good at lying, aren't you?
This pencil is not gray.
I'm going home now.
I was born on a boat.
The text is not your color.
Special expenses.
They're not jealous.
In our knowledge of the language, it is, according to our knowledge, a human concept.
They have the right to innovate another language.
You can go home now if you like.

It sounds like a sin.
Blue eyes.
Is there a Youtube channel?
Where's the problem?
You can go wherever you want.
Magdalena, my adult daughter is like an angel.
I don't think things are different.
Tom will never know what happened.
I refuse Tomi.
For you.
I should have done this somewhere else.

What was that?
Friend of mine.
Do you feel good about yourself?

Is it today?
Sorry, but I can't hear you.
I need you.
I'm going to tell you again now.
On one side.
I'll get some more.

It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
Think hard.
The other one came close by.
The flight was delayed by more than two hours.
Where do you live in the country?

Where are you going, Karen?
Are you saying this is my fault?
Tom should have done that this time.

In the meantime, that ugly cow is on a diet.
It's shit.
I want you to run to the store and get me.
He drank all of them. He drank all of them.
Good-bye.

That day is a pain in the ass.
They're coming.

Sit down, Tomi.
We're here to eat.
That's what a brain can think of.

He was the last person I expected to see while I was away.
That's what we agreed on.
I think it's time to take a break.
It's not a good idea.
The two of you are in the room.
I'm going to take a shower.
It's been a long day.

We had discussions with the company.
Whatever happens, the letter will be delivered.
Wow, my friend, that's fucking awesome.

Of course, you could have handled the problem better.
I'll never forget what you mean.

Tom was constantly watching his clock.
I don't like houses like this type of house.
It was the last time.
Are you going home?
Be cool before you go.
I want to be safe.

I'm not.
I'm sure you'll make a choice.

Which one is yours?
The game is likely to be cancelled.
Tom locked the door on his ass.

You've got your home.
Perhaps I could learn in blue.
I want to go on a trip.
I'll give you the garden.

I have to meet Tomi.
This is for your protection.
What's wrong with that?
They had strong emotions.
I want to have a cup of soup.

I'm just really glad I can help you with your job.
Why are you here?
They all look the same to me.
But we have three today.

Never leave anywhere.

Fix the mistakes if you find them.
Tom was told whether or not to do it or not.
I don't blame anyone but myself.
There's water.
Come in.
I didn't know about the noise.
She was rude.
He's not really the father.
Today will never find us.
I'll do anything for it.
We saw the kid getting on the bus.
It's not that bad.
He had aspirations.

What's that under your nose?
Which one do you think is yours?
Ar has done a great deal of damage to the environment.
Is there a life ahead of me?
She's working.
I think Tomi's agitating.
On one occasion, Tom ate food and fed food in a natural state, so now he's very careful that he eats food.
I do early school.
We're about to be inebriated.
I'm soaked in my nose.
As you could see, he ran away.
I can't lie.
Would you like to try it on?
Tom cried out.
I have to fix this.
Do you travel a lot?
There's someone here.
What do you mean, in the devil's name, how do you like it?
What does this have to do with my future?
Are you Japanese?
I wore my best dress.
Were you able to pack all the clothes in the bag?

I don't know how much it costs.
Each ship needs one boat.
I'm starting to get high.
Don't use any more peppers.
I'm a cocaine dealer.
It's me, Tom.
You're the reason I'm here today.
They didn't find anything.
Give me your guns.
I want to live in knowledge.
What are you going to do about the side of the cup?
He's like me.
Statistics show that our standard of living is low.
I'm a cape.
Hope exists.
Maybe he's not aware of the danger.
I was young and stupid.
You look very handsome today.
I would be more productive if I didn't waste my time on the Internet.
Women are also women.
You're all dressed up.
Do you like to watch me?
Here we go.
Earthquakes in Germany?
You're helping me.
There's no escape.
Get on the bus.
I'm not worth it.
You don't understand.
It was.
The handle's gone.
I'm telling you right now, I'm not gonna like you.
This one is smaller.
I opened the driveway, and I got out.
Tom's alone at home.
You can do it now. We can do it now.
Tom encouraged Mary to stop smoking.
We all speak French.
I'm going to have some time to read.
Be serious.
Good, good, good, good, good.
In fact, gorillas have the same way as humans do.
I need to go out to the public bodega to get a snack.
Which way is west?
Tom knocked out his opponent.
Stay here for a while.
I know what the next question is.
I'll make sure to go there.
Remember, you have to eat your teeth.
I have no doubt about that.
How did you get there?
That's my shirt.
I had to make it up to him.
Did he come to see you?
- Would you like some more coffee?
It's still playing.
She's as old as I am.
When did you meet Tom?
That's what it is.
Tomi never knew that.
This is an old joke.
This would not be brave, it would be foolish.
Now I've learned a new word.
Why doesn't he want to go home?
Please, give me the ball.
We don't have time for this anymore.
His father-in-law is sick.
Are you okay with what you're doing?
I usually go home at four.
He's got another one.
I think you know what the name of Thomas's girlfriend is.
The actress ripped her contract apart.
By way of re-schedule into a new state unit.
The morning he dragged his forehead.
Let's get to work.
Here you go.
I found this in the books.
When I get to your point of view, I'll ask you a question.
On 16th May, Turkey was second-time Russia.
The air was cool when I came home.
The story was fun.
You don't talk much.
Fuck him.
I don't have any food.
Please, give me my walking stick.
I wanted to.
He was drunk.
Put it in the drawer.
That's a difficult mathematical problem.
I hope it works.
Are you crazy?
Why didn't you talk to him?
Things have changed.
Tom was given to his parents in weeding.
We're going to tomorrow.

The doctor gave it away.
He has never been a picnic before.
I don't want to.
Environmental disaster.
No matter where you're going, wherever you go, you'll see windmills everywhere.
I don't speak liquid French like Tom.
He cut a picture out of the book.
It was two days ago.
I lost my pen.
I'm just trying to get Tom's attention.
Did you get along well?
You have to choose between being honest and living.
I understand that you did not understand.
Tom never told that to the authorities.
Will you give me your car?
You've got to put it in your bag.
I don't see much of it.
Tom didn't have to do that anymore.
Is it going to be two?
This puzzle is 500 miles wide.
He's actually a trucker's cop.
Every time he plays tennis, he plays tennis.
This coffee is bitter.
I'm in a special situation today.
Tom's intentions were obvious.
Are you going to turn off the car yet?
Do you have Tom's address?
Would you have had it, would you have told me, would you have?
It's the night of the night.
I'm on my own.
His speech makes me nervous.
That's Tom's decision.
She's always smiling.
There's an apple on it.
I'm against going there alone.
Cats don't like to be wet.
A bicycle ride to school.
