A 28-year-old hut from a shopping mall in San Francisco, where he was found dead.
In San Francisco, 28-year-olds moved to San Francisco to find a dead local shopping center in the stairs.
However, the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and he says, "Whoever things were going well with him."
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfrancisable Frank Gali, the San Francisco Bureau of Investigations.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the definition was defined as a spiritual crime and that the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told KGO of the ABC channel in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a liner in Boston, had obtained his job at the Sanfranciscolainen Sons & Daughters restaurant in the bus station six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were "horrorous and upset" for his sake.
"We have a lot of work to do, and we're going to see him very much," said the representative.
We offer our thoughts and our condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Louis Gali said that the police started at the hostel, but that it was not too late to say "who's the truth?
"He found a flat and met a girl," Louis Galicia told the KGO.
Louis Galicia said that you don't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his older brother.
He was benevolent, and he was great.
How to feel about your family was to make home, make dinner," Louis Gali said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who ran the river with him.
"In the world where so much is wrong, he was a grinding diamond that created every day more often," he said.
Those who have knowledge of this matter are asked to refer the San Francisco Police Department to the tip line 415-57.
Operators are in a position: Requirements for new work-related measures.
Officials have asked their trade union to adopt the new work-related measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the Council to support the Council as a whole in supporting new work activities from the beginning of September.
It is said that the ministers have failed to take care of the agreement.
Engineers and home students voted in favour of the agreement that had been concluded with BMA in July.
58% of the votes cast voted against it.
In several letters to the members of the JPC, Mr Ellen McCourt, on Thursday evening, said that there was a "consistently quiet" in the matter of which he was responsible for rejecting the agreement.
He said: 'In this context, the government of the JDC has voted in favour of the full new agreement and is calling for renegotiation of all of your negotiations.'
In response to the government's silence, the government of the JDC has asked for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to authorise the early beginning of tomorrow's work programme to take place and to innovate.
The dispute has resulted in the participation of medical professionals in six cases this year, including one of the most complete work stops in the NHI health care system's world.
The president of BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after rejecting the opinion, on the terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
He had told members of BMA at meetings before the vote of 54 000 doctors and students that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, Prime Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would be decided upon for doctors.
Rural and Turkey: a gathering of the two?
The ele that ended in the crisis.
The Presidents of the First and First Presidents met on Tuesday to shake each other and declare that the fight for eight months and sanctions were obviously over.
With the welcome of Vladimir Putin, a Turkish colleague in the hall of St. Peter's Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara would like more of this to be played.
Yes, there was a talk on the occasion.
The change in Putin seemed suspicious, and he hardly threatened to do so, even according to his own fixed standards.
Now, I'm telling you, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoga's talking about his dear friend Putin again and again.
I lost my mind in the bills.
He also swore that relations with the Union would return not only to the pre-accession level, but to the even better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's actions, as if nothing bad was ever going to happen.
In my opinion, his zeal represented the opposite.
But in Putin, it was clear that there was nothing to blame.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: when Turkey shot down a warplane at the border of Syria.
Moscow's reaction at that time was angry.
I went after Ankara because she stabbed Moses in the back.
The damage was even worse when it came from a real friend.
The real reconstruction of the process will be real, preventative, and prevent.
The public opinion has also been changed since the debate.
For a period of months, the state of the world media has been an amazing, profound attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of high officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from trade from Syria's jurisdiction.
He has strongly denied this.
In the meantime, the complete message was that it was time to move on.
At the end of the day, this meeting only happened because Putin received the required apology from President Erdogan.
Revolution has won some kind of victory.
The ways in which Ankara's settlement is settled are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the best friends he can ever have after he was paralysed in the last month's failed coup.
The constant terrorist attacks in the field are also a clear impression of him.
In addition, there is a pattern of economic activity.
The Russian economic sanctions have been severe, in particular the ban on charter flights, which in general support many humid tourists to the coast of Turkey every year.
The figure has fallen by about 90 per cent.
In this context, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be made easier when they are present.
They wish for a late season attack on the Mediterranean Sea.
And already this time, the state television has predicted lower prices and lower prices of vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
"Courts in the country, tomatoes back here", as stated in the Vedemosti newspaper report.
It also had a valuable added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West about what is considered a weak response to the alleged coup d'état.
As long as it takes to take a long time for the advanced EU migration negotiations to take place, Putin stands out, who is eager to make use of the cool and to break important ties with the countries of the West.
The president certainly got points from Ankara where he asked for support after the revolution.
Of course, this is the understanding of Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of change of power.
This meeting at the prurable sea level opened up the "non-neighbouring group" presented by Mr.Poo and Mr.Joe, as one analyst pictured me: two countries that have abandoned us in the West and are wrongly targeting us, one power in another.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key issue is Syria, where Moscow has recently coordinated itself with the role of the peacemaker, but where Europe and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a good thing that, after almost three hours of initial discussions, the presidents told the press that they were not even in touch with the matter.
The President deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear understanding of where they can find a common basis for Syria.
After months of serious hostility, and taking into account all of the things I did for a NATO member to shoot down a fighting plane, it is certainly better that the two sides are still talking.
The Group of Scotland will disappear from a non-Scotland third party.
According to the Governor of the Bank, the RBS brand is placed in the back office role.
The Group of Scotland disappears from a third party outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBB brand joined the bank's international partners.
After nearly eight years ago, and it had to be saved, the game has abandoned these goals.
The bank has been using the 'RBS' brand to protect other consumer finance portfolios.
It is supported by the main pounds of Six Nations rugby for the sponsorship of international sport, the Wimbledon Master Andy Muragy.
It is now considered right to allow national brands to come forward.
The Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not start again.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchanges, shall be converted into NatWest.
Ulster Bank brand is already in use at Irish and Northern Ireland companies.
There are other, smaller private business brands that can gain more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on behalf of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will be our investor brand and our employees, as we now have a lot more brands to offer."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I'm saying that we no longer have global goals, we have local targets.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it does not continue the Six Nations sponsorship, and it has produced a different brand profile in the field of sport sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move towards a brand bank, because basically (we have been asking questions) it is about how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for the customer", President-in-Office.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a fake customer and offered these brands.
But the work we've been doing focused on customer needs, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor works with Predilesion in Newmarket and wins 30th.
The branch will spray the champagne after the total of 3000 wins after the final victory.
The Slayer Frankie Dettor confirmed its 3000th automatic profit in Newmarket again.
He reached a milestone in one of his home tracks while he was running John Gosden by coaching Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to play in the rivalry of this milestone.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carston.
The third time, the title Dettor, who won earlier at Ghayyyaar, said: "This is a special one."
I'm very specific when my family is here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because I started with 30 years ago.
It's not a big deal, it's not the Royal Ascot, it's the usual night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The Tector sucks up cheers when he talks to the Predilesion after the victory.
The rival has reached this milestone in the battles of Master George Richard Johnson and the surviving 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record of more than 43,000 profits in his career.
Lester Piggot, a ten-time Derby winner, 44-98 wins.
Frankie is one of the day-to-day racers of today, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
He's smart and strong, but he's got a tug on his ass killing him in a weighing room.
He's been in competition, he's got his enthusiasm and his fags on some of the species for some time now.
And then I told him in Epsomi that he would have managed with the 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a football game and a big race!
Seriously, Frankie has been riding with winners in the United Kingdom for most of the 30 years, which is wonderful to see.
He is a living person who is a good thing for British competition, but at the same time he is an incredible jockey.
The Frankie Dettor reported on a large-scale landing from the fairy tale made up of a trade mark.
For two decades, Frankie Dettori has been the dates of the British rivalry for two years.
This has been a mountain track.
By a section of profits in large competitions, including his famous 'Magnific Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the accident and the anti-terrorist race.
Three years ago he was at the beginning when he returned after a six-month ban on competition, but he showed great strength in helping the doubters and when he returned in good condition.
And he may continue to do so - the Dettor has previously said that he wants to continue to compete until at least 50 years later.
Former Head of Staff Serrei Ivanovin
President of Russia Vladimir Putin is suddenly a disfellowshiping Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of the trusted inner circles of Pu for many years.
The 63-year-old is now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport sector.
The opinion of the Kremli stated that Putin "has decided to move Ivanov away from the role of Presidential Administration," but was not given any reason for this.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed his successor.
Only 44, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Embassy of Tokyo.
Later he chaired the president's protocol and staff, known as the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Puti, "Thank you for your trust."
The main task of my administration is to support your work as Head of State, as regards the draft laws and the management of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the old TV station that Ivanov had been asked to let go of the present and recommended that Hoo be appointed to his place.
What are you convinced about?
This is the movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, has been a Soviet security service in KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the two of them said that the Chief of Staff had withdrawn from his office.
But despite the sound of the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, especially first in the parliamentary election.
So this is just some sort of power struggle?
We don't know yet.
Of course, the argument is that the man who was once advertised as a potential candidate for president, each one of them being adversary of the environment policy, has been taken seriously suspiciously.
In his comments on the Kremlin website, Putinille Ivanov said: "It is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me for four years' responsibility for this very complex, I might even say, work, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for six years and eight months."
Ivanov adopted his mission in December 2011.
He formerly served as the Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Security Council and a former member of the State Civil Service KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the FSB, who replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy director.
The municipality came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the four people he trusted.
Once thought Ivano would be next after the second month of Puti, for Puti's third was against the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another close associate of Putin, Dmitri Medvede.
It became the first time before he returned to power only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was shot by the author.
Gibson was involved last month in an inaugural dispute at one of the two locations in Los Angeles.
The producers of series, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his separation in a joint opinion.
Agent Aaron Hotchner's situation, Gibson apologized on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes at the site.
I regret that it happened," he said in his opinion.
According to the opinion of ABC Times and CBS Television Times, the details of how Gibson's character is removed from a series of FBI agents' supervisors are to be found in the future.
The 54-year-old who had previously been in the program with the Dharma & Greg situation since its second period of 2005 has been in the process since.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I have had for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a recent opinion.
I was hoping to be finished, but it's not now.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our incredible team and, above all, the best fans you can have.
The beginning of the 12th semester is scheduled for September 28th.
Mysterious fish ended up in a garden in Banff.
A man in Banff is a help to identify the fish that have evolved into his universe.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be winds left behind by the water cycle.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, was working on a video of the story in Periscope, hoping that someone could bring clarity to the impact of two inches of fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now extends to Fife.
The 1.35 billion-pound project is now expected to be completed by May 2017 at the latest.
Engineers have connected Queensferry to the north of the crossing point and to the land bridge, which means that the bridge is now extending to Fife.
It is the first of the four brackets between the "twilights" that are now preparing for each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The share of bridge Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 washbasins.
The 1.35 billion-pound project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Prime Minister Keith Brown visited the work site today and was the first one from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment for the construction of Queensferry's transit site.
We will all repeat the very active engineering work in this project, where there are more than 40,000 tonnes of concrete and steel alone for the construction of this section of steel."
The enormous size and pressure of the bridge to close the bridge between the land bridge and bridge is a demanding procedure in which the most accurate dimensions must be compatible.
Overall, almost 79% of the bridge is now in place, and the last part of the deck of concrete is lying today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Construction, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always an important milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the construction technology of the top.
When the last part of the road was open and combined with an expanding northern barrier, we had to close the remaining part of the north, i.e. the north, to the west, to the north.
This was done by pulling northward land bridge 700 m southwards.
This was a major and, at the same time, very demanding.
Powerful, the ground bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and was supposed to be pulled around 3% in the slope.
Good, because the tolerances according to which the work was done were small, only a few millimetres in each direction.
But everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: The three men are "happily alive".
Men are "happily alive" after they landed on their fishing boat at Anglesey's place.
The Moelfre HOLI rescue boat station alarmed at 13.20 (BST) the day after the crew saw the event in the developing Moelfre Bay.
The three of them were willing to swim in the safe as their boat moved forward.
"We saw the boat a little closer to the men and imagined the worst," said Runaway Vince Collins of Moelfre's lifeboat.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them before we went home," added.
Local fishing boat for two men, and the second, 60-year-old man was missing an exhausted hanging from a boy without a life vest.
The men were boarded in a rescue boat and brought back to the rescue ship.
He said: "These three men who are caught in water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had a catch-up distance, but it had somehow gone off the boat from time to time when it fell.
Take care of these guys today.
Poméon Go is a petal of health and happiness hunting.
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many people have been concerned that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they are most likely to spend their free time watching the screens.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and take part in some of the activities.
The time for the job was limited to the beginning of the television, then video games, and now to the recent mobile phones.
So it is a great idea to see that technology and external air activity do not go away.
I am referring, of course, to the wildness called Pokémon Go. Application, based on characters that were originally developed in video games in the 1990s (later to a series of drawings, games and other futures).
As many pop-cultures, its popularity was somewhat diluted before the publication of this new game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
After that, the publication of the game in other countries was blocked, since the most popular oversufficient schools were oversufficient.
In the daytime, Pokémon Gol had more users than Tunder had, and almost as much as it knew.
So it'll work?
When explained in a flash-screen, players use their cell phones to look for Pokémons, which are traced by GPS, and which, after finding them, can be "photo" or "chapter".
The generation that played the game in the worse has joined the wild and jumped up the couch to search.
The game is a significant increase in the "interviewer" in daily talks.
Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which followed 35,000 users, told Washington Post that within two days of the game's publication, 30 minutes of the total number of people alive jumped from 45% to 53% of the users following Cardiogram.
Who knows who's playing Pokémon Gota, it only sees the training level.
Many of the public health warnings "find 30", "rise on the couch" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most of the public health warnings are boring and they matter to people who seem to be quiet.
However, the importance of physical activity cannot be minimized.
In order to be able to move safely, there is a higher risk of becoming ill with medicine or depression.
Intensiveness helps to control weight, high blood pressure and diabetes, and its benefits are too diverse to be listed here.
The subtlety of Poméon Go is that it makes people go out and do something that they enjoy.
This will cover three pillars: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
People even get a new home from the woods.
As a matter of fact, it's common to find out what they're complaining about.
Yes, someone can walk right through the door.
So what?
There's a break-in.
In the past, there were applications like Fitbit, which could be followed by activity, which did not give rise to any kind of action in the same way as this game.
The novelty disappears and the use of the novelty will go away in time.
However, because of the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and the activity of virtual reality in the real world, helping many hunters to be more powerful, better and better healthy.

Simone Bales caught a lot of women's gymnastics in a multitude of women's gymnastics.
Pressures.
It's a cover-up.
Simone Biles is a vaccine to all of this.
Energistic jumps.
It's good on the pole.
Unbelievably persuasional.
All over the place.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast reached the multi-mix championship on Thursday, leaving a gap between himself and the world in the Olympic light.
His overall score, 62.198, is clearly better than that of the silver medalist and the "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the same bronze player, Aly Raisman.
Simone Biles in a balanced position in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the United States of America in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) of the United States of America at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de USA on Thursday, 2016 in Rio de USA.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has repeatedly won the multi-stakeholder championship, and all in all, the fourth world.
Your mouth was sore when he was announced at his finale, and his long journey to this point ended.
This achievement brings him to the same level as the best athletes in his country, such as Michael Pxs, who have increased their size to a new level:
Bales has ruled for the last three years to win the 15 World Championships, including 10 people, with programmes whose mixture of mind and accuracy has been so amazing that the year 19th Olympic Mary Lou Retton called him "the best of all, to be sure, the gymnastics".
The final test waited in the meantime, a law that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of the great expectations.
Return to home in Spring without a handful of megalomaniacs would have been disappointing.
Simone Biles, at the left, and Aly Raisma, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) for women in the many individual finals of the television competition in 2016 at the Summer Olympics in Beijing Rio de Mexico on Thursday, live.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he was a top player at the start of a lively team coordinator, Martha Karolyin.
Even though Biles claimed that he was never the future of the future going on long distances to the top of knowledge, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permamatian programme - the one that includes his trade mark's Oltthievation - has been agreed on a Latin American music that would be well placed on the street next to the Olympic Ocean of Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a taper, whose coach, Aimee Boorman's mother, when she was on her way to work in the hall where Boorman was trained, has become a forcemaker.
has not disappeared in many ways since June 2013, and this is a pipe as long as Biles wants.
The cardinal was slightly in line after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The balance and the perma of which Bales is the ruling world were looking forward to it.
He got to the top of the pole at points 15.433 and overcame them by getting 15.ï4 per square.
Raisman hugs him in good will when they waited for the final points - just the tone - and the tears came back to the eyes of Bales glittered, covered and in a certain way, when the dream of which he once wrote his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of tear from four years ago when he was divided in the second place, but lost the bronze to the Proper in the second place.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the kids call "mother," was clearly in charge.
He used flight genders for the general public after permanufacturation at the risk of feeling the return, which sometimes seemed to be an excuse.
As far as Party is concerned, this widespread 18-year-old tweeting this week will make a whole new point:
It was said: Three people were shot at in a suicide killing while they were listening to music in a car.
Two women and a 12-year-old, who died in the most deadly attack of the murder case in the last decade, were sitting in a car talking and listening to the music when they were shot. This was reported in a report published on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rohelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elise Truth Maleah were shot in a car parked on 12th of June.
It is reported that the passenger-party shooter fired his hand up to eight times and fled after that on another vehicle.
According to the police, the third death does not appear to be the result of the incursion, since the stalker did not take the handbags or the other one on the plane.
A representative of the Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting made the investigators look at whether it had anything to do with a few attacks.
All seven people have died and two have been injured in the nine attacks during the four-month period, which have occurred mainly in the Latin American part of the city.
"These are the people who live in the neighborhood in front of the home," Howard said the latest this month for CBS's party to KPHO.
A number of vehicles have been suspected of being used, such as in the late 1990s, in the brown Nissania, in the late 1990s, in the black BMW, in the late 1990s, and in the writing Cadilla or Lincoln.
The investigators have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and that they are the same as the killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for his injuries, where he died later.
Liner, 31, as well as Elli's truth, Maleah, died at the scene of the incident.
The seer told the kid that they were sitting in the car, probably in the parking lot, listening to music.
The authorities also told me about the shooting of the police report, which was only half the time before the triple death, which was an empty open van, and it is believed that this is also the work of a serial killer.
Scientists discovered bullet shells, bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine space.
Mother of a six-year-old with a microbe: "The report is getting easier".
Edmund Picciu, most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys, and now their mothers.
However, unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-minded, and this is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciu, is not known to be known to exist.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Of course I did, he said.
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund would never know who they were, and that he would not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the facility.
"The reaction was that 'I still don't know about it', Picciutu explained.
Edmund walks with the help of a chat room.
Edmund did not sit or crawl than when he was three years old, and he still does not talk.
He's perfect for a little bit of pamphlets.
He's helped and he's riding a bicycle.
He's still having fun with two of his men and a song.
Elizabeth will show you how the last thing Edmund finds is "Sing to me".
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
This is not a common sign language, but it says that Edmund has invented some of his own clues.
It can be due to a number of different causes: genetics, as in the case of Edmund, or infections during pregnancy, such as mumps or Zika virus.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picicív remembers the burden of the religion of the unknown world.
I was just wondering what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
He still does not know.
In fact, I haven't actually asked for a prophecy in a while, because I don't expect anyone to be able to really give that to me.
But there's hopeful advice at the Picciuto for mothers whose babies have a birth defect due to Zika.
It's gonna be okay.
You can believe this is gonna get better.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The heavy rains and floods are the way to rescue operations in Mississippi, Los Angeles.
Rough rain and widespread floods in Louisiana were the governor of the U.S. on the other side of the state, waiting for more rain in the state on Saturday.
National Weather Service reports that a number of species in South-East Asia as well as the Southern Mississippi are flooding over their heads and creating a large flood due to extremely severe rainfalls.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are once again in contact with the local authorities and that assistance is already coming to the necessary districts.
Mike Steele, representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Emergency Bureau, said that they would receive a call from the vehicles, boats and sandbags for the influx of water.
Steele said that the Tangi Devil County alone requested tens of thousands of sand bags.
At the very least, the sentinel is in force in the vast majority of southern Louisiana.
In the opinion, the regular service said that the area still needs three to five cents more rainfall.
In the north of Alabama, a flood watchman was in force on the same day that the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which runs near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, is both located in Louisiana, and is expected to set a flood peak during the end of the month.
Director Alek Kruutmann said that both rivers could not come to several houses near Baton Rouge in the first regions.
He also said that there would be a threat to the flooding of the Ascension County along the river, when the flood rivers would return to Lake Marepas.
The Tickfaw River, running south of the Mississippi State border in the south of Los Angeles, was at the highest level of all time at nine o’clock in the morning.
The rescuers were still picking people out of the floodwater in the county of Which and in the region of Wilkinson in the south-west Mississ.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and son were close to the Gloster among those who were saved.
Hansford, aged 62, says that normally at a distance of more than 400 feet, the water of the Beaver Creek, which is located in his home, just died during the night.
He says that the other, a nearby half used him.
"We woke up, and the water just went on to go on," HansIX said.
Sei to the waist.
Hansford's wife told me again that she is not the water of the brook so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have injuries in all, and that he is the only one who is able to sleep.
Hansford said that the rescuers returned the three in a large, semi-style truck and took them to the Gloster firehouse, where the rescuers fell after them.
Kruutmann says that floods "are rapidly spreading" in the run-up to heavy rainfalls and that they are trying to design the designation criteria.
The Krautman says that one of the witnesses near the Livingstin is 13,75 inches of rain between midnight and the latest morning.
Krautmann said that the earth had been completely satisfied with the heavy rain since Wednesday.
The heavy rains and the flooding of the streets led to Tangiphoa County's residents being saved from their homes and taking lessons in four schools, they explained.
CBS's company WWL reports that in Tangipaho, a member of the council said that 200 homes were caught in a fire.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, but now they're flooded.
The president of the region, Robby Miller, said that they were trying to kill 72 people and 7 pets who had remained trapped in the floodwaters.
The cities of Mien and Hammond have been opened to those who have been evacuated.
"They'll come back to their homes when the water starts to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond in the district of Tangipah, a couple of streets were closed because of the floodwater, and residents were able to pick up sandbags to try to keep the water out of their homes and movements.
"The latest major flood was here today," said Lacy Landrum, the state government.
Here comes the same thing.
In Mississi, the President-in-Office of the Port of Harrison, Rupert Lacy, said that a steady rainfall continued along the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have arrived, but there has been no reports of a flood at this time.
Keith Townson, the head of the Shopper Value Foods movement in the region, has lived in the region for 40 years.
"have seen water in places where I have never seen it before," Townson said, "and it is still raining."
"Touch bullets" was six years old MahajCC to stop shooting at Philadelphia.
Tell them that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means the second six-year-old is shot at this month.
Parents told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown had a number of gunshot wounds to, among other things, the groin, the leg, the hand and the abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He was too much, his little body was full of bullets," the son's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the condition of the boy is recorded as critical and has been undergone in the course of the procedures.
The account tells the station that he is trying to recover.
The boy was beginning to be the first child in the local primary school.
I was one of the four shootings of people in the Germantown block.
Two three men were shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
Of the 29-year-old men, a critical condition was reported; two were in constant condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
A child shot from the front seat in one critical state with a 29-year-old.
Of course, there was no other problem in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
The investigators will tell CBS Philadelphia that it seems that there was a delineation between the shooters.
An attack will be executed by the kind of guns that come from various attack weapons, filled the scene.
It looks like it was definitely a question.
Kadu had seals all over the main corridor.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in the middle of a battle," said Ahthony Ginai, the Chief of Police of Philadelphia, to the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No checks have been carried out and, according to the information received, the police are investigating the surveillance camera's tapes.
Another six-year-old, girl, got caught in the misfortune on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in West Oak Lane's neighborhood.
He's recovering, and he's still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need to avoid Tome, Gabby and Laurieta?
That is why I call the Olympics team of this year, for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been in every summer Olympic since 19th April, and the USA has never been so ruling.
And so on: This team includes three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gappy Douglas and Laure "Laurie" Hernandez, who are inspired by many colour girls.
The composition of the team, which the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia are asking for, makes everything proud of.
The team looks, at all times, from America.
It is also established at the top of the species of dark and Latin American women.
The most successful military officer of the past six years has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is great.
In the most recent Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an all-time Olympic winner, and America was cheering.
Today the world has been given the opportunity to witness the incredible performances of the triple world’s Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, in which they perform unexpected, but masterly gymnastics programmes.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has repeatedly won the singles in the multiplicity of the world.
And Aly Raisman got silver.
I see the top of the game, but the situation doesn't look different from this in gymnastics across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all went along the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympics.
They are "Final Five" (last five) because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karolyin's last year as a coach.
The reality is, however, that gymnastics is an expensive type, and gymnastics are mainly engaged in private gymnastics clubs, which run those who pay for training, facilities, travel, uniforms, fees, fees, fees (for coach and their gymnastics, and for families) and so on.
some of the gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs which can be supported by a variety of facilities.
With these clubs, gymnastics get all the training, and this is a long and long-term commitment to the families of gymnastics.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Bales coach, and Maggie Haye, Laurie Hernandez coach, both have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We should provide cheaper and available fitness training for communities where you are inspired by Simonen, Gabby and Laurie.
Tit my foundation of gymnastics 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 young people (mainly blacks and Latins) and we have trained the animals and animals masters.
In September, we will be embedded in Detroit (My Home World) to offer a high level of gymnastics for young people who want to be able to learn and benefit from this important Olympic life.
Powerers generate strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as diligence, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and for school and work success.
The team's inspiration brings thousands of young people to the world of strength, and that's great.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
We live in a busy time.
Thank you, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing good respect for the "girl power" by winning the Olympics team, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to begin towards a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
Operators will organise new strikes after rejecting Mr Hunt's proposal.
Ministers had wanted to end the dispute with the agreement, which had been amended with the agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of the 37 000 doctors who had participated in the vote did so.
In July Hunt revealed his plans to sign the agreement, meaning that NHS was "in the unknown soil" and that even a small additional delay would harm staff and patients.
The first doctors will be changed to a new agreement, which will include changes in night and night work patterns to improve the management of difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Experts, said in a last-night opinion: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed decision, especially that it stimulates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
While the first group of doctors are only four weeks away from the new decision, progress needs to be made and the time is running out.
BMA companies resolve disputes through negotiations between the government on the part of the government on the part of them on the part of them on the part of them on the part of them, and at times on the part of them on the part of them, on the part of them on the part of them.
First of all, of Mr Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the refugee and take into account the concerns of the doctors.
If he does not do so, doctors will be prepared to fight for work.
The last strike in May meant a delay of almost 13,000 routines and 100,000 receptions when nurses and consultants were recruited to act as doctors on strike watch.
Ministers had wanted to stop arguing with the British Medical Association staff in agreement with the improved agreement.
BMA needs a better weekend pay contract with 54,000 doctors.
Daniel Multimer, the Executive Director of the NHS Eployers Agency, focused on the doctoral staff so that they do not go into the home.
Multimer said: "Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services already in a difficult situation, and they give cause for concern, anxiety and trouble, care and their families."
In the last two months, we held a central meeting with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of control (Guardan Role) and the revelations (Whistlebling).
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important topics - such as working, flexibility in education, further education on the Sabbath, training costs, mutual recognition of the teaching programme, freedom of freedom of movement and pay differences between men and women - is an indication of how seriously employers, the Health Education England, and the Ministry of Education are in the process of respecting the contracts concluded with the BMA in November, February and May.
A two-pound medicine may put a risk to the first instance.
Thousands of primary patients benefit from two pounds of the medicine that pays, after recommending that it be given to humans for longer.
Anticoagulant, ticagrelor, lowers the risk of massive seizures in people with a heart condition.
It is already being prepared 12 months after the event to calculate the risk of stroke or second seizure.
NH's supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given for a period of four days to ensure that there is still a risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now the NHS supervisor, NICE, has advised that it should be given for a period of four years, so that it is still a risk of heart and blood vessels problems.
Some 140,000 people get the first scene in England, and a third gets the second attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by a fat material that is formed by an aneurysm.
If a condensation cracks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the blood circulation to the heart, causing the first instance.
If a clot becomes loose, it can walk with blood and prevent blood circulation in the brain, causing stroke.
Those who have already had one seizure are at increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by AstraZeneca, a British company, and which is known as Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely that the merger will occur.
In today’s published NICE Guidance Document, it is recommended that 90 mg of ticagrelor be given to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin given once daily for the next two days.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of NICE Health Technology, said: "Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, even a fourth of the people who have been hit by a major situation will later receive a second cause or stroke, the consequences of which are often to be felt."
The fear of renewal can have a significant impact on the quality of life.
Evidence shows that tiagrelor together with aspirin is effective in calculating the risk of future events and stroke in people who have already had a situation.
When we first allow ticagrelors, we are glad to be able to increase the availability of available self-options for a number of people who may benefit from them.
Because the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially in relation to the risk of bleeding - is limited in more than one year, it is not recommended for longer treatment than during this period.
The culture of political correctness allows for the co-existence of Muslims to flourish in Muslim regions.
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, giving impetus to the reform.
The culture of political correctness is the fact that widespread voting fraud in the Muslim community has been ignored, is revealed in today's impressive report.
First of all, Minister Sir Eric Pickles told the police, the election administrators and the councils that they have ignored the evidence of malpractice 'cause of racial and religious hypersensitivity'.
The former Secretary of the Community, the emperor of corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on the basis of religious grounds is so serious that police should be allowed to set up guard chains to protect those who are afraid of asylum.
He recommends that voters issue an identity card in their vote to prove who they are.
Today, the vote must only say the right and the address.
The report even suggests that the voter's finger should be put on enormous black so that no one can vote twice.
The public authorities should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access to Council documents and decisions to be taken by the informal committees or bodies.
"This would not only protect the local government from malpractice, but would protect the local government more generally from the culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the occupation," he said.
The government ordered a report following the vote scandal at the East London Tower Hamlets.
The special election last year decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of the accusations of numerous acts of corruption and illegal activity.
In this context, it was noted that Rahman's "seriously false" Muslim community had religious feelings, as well as his critics' intimidation of racism and Islam.
Rahman says, "He led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious will of faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 votes were guesses or the result of a person voting on each other.
Sir Eric said that the evidence of honesty was found all over the country.
He was particularly concerned about the vote in the press, where members of the high-level Muslim community were said to have forced people to vote on the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the clearance of the voting system, including the identification of the identity in the identity card.
He says in his report: "The evidence was provided that the vulnerable groups of some ethnic minorities, especially children and young people, were being pressured to vote according to the oldest will, especially in communities with a background in the United States or in the country.
"There was concern that...the United States had ignored such behavior because of the hypersensitivity of the 'in fact correct' race and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 proposals for a change to the system, which included a prohibition on political activists to deal with recent polling flags in order to stop the "recovery".
The report examined by Theresa May also calls for the most recent amendments to the registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for the purposes of immigration and performance checks.
Consider options for proving the identity of the voters before voting.
It is absolutely necessary for a must-voting person to vote on a finger so that no one can vote twice.
Ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set the three-year limit for requests for automatic post-transmission voice-over.
Avoid political activists from dealing with media voice and envelopes that are being sent via mail.
Let the police set up security chains around the places of asylum.
Make it easier to blame people for being intimidated on the basis of a representation of the People's Act of 19 March.
Make the photo look like it's on the outskirts.
Require that the use of only English (except in Wales) is required in the case of sanctions.
Check to ensure that the staff maintains the rule that the voter has to go out alone.
~ Sir you are in Great London with police force saying that it is "excellent" and that no charge has been filed after the Tomlets case.
"The election will remain with Lutfur Rahman and his officials as a result of numerous corruption and illegal activities," he said.
On the basis of a number of criteria, he was found guilty of doubt, on the basis of criminal evidence.
He also criticised the ineffective "very bloated" controls in the parliamentary offices of the Parliaments.
Sir said, "For the last year, the Tomlets ruling was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glamorous search for the instigation of Parliaments, but this is a worrying and dark spread of clumsy and the denial of the facts of certain groups is a good thing."
Crazy Kate's cyclists double-crossing and other famous celebrities' images in the Olympics of Rio are crazy.
This week's fans at Rio's 2016 Olympics have been the past of a modern cyclist Pauline Farand-Prevot, who has proved to be the presence of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympic member is really not the only athlete fighting for each of them this summer, who can brag about his own famous being - at least according to social media.
In the interest of the Rio Games and all the famous events we are currently experiencing, FemAIL has compiled a number of Olympic athletes, which clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and wolf: The United States member of the Fleet Team, Brady Ellison, standing at the side, is the сöu Leonardo DiCaprio since she was a child.
In addition to Kate's sublime life on the bicycle tracks, many people have been quick to notice how a certain string shooter could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Mr. Brady Ellison, a member of the Fleet Team, has been advocating the story since I turned up in his pictures, where he appears to be alarmingly the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
As a matter of fact, aware of the passion of social media, the persuasionist stated that he has been seeing Le from childhood.
"I don't see a big match, except maybe for a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess he's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons in London in 2012 will also come up this year: an exciting uniformity between the British long-term jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor, they're going to make a difference.
The greatest, obvious image of Russian gymnastics Alya Fäntefan is believed to be the life of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
Underground south of Africa, Cameron van der Burghi has been the most recent Glee star in Matthew Morrison.
A bigger difference in the eye: This user believes that Nathan is an Insideon actor "sport version" of the "sport version".
A parallel long comparison has been between star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both having similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medallion judge Yulia Efimova is more than just the same actor as Annalynne McCord, while the United States team, Nathan Adrian, is one of the biggest fans in the world, according to the fans, "Joseph Gori's Portuguese version".
Hard women: Football Star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, share a similar look and eyes.
No: One information user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Submission of theory: According to this one, there may be a reason for a similarity between the two sides.
Another user has noticed on the site that "other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the star of the United States and Dexter's actor really have an incredibly similar look and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jenings and herself, which is almost identical to the character of the actress Laura Linney, as well as the most powerful gymnasticer Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide-sleeve is the Bring It On-star Gabrielle.
CBC's Olympic Commentator excuses the Chinese swimmer's "dead as a pig".
Byron MacDonald’s analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan’s fourth instead of women’s 4x200-metre- of-release message, the CBC’s direct Olympic mission was agitated on Wednesday by the analysis of Byron MacDonald’s 14-year-old.
The Canadian judge, CBC, has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during a small period of time that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "like the bad smell" and "like the pig" said.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-metre-free message final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporting team to bring in "colour", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China, baby.
He's too excited, he's gone like bad, he's dead.
Thank you for that."
Foreign Minister Ai Yanhan, 14, swims into another part of the second part of the message 1:7.79 - 1.6 miles slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to return to China.
The viewers around Canada are quick to respond to the language they use and to the tone of the language they use online.
Emmett Macfarlane said, "Did the CBC reporter just say that China's 14-year-old watchdog 'death like a pig'?
"The idiot didn't realize he was still on the live."
Ai Yanhania was photographed in a 4 x 200-metre-long message terminal in women's recreation as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China, bby."
The review of Byron MacDonald's knowledge was harsh and quick, in the face of many people.
The users of Twitter do not mind hearing how careless Byron MacDonald was.
info user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist crowd.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was running a mission from CBC, apologised for MacDonald's comment in the live broadcast, saying, "We would like to congratulate you on your comment on the idea of swimming.
It was a choice of words to choose from, and we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC decided to ask for more than 90 times from people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
The reporter colleague, Scott Russel, had to apologize for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and associated an invitation to more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonaldi's comments.
The TV company was also quick to forgive and gave an opinion.
We deeply regret that these statements are so, and that they were sent directly.
All of a sudden, we were quick to take action and asked for forgiveness on a live broadcast from our viewers and from our followers in the media.
For the sake of clarity, it is concluded that Byron’s comments relate to the management of the operation, not to the person concerned.
However, this was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologised for the live broadcast and just to comment by saying that he did not mean to interpret it as a written object.
"I would like to make a comment at this moment, which I made after the messages last night," he said at the CBC's Olympic broadcast.
"I made reference to the performance of the swimmer, not as a person."
"It must be unnecessary to say that I don't mean it as disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
The client of the mark was stunned by a woman who barely matched her underwear in the middle of the trade.
The customers didn't know what to look at when a guy was put off in the Shimark movement to try his underpants.
The things that didn't come to mind were that, after assessing how he looked in the pants, he peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to go around and actually arranged for four low-ends in the store, which was in the Bouvere Place Shopping Center in Folkesto.
Primark's move at Bouvere Place Shopping Centre in Folkese, where he set his underwear and then put them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the same store, said that after trying to get her underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without selling anything".
He said, "People didn't believe in their mouths."
The woman was standing in the middle of the market, wearing a couple of underwear, taking off her own pants and underwear, and putting on the set.
"He's still not trying to find a place to make up, he was just afraid of it."
"All were staring, while he was taking off his underpants, obviously, and he didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He also did three more times before he finally decided that he didn't like anything, talked again and walked out.
"he didn't seem to care who he was, or who he was, who would end up buying the underwear he made."
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent, said, "I hate to think that someone's taking home the underwear that someone else has tried but has not been cleaned."
The situation occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I said that the staff would probably try to remove the clothes from the sale rather than leave the store, which is fine."
"It would be terrible to go home with the underpants, and see that one has put them on and removed, and that they have not been washed."
Primarki said: "Primark is aware of the fact that Folkeston moved on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
You can defend yourself from armed attacks by using the Krav itself.
The world is dangerous, but this video of Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We are talking to the New York population with the Prime Minister of the Krav Magad Federation, Mr. Rhon Mizrach, to see how to deal with gun-wrecking shooters in the near future.
Either you've been sent for or you've been assured, the video will show you how to pay the insurgent with the same amount.
According to Mizrach, if you're coming back, the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attackers and "crawling fireline".
Then you grab the gun between the elbow and the top, as long as you hit the rest of your head while you're sitting on your elbow.
Take a knee-knee to the tip of your knee, and when the screener goes to pain, turn the gun out of his hand, hit him in the back of the gun and stand down and hold the gun on your head.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is: unfire the body, grab the weapon and turn it around so that the criminal can't launch.
I want you to put your weight on the gun and pull your head back, then turn the gun back on him, back off and let it go.
Does that make sense?
Watching how Mizrachi exactly knows this.
Remember, if you are not the Mayor of the Krav yourself, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up money.
A farmer, Ian Wright, is snooping around Europe for a driveway to the nearest parts of Europe.
A British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by bringing some of Europe's slippery and more connected places.
The director and author from Suffolk, Ian Wright, 51, ate the euro banknote, the handrail in PKKdilly Circus, the handkerchief in the big toilet, and the public phone in order to demonstrate the strength of his immune system.
Every time he licked each object, he used a photometer to show himself and us what he was going to do.
However, the attempt made by a film called "Internal Power" produced surprising results.
The idea used by some children to lick a hurdle device may seem completely loathsome, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in the sink.
On the way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
He didn't leave anything else in the mouth of the bad taste.
Wright became a tester of his bowels as a tester of endurance in his travels around the world and eating balms and wonderful things.
Of these public railway stations, the task of a toilet seat was indeed a test of his immune system.
In a movie he said, " ever since I was a child, I've been very careless about my health, and I've been in my mouth all kinds of things about soil, worms and bad water."
He really created a reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian toilet.
The screen had more than 4,000 units in a photometer.
In comparison, the majority of the hands of the counter-pest should be below 60.
In a single public toilet, he refused to starve when the result of the photometer was more than 4,000 units, and the result of the counter-washing hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, after internal strength, with a Finnish dairy, Option. The film shows a definition in different places, such as the penthouse.
In the movie, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more than that.
I'm not gonna do anything, it's gonna work.
After internal strength was produced together with Finnish usi, Valio.
The company offered Wright to Valio Gefilusta, which contains lactic bacteria, and vitamins C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Võorenmaa, Director of Playing Bars, juice and new generation, said: "We really wanted to offer you something new.
which would be fascinating to look at, which at the same time would explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'Let's go to Ian'."
They claim that interest in gutting is a future global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
A growing interest in the gut is a worldwide phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to share it in an interesting way.
The document also shows that we have a good sense of humor.
The director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say this: if Ian had any news about some of the things I asked for, like the main toilet in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Clearly, some of the suspicious things were better for iran, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty uniforms stored."
At the end of 2015, 84 per cent of respondents were associated with just stomach and intestine well-being, and 58 per cent said that at least they used products that have been modified to make them bakery.
The telephone family destroyed the building at Cornwall Saltash, before it went missing.
The erratic family caused the damage of £5,000 to their house after they were deported for the terrorist attack on their neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of a property located in Cornwall Saltash after several times had been complained about.
After they had been removed from the property by force, the employees of the tired housing company reported that the property was in a bad state.
There had been massive gaps in the walls, the tablets had been torn, the waste had been applied to the floor and the walls had been flooded with graffiti.
has now moved, and they are likely to live in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid of not being able to fix a thing.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the people, and I should not live in this way.
Here is much to think about, because this is probably known as Cornwall's less comfortable way.
This is bad news, and they're bad news.
The couple had a boy who was living in the middle of the night, and according to him, the violence of the economy was in the process of a street fight on baseball grounds, the intimidation of people close to him, drug abuse, drug abuse, and the indiscriminate screaming, arguing and cursing.
A 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was a rental contract, was decided in June on non-social behaviour.
Many of the rooms in the house under the threat of a break-out were found to have a solid place.
The place from which drugs have been used in the past, the tablets had been taken up.
The neighbors said that they saw him on the street, and that the police called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing evicted the woman and this partner from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks, the time to change voluntarily.
The rest of us were very excited to say that their lives had been in one place.
"They didn't care about any of them."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here incredibly many times.
"Today we did not dream.
We got up, because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it.
All right, now that they're gone last time."
Adam Fitzpatrick, managing director of the Cornwall Houses neighborhood, said that the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The house has lived in the house for 20 years, and the property was called more often.
Trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the apartment building.
"It is a pity that the resident is not responsible for his or her own conduct, because the eviction is always the last approach that Cornwall Houseing has taken.
This was very difficult, because behavior was strange, and I'm sure the neighbors were terrified by what they did.
I appreciate everything my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the work done by the members of the Community who gave us information.
I hope that this development will bring something to the neighbors and send a message that anti-social practices will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that the boys all lived at different times, but they were all in the twenties.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of a single bedroom after an emergency.
The work of the apartment must now be done at the house in the middle of the morning.
In 2014, the police made a raid on real estate and gained more than 70 g of cannabis, as well as whales, supplies and 1700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received fines in return for being able to hold a B-class something for the purpose of furthering it.
He claimed that the money was damaged for the tombstone of Lee Skeldon. This was due to a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are living homeless now that they're staying in private accommodation in Plymouth.
There were thousands of graffiti on many house walls.
They say they're trying to get rid of the people who keep the rules of their leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall's police said that the eviction was clear to other tenants who were trying to keep up the rules.
"This is a message for those who think that their behavior is without consequences, and for those who are in favour of such behavior," he said.
Devon and Cornwall will never adopt crime and antisocial behaviour. Work with their cooperation to protect our communities.
The residents in Portugal were decomposed when the submersible jet flew to the beach on a hippo-lower.
Sun service tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, were in a wake-up call.
The Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion plane would really be behind us.
The air force said that it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At the moment, terrible tourists were running out of control when the shower that was floating in the ground was all over the beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a ref aircraft almost reached the touch distance of the sun’s services on the sandy slopes of the north Portugal in Aveire, Aveire.
The lobbyists came to a halt when they seemed to be concerned about the noise from the computer, even though they did not see at first what clouds were coming for them.
An event occurred in Aveiro, close to Costa Nova in the afternoon.
One of the number of holidayers who made videos of a dramatic passing by in the media was Daniel Fernades, who said, "It went through all the time, and one point seemed to be running off to the country."
Nono Argoja added: "I was about to go surfing, and it really seemed like a plane was falling on me."
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro are terrified when the machine crashed out of the darkness and flew on an incredible distance.
The second air force today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify fishing vessels near the coast, and the plane had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the computer had gone much further than usual due to the poor visibility of the smoke from nearby agricultural farms, but the air force assured us that safety was not compromised.
This summer, the land fires have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal, and there are four of them in the area.
The Polish air force today said that the pilot had to shoot low due to the low-visibility conditions, the smoke caused by the soils and the thick fog.
The machine was on a training flight, and part of the exercise was requested to identify the goods on board.
Taking into account the results of the first half of the year, it is expected to be better than expected.
The South Karelian social and health (Exote) worked in January - June 3.4 million in a better way than planned.
The result was 4.3 per cent of the surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good for family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the installation to be opened up.
The May Guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Esote is trying to allocate a series of transactions to this year.
The difference covers the rest of the previous deficit.
The overrun may be used to reduce the number of lines and to buy measures.
The whole year is expected to be 4.6 million more than planned.
The White Government will deal with the mid-term review on the first Wednesday.
Seven out of seven special border boys swore a military whale in Imola.
Seventy alternates at the Sea and Coast Guards took a oath on the other side of the military force.
Immmola was hosted at a military conference at the Border and Maritime Guards School in Immmola.
The 10th MIF event took place with the Assembly’s agency.
A soldier took a oath from 70 alternates.
The end-users are trained to carry out the necessary border security, intelligence and terrorist tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for this year as a special frontier member.
For the selection tests, they were invited to 250.
Finals have been trained in Immola since 2007.
In the event of the event, the veteran meeting was attended by five veterans of the border forces during the last 20 years.
The average age of other people is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
Forensic intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 police institutions since 2014, RTA or criminal intelligence and analysis has been active.
One’s activity is outwardly invisible.
The Häme Police Unit comprises four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant in Lahti.
Auditor General works in Lahti, Finland.
One of the strengths is the IT dedicated staff in Hämeenlinna.
All of them work in a civil shelter.
The unit has demonstrated its capacity and necessity, see Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various reports to other police officers.
In need, it has, among other things, sought out information about asylum seekers.
Information on fresh working methods is available.
The establishment of analyses is an open-ended development of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police are at the most likely to leave the area of the whistles only when they receive an alert.
By means of a unit of information and analysis, daily police operations are targeted where they are most needed.
A single criminal intelligence unit, less than three national units, and a separate criminal intelligence unit were established in each police department along with the police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, in liaison with the central police, is operating nationally.
PTR units work in accordance with the principles of public policy, customs and border control.
RTA services work according to the police departments in the shared areas and have the task of providing information to both local authorities and the national units.
In the field of research, the scope of the dialogue is to be extended outside the territory of the territory of the other Party.
Where a single question is well aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the role of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Science also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, so that is what crime does.
R & D services have better computer skills than the basic policy.
Does the unit work by means of registers, alert database and logs to draw attention to new phenomena, product-type crimes or similar crimes?
This is being developed for sorting, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
People have their own ways of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's real or not.
The basis of the action consists of a certain image of the author.
Sorting can be done on the basis of whether or not it is done, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes.
RTA-unit workers do not travel around the city with their collars up and running, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both individuals and criminals are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals inventing their activities and thus trying to prevent crime prevention.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they are expected to pose a threat.
This was, for example, an early summer news, a way to make up for homes that were empty in the middle of the night.
Those who did put the apartment in an outer door stick, a second needle or a piece of tape that they were looking at were the residents really on the way.
The case file shall be at least for the parties concerned.
The analysis has found that the most professional criminals learn how to make mistakes.
The most clever order a protocol on the law of the commons, which may indicate, for example, that there are some fingerprints from the place.
The next time we go to the thieves, we go to the gloves.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppo from Häme to police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from East Finland police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu police station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from central crime police.
Methodology and consistency of information to plan common activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and finance volumes will be reduced.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-pronged PORA review, which ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation is used to provide information from outside the borders of Finland and its own institution.
Daddy's joined a trainee in Syria killed in London.
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schools that went from London last year to Is, has died in Syria according to rumors.
The lawyer, Tassime Akunjee, said the family of this deceased Syrian Raqqa.
The ITV News reported on Thursday that it was believed that it had died in an air raid by troops to Raqa, a base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she was just about to escape from her country and return to the United Kingdom.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of this case is that it can act as a tombstone and a will to others that there is a real risk of going to the country - that it can get people to abandon the decision making", said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other eastern schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they went by the border with Syria.
Sultana's family was told that she had gone to Syria to work with an Isis fighter, and that she only became a widow after a few months.
Reid says Clinton considers Garland to be the highest court-martial candidate if he/she is sued.
So far, leader Harry Reid says that he is convinced that the President of the Democratic Republic of Hillary Clinton will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Republican Republicans have blocked Garland's conviction since President Barack Obama appointed him in February.
Mr. Mitch McConnell, the majority of the senators, says that the next president will choose to replace Mr. Antonin Scala, the last Supreme Justice in the past.
Reid said at the teleconference on Thursday that he would predict "a multi-tier chance" by Clinton to choose Garland.
Reid's representative then said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he was appointed by Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team did not want to "play the trigger" with a new choice.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the Court of Justice of the District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republicans preventing Garland's name are the "proper" and "potentials" of President Donald Trumpin, President of the Republic.
He said that Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says that the naked calendar is "women as well as men".
The Treats magazine is working with Photographer David Belleme for the 1970s Pirell-inspired daily year 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are going to find their next top generation 2017 NU Muses calendar.
This year, President-in-Office Steve Shaw told me that he had a lot of nudity in a paper that differs from the Playboy of the old school's Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
For this woman.
Apparently, he thinks that each one is a child.
"We must again develop a timeless and classic nudity where men, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked body," said the press, in which the press release was published.
She's not gonna be part of this thing, because it's a beautiful art.
Models can create images on-line or publicly transparent selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
What's the point? Really?
Single, middle-aged people like to be vilified.
Before you rush to find out the comment in an annoying way about the insults that the author has with the name Not all of the singles of the ages, you can, realize that this argument is based on real-life information.
According to YouGov, the re-entry of a lot of records is not due to the fact that more and more of these millennia-borns are responsible for the novelty of physical objects, but for the mid-age awakening.
Apparently, those who have recently purchased a plastic disc are likely to be 45-5 years old.
In fact, in fact, the most likely way to buy is to belong to a age group of 18 to 24 years old.
It is also not only about the collection of amateurs, but it has an emotional meaning: it is a little likely that the buyers in the past (56% vs 53%) will be able to use them alone (69% vs 66%).
Is it the result of YourGoov?
If this blog were a television news report, it would follow me when I was on the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be very busy before I could get there, I'd make up my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's get to the point."
Let's find out more.
While Soho's charm and dirt is being removed - hotels, chain restaurants, shops and auctiones are now moving into buildings, where there were formerly independent movements - a handful of amazing specialty discs are still in place.
For the following section, I would probably like to ask the camera to stop shooting for a moment, as I am very close to looking at some of these shops in order to review their recent and emotional imagery.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (in Hungarian: two young women, three middle-aged men) at the Reckless Records (in Hungarian: three middle-aged men, one female, probably in twenty), spent less than a few hours in Hong Kong because of encounters, and went shopping for a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a financier.
"I am," he says.
There's about 3000 or 4,000 records.
These sheets, which appear above the picture (i.e. by e-mail, I did not follow her home), cover the walls of her living room.
This is the result of the creation of the largest number of records and singles: now he is able to buy a number of discs which he could not afford when they were first published.
"A large part of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early '70s, the albums that were published when there were 11 or 12, the albums that I was probably too young to make," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are most likely introverts who think about themselves, and he adds: "I don't smoke or drink.
This is my evil."
Wez, aged 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he met fit the YouGov profile.
However, he is a new wave of people with a media instinct. People who have heard that the discs have come back to fashion and that they have become a new one.
I have had a lot of discussions since then, and I've been able to get rid of my collection.
The customers who sold their CDs in their possession are now selling their CDs back," he says.
This can change the increase in the number of people who have woken up in a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional meaning?
In a trade like Phonican, it takes a few seconds to realize that discs offer a comfortable community for similar types of people.
According to Wez, some of the most important customers have been injured, especially by the close-out payment system.
Some minyl fans can disappear from the digital world and choose to be confident of the permanence of familiar sheets; articles that create the strengths of the days of your teen age.
"I think that it may always be a question of filling a hole or some kind of spell that is created by the possession of things," Wez says.
I myself, too, agree that this is true, and I believe that it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to make sense.
"We're like those workers!" said the other one.
In April, an opinion poll carried out by ICM revealed that nearly 50% of the people who had bought a hard disk in the last month had not yet tried to do so.
It was also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, whereas 7% do not have a record player to buy.
On this point, the news report seems to be seriously concerned about looking at the stack of boss nova collections in the boss.
This warning's "reward" aspect is something that is also worked by the Sounds of the Universe (contribution: three middle-aged men) by Jonny, 42, is expected.
"Somebody came in a while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to make a Interhead record so that we can do it on the shelf", he says.
This is not a big deal, but this is definitely what happens.
More popular, less music.
We go to people who say, "I don't have a record player."
I mean, no, it's the younger people, the late-age people who are just getting excited about it.
At this point in time, where there is almost a whole set aside for the venereals, there is a much larger audience when I arrive.
Seventy-seven-year-olds of Parcels, tourists taking photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is less relaxed than in previous movements - loudens the sound of Wild Best's latest pop, and the improvisation of jazz - is of course not seen by other customers.
One of them does not seem to be very lonely, but it is easy to prove that there is a serious psychological trauma at one another in the 30th century.
Eloara, 27, has been walking around the University for a few minutes, watching various records available for sale.
He's making buy-ins, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make money, so recording the record isn't really a choice.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to make music with you or something else, but the beauty is... she's falling in love.
"I don't know how to explain it-- it's really unique."
My last stop was said to have been the result of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfhes.
While I'm looking at it, I'm looking at a bunch of teenage girls who are growing up for a while around the Polaroid camera, before Dad and Mom thought about buying a Crossley record player.
On the left there is a coin covered with the albums of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winezy and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, any of the essential plates of the average collection.
They don't even look at them - probably because they're just ornaments, and they're so high that touching them would be.
This is a purely "articuistic" thing.
Considering that the few points these articles receive can mean more money for the industry and send a few more users to Soho to ask for more information, there is not much to complain about.
It should not be surprising that the population that is likely to have more time and more money is also the population that is most luxury, such as vegetals.
But even though my findings suggest that youGov's results are true at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude the large number of female collectors and pool producers that exist in the real world, in record stores and in online forums.
these people work hard at school or in the office.
They are not going to spend their Thursday mornings playing around at the Bernick Street record store, covering the plates and avoiding the creepy, 30-year-old turnouts looking over the easy-to-eat middle-aged men in this look-up.
Holker is the most widely used live animal video report.
Researchers say that the hackers have a longer life span than any other person on the back of the planet.
Haita, studied by Julius Nielsen, says that the record is on a female that is believed to be between 272 and 512 years of age, which is five metres long.
The German court rejects the request for the trade in Jungle from the refugee camp in Jungle.
The Court of Justice has rejected the Cás authorities' request to decommission dozens of ad hoc shops and restaurants from the Juggle camp where refugees live.
In this case, the Cés authorities argued that the State should be able to disclose all of the temporary trades in which people inside the camp are selling goods from projects to energy drinks, cutting or selling 50 cents (80 cents) or selling in a few or a few ad hoc restaurants.
The Calais Prefect Office argued that the rules will be broken down because they represent taxes on the unpaid economy and because they are a risk of fire and clean-up.
The humanitarian groups have informed the court that trade and food are vital in saying that free prices offered by the State Aid Organisation and other groups are not an important source of food for a growing human race.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often protect and provide meals to those who need food.
In Lille, he stated that there are no legal grounds for 72 people who are working on temporary trade, but said that the question of Cés' Mark "is perfectly understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, food and food was much bigger than just feeding people "in extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the appointments offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
Of the places under the one-stop shop, camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose operations are unprofitable and offer 200 bucks a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
Over 10,000 people have signed a petition to protect children from delinquency.
A letter sent to Guardin said that closing the cafe " would be a reality for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
On the other hand, the charity, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 90 000 - to think - after the number of arrivals was sharp during the summer.
In Finland, food prices fall more clearly than in the EU on average.
In Finland, it is low-cost, sharply, for the sake of public satisfaction and shame.
Food prices have fallen by nearly five per cent in Finland in three years, while the average EU country price fell by one per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and in the new world, food has become one of the most expensive in the world.
In the last three years, food prices have fallen in Finland in the second most of the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
Compared to the United Kingdom alone, the price of food has fallen more than in Finland.
In the article published by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of the Centre, published in the Tieto & Trentit blog, please refer to the section of the Ilkka Lehtinen article.
The Court compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general trend of consumer prices.
The latest data will be this year's summer.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose.
In the years, the prices fluctuated close to the price level for the year.
It was an alarming situation.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtän.
After which the food has come to be a little bit of a year since then.
Now the price-intensive Russian import bans on food, which have prevented food exports from Finland to Russia, are being imposed by Russia.
The supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the prices of production have decreased.
"The policy of the clean has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," says Lehtän.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to a fall in price.
The large trade chains the S-group and Soko have both calculated their prices.
For the second time, the price competition has been seen as a show of promotional campaigns.
In fact, in fact, Europe is not really a cheap food provider, even though the price of food has fallen.
In 2015, Finland was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, which had the same level of pay as Finland.
According to the paper, the price of food sold in Estonia is significantly affected by the price of food.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same percentage, Finland would sell the third lowest priced food in the same way as the third country.
The country compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the percentage of value added were in comparison countries of seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would be cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to go to the old EU countries at the price of food, we must halve the EU average and continue the price competition," says the paper.
The paper notes that the percentage of value added tax he has calculated is indicative.
Not exactly in practice anymore.
If you come to a school, you may notice that there is something going on in your school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed, which will be used at the beginning of the second semester in all primary schools.
It is the rule that every school in Finland operates.
You decide on your own details, but the method tells you the official goals.
The new instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the training of writing is given up, and, on the other hand, there is a process of coding in schools.
The teaching begins at least in the sixth grade, and the learning of social education begins in the fourth grade.
The Commission's proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
It used to be thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everything should be active and learn from each other.
This is how you need to make fun of school more interesting.

The figures make it the longest in the world.
In the field of science, it is only passed by an Islamic shrub, which has been scheduled for 507 years.
The Greenland sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
It also holds another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch the dogs further, they can still be more than five metres away.
As the growth rate is slow, the rate of follow-up is only about a centimeter per year, and some adults have already been living for a while.
How can we not be sure?
Mr. Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
The most important of the two women in the icefish, which remained in the fisherman's fishing zone.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radio navigational investment of the larvae.
The average time of search of the examined bodies proved to be at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fishes in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
As it has been found in previous studies that the ice-cream equations only reach sex maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they were in fact about 150 years of age.
The study was conducted.
Stockmann's dismissals for almost 300 sellers will not be reduced.
Almost 300 members of a commodity company from Stimman.
The joint ventures in the troubled society ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of these discussions, about 300 jobs, the main part of which will take place on termination," Stockmann explains in his information report.
According to it, the number of sales of goods will not be reduced so that the consumer service does not charge.
In addition, about 80 employees are offered a new job.
The total number of employees covered about 3,000.
At the beginning, the measure was estimated to be approximately 380 people.
A small reduction is expected to take place in the next 20 years.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme which is intended to cover the savings of 50 million this year.
On the back there are the difficulties of Stockpiling to make the goods trade more profitable.
In the second quarter, the Group’s adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11,1 million, still losing goods.
According to Lauri Vejalainen, the Managing Director of the Stockmann See, sales in the sales sectors have not served the purpose of setting up a company.
"Personal reductions are, unfortunately, necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail performance in 2018", Vejalainen explains in the notice.
Against the backdrop of the second quarter's performance improvement, the success of the chain Lindex was still good.
Ketju achieved its best second quarter of all time turnover and revenue.
The net sales of Lint increased by EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
Last year's total Stockmann Group operating profit amounted to 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will change from last year.
The revised operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure centre in the north of Finland keeps the weather on a rainy Friday, says H's meteorologist Ilona Lang.
There will be rainfalls in the central part of the country, but the south is pout.

Which public sports team is exciting a strange explanation of the doping scandal of coaching coaching.
Anzra was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it turns out that Anzra appeared as a national team athlete in doping tests.
The news agency AP told us that the athlete, when Anzrah tried to appear, is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Who's national team member Stephen Arac Sou told us that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to the authorities of Anzra.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home, where he "promised his crime against each of the national troops".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a sample and even issued documents.
This is not acceptable", President Kip Kein, of the Olympic Committee of Kenya, called on the news office Reuters for information.
Olympics' public sport begins on the other side, and Rothini is scheduled to run right at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was established last year in the World Championships in the fourth quarter and has pre-empt Rio’s winning services.
According to Reuters, the source of the activity in Kenya's public sports team was the fact that Anzrah was driving with a sportsman's accreditation card only to get free meals in a small town.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a sportsman and he was taken to the test.
The director did not explain to the officials because he was afraid he would reveal himself," he said.
All right?
The public sport platform is empty.
You all right?
At least not at Rio's Olympic Games watching the general public.
In Rio, a struggle for public sports medals began in the first place, but the world's top people have found their skills confusing for nothing to look at.
Rio’s organisations once again reported that only 58% of the first-day flags and 65% of the flags of the late-night competitions were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was hurried by a cheering crowd.
The flags of the waves are already sold out in Rio.
The absence of Olympics at the Olympics in Rio has already attracted attention to public sports before.
For example, there have been thousands of empty parking spaces in the views of rugby, melon and the organization.
At the same time, the American goal was Talita Antunes and Larissa, playing the beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the house was full.
After the second two, the Netherlands played against Russia, and it was now about 30% of the 12,000 views.
At least the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian competition tourists, and many of the Olympics are far-fetched to Brazilians.
I mean, even the first game of the football team couldn't get caught up in the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a contestant informant, told us that 82% of the ticket was sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There is still 1,1 million left for sale," Andrada said Reuters.
Eightty-five million tickets to the London Olympics were sold at 8,2 million, even though the flags cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have been around EUR 9 from the openings to over EUR 1 000.
Half the ticket costs less than EUR 16 per ticket.
At the Olympics in London, volunteers and military staff were sitting empty, but in Rio, this is not yet allowed because the organisers need money and are trying to get tickets to sell from the moment to the moment.
Indeed, in Rio, the organisers have given 240,000 tickets to less known types of school in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places on the Rio stadium this afternoon.
Even the beach volleyball on the Copacabana sand has not been interested in the audience.
Yokka Messalo threw up in London in 2012.
That's enough for a little magazine.
New ways of protecting nature - right to land
Helsinki Foundation will participate in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquired ecologically important sites.
After that, private, corporate and community entities can redeem their rights to the country with money.
The Foundation has obtained its first acquisition of land in the Gulf.
The territory is actually divided into a series of caves that can be acquired by those who wish to acquire a right against payment.
The fisherman receives a power of 184 square times the size of the whole chain, which means in fact that it is not necessary for each holder to approve if the use of the land is to be changed.
The administrator's rights can also be acquired for more than one log.
Acquisition of control is something concrete that can be submitted as an inheritance or a gift.
There is no need to go to the back of the bats or chains somewhere else to hold on to the environment", the right to acquire all of Juha Leviekiri is based on the facts of Juha Leviekiri.
The right-holders receive accurate location information, which allows for a visit in the area, for example.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the rightholders are displayed on the same map as the data on the land area.
The paper sees the nature of its procurement as a risk only because the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest designed to promote the environment and the environment.
It is a matter of fact that the Foundation would act in some ethical or scientific way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Manager project is nature conservation, so that they cannot be touched and in peace.
A foundation for the acquisition of land by purchase or sale of land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights, but the Foundation has acquired its original ownership by virtue of its founders.
The foundation is intended to provide more protection for the countries concerned.
It also aims at Finland's external borders and plans for immigration from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will review its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market on 13-19 August.
The cyclists torture the largest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your home.
Bike thieves torture Turkey, the worst of the major cities in the world.
This year, more people have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the bicycle thefts reported to the police, the number of major cities in January to August this year have stolen bicycles and parts thereof per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose at the top.
According to the police, from four to five bicycles per thousand inhabitants, four to five bikes per thousand inhabitants.
On the other hand, in Espoo and Kouvola, the police were only informed of about two bicycle return per thousand inhabitants.
After all, it's a difference.
"In other cities, relative to the number of inhabitants, there is a double number of thefts compared to others," says Tommi Reen, the Inspector of the Board of Governors.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the road.
It is extremely clear to understand why more people in Turku have been stolen than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
"The frequency of inspections can be influenced by the amount of traffic in the city and the number of plays at all", worked by Chief Officer Teemu Äkäs.
The Tommi Reen of the Board of Directors is waiting for Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top of the line.
To a large extent, the amounts of circular theft go according to what are the cities of study and trade.
The market has a solid center, short distances and lots of spins for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different city, where the centres are far away and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
A little less bicycle theft has come to the attention of the whole of the police in January to August than in the previous year.
There is still no subject for joy.
Over the last few years, more than 20,000 bicycles every year become aware of the slowdowns.
It means 50-60 filers every day and only in Helsinki for about 4,000 days.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more clowns, for only some of the victims are reported to be in custody.
Reen calls on people to report a crime on a round-the-clock basis, at least every tenths of police reports.
The typical cleared bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in a carnage.
"The cases will also come to light in connection with other investigations, when a case of a drug case in the house may be stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught on a weekly basis in the course of their activity or in connection with a police investigation, says Chief Officer Tim Leppämäki.
He believes that the wheels are being stolen, for example, from the commercial centres’ bicycles, the inner courtyards, warehouses and wheelchairs, i.e. wherever they are usually stored.
For one of the bike models, the most recent way to save Joki is to take care of Joki.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some of them take the bikes for their newest modern use, but most of the stolen ones end up in the store, for example, by using them.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it has not been known that stolen wheels would go almost abroad," Reen says.
The shoppers of the stolen rivers are, according to their opinion, common Finnish.
I'm sure you can buy a part of the stolen bike without knowing it.
Some might have doubts about it.
The shoppers who have been visited must be careful, as they may commit a crime of hiding or an offence.
"The alarm bells should ring, if the good 15 wheels come to light," Reen says.
Official of the Agency Severin Hírvi makes sure to use the colour scheme Nopssa always for his working day in Helsinki, Finland.
He's had five wheels, but no one's been stolen, Hiri says. "He hasn't been taken, there's a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so tempting to thieves, this is not necessarily a hipster's," the Helsinian Hirvi was wondering.
The quick-to-reacher in the Kiosk in Helsinki, Kallio, has a small U-lock on his bike.
Now the wheel was pointed at the wall of the swing, but in general Valve is locking the wheel on a fixed one, such as a wheelchair.
"There is a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I have to do," says the Helsinki student on his bike, whose body alone is about five hundred euros.
"All the time I hear from my friend that I've been taken."
"Mostly bad brains, like a bad-ass boy."
The house was stolen from the house.
Although the bike had missed, Valve was able to wait for it to be abated.
Less than 15 years of responsibility for any of the following:
experimenting with a familiar peerlighter from the United States
In Helsinki, so-called peer-lighting is being tried to prevent people from becoming involved in the criminal cycle.
The experiment is initially applied to persons under 15 years of age, who are now leaving without criminal liability.
A peer-reviewing team is lacking in one of the young people's goals.
The idea is that a peer-lighting team will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a fine.
The victim of the week later may himself be involved in the peer-reflecting crew in order to compensate for his actions.
The consequences may be, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director General, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other models that are used in parallel.
"All young people are directed towards a more responsible direction so that everything does not go missing from the second mistake," says Latio.
The reference fleet has been sampled from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first few years, the child does not have to be in front of the adult panel, but reflects on the situation with about the same age.
_Other Organiser
The following service editor of the Palmu service office, Mr. Kaikka Lovio, tells us that this was an attack, which was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes of the people under the age of 15 years may not have been committed before.
"It's been a message that you've been on your way," Lovio says.
The reference lighting is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Youths, which is based on the city and Me-digy.
It stresses that new policies are needed for everyone, not just for immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to end the Trump campaign fund.
Over 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the Party to withdraw the financing of Donald Trump's presidential election.
The letter was published by the United States newspaper Politico, who had been given a statement of this.
According to the paper, the letter was addressed to the President of the National Committee of the Republics, Justice Priebus.
The signatories will allow the Party's money to be directed to the United Nations elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his negligence, inability and record disadvantages threaten to bring about a vote for the election Democrats," according to the letter said Politico.
Only the direct transfer of all funds to the political elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning the Trump-decorated anchorage of their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be possible, as the chances of the Trump being able to help the presidential elections become smaller every day.
Polico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are the politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who have written a letter is apparently Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who are entitled to the majority of the defence" and that it is not a case of support.
The paper reads a number of Donald Trump acts which are believed to have offended many voters.
He is also said to have shown severe authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this year, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton allows relief for families with children in the United States of America.
United States Democratic Prime Minister Hillary Clinton told me about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
Clinton's plan is based on a massive, 2,000,000-dollar five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This is in particular the case of real tax increases, in particular by means of private money.
The work programme is a hand allocation to the other south-westers who suffer from the transition of factories to low-carbon countries.
Clinton called for more investment in paid jobs after World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build.
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like he was at least stressing from Alters that people should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to be tax-free, it will have to pay the tax, Clinton says.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which is supported.
"As President, I am opposed to all trade agreements that act against employees or wages", Clinton promised.
According to recent speculations, the Washington Post magazine, prior to Clinton's speech, stated that Clinton was going to criticise the public economic programme of Republicans Donald Tru on Monday, that "it only favours millionaires of this kind".
In the past, Clinton has previously named the "Trump loophole" as a "Trump loophole" to the company's network.
Thursday, Clinton insisted that he was the father of a small entrepreneur himself.
It reminded me of hearing about small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has failed to pay, and about the clothes Trump himself manufactures in the USA and the USA.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America", Clinton was saying.
The signs of Rio's viewer are: The little ones have not glued Finnish to the screens, but the mobile application is important.
Usually, commercial competitions see television viewers as sharp mountain peaks.
Rio Olympics have not yet reached high audiences.
At the same time, the trackers have glued up to 12 per cent of the population at the top of the screens: Tuesday night swims followed by 615 000 viewers from the Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For the purpose of comparison: one month’s annual public-public-public-sports EM competitions had almost 800,000 viewers at the TV2 site, and one month’s European public-sports competitions were fair to one another.
So far, most of the Olympics have been interested in Sunday night biking and the 5th day of the competition, which has opened up the competition, which has reached almost half a million viewers at the Olympic Channel at one time.
Panu Pokkinen, head of sports, is pleased with the audience figures, and points out that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, the Finns will be following the next Olympics from Rio Areena.
I am pleased to see how many of the TV news audiences in general are elected by the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are distributed to TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has owned a whole network of channels.
When the mission arrives 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 50,000 all the time, that's a good idea.
The ratings are lower than in 2012 in the London Games or 2008 in the Beijing Games, but the difference in time - a large proportion of Rio's broadcasts will be in Finland during nighttime.
The second reason for a blatant demonstration - if someone now thinks it's thin - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: If Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early games, the interest would have bounced up the top of it.
In addition, public sport is still in the process, as is the case with other Finnish interests: sailing and farming.
The initial figures have been close to Poknen’s estimates.
When the general public starts, the numbers of viewers explode.
Yle launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for cats, which, on the first days of the competitions, went up at the Apple App Store for the most free-charged applications in Finland.
The application for land use had been loaded 10.000 times.
I'd bet we're already on our way to 200,000 downloads.
"Very good viewer numbers will be used until later", says Pokkinen.
Rio Arena has not worked for all users on purpose.
Positive says that feedback has come and errors have been corrected.
The use of Rioarena has been accompanied by delays and other minor problems at the beginning.
Applications have produced updated versions that should correct errors.
Rio Olympics will be seen on the Yle Channel and in the arena more than any other sport event ever before.
Some species may be monitored by the Yle Fem channel, and on the Internet, Yle Põe cares about pets every day.
The Olympics are not only likely to be working for the above, but also the only ones that can be followed only by the above channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sport will be visible both at the Upper and at the market channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is the Päijänen, whose depth is at the Crossback 95,3 m.
It may be even longer.
The technical language trainer Matti Kannela found on the cross a publication of about 20 metres from the base of which the Diving Computer showed 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency was intended to strengthen its efforts by all means.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of 100 meters, says Development Engineer Jari Ha Kala.
So far, therefore, the full depth is still 95,3 degrees.
The deep lakes are Inarijärvi ( 92 meters) and Suvaswater (90 metres).
Saimaa, secondary waters and Lakes are over 80 metres away.
It's not exactly as much as it's a Päjäjätte.
The bottom of Inarijärv has not been specifically mapped.
"That would make it possible to look at unknown depths," Kannella asked.
If the deepest lake with the help of the center, it is the Great Lakes, 23 metres.
In this way, your Päjäjä will not be able to get into the 10 deepest groups, and Suvasvesi will be even further off the top.

Immediate tax burden: Pensioning is still tighter
Pensioners' incomes are becoming increasingly tighter than wage earners.
I admire the fact that this was the case during the parliamentary elections and that the payment of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
The government statement does not include.
We believe that that is what we believe to be.
The promises made should be continued after the election, he says to the Western Media.
This year, wage and salary earners came to work income reductions that would reduce labour costs.
In this Parliament, I was briefed by representatives of the Opposition, who were concerned about the choices made by Alexander Stubbi (co.) to finance the financial crisis.
The purchasing power will be secured, it will not increase.
According to Minister of Finance Petter Orpon (Kok.), one of the priorities of tax reductions is, in my view, primarily to safeguard the purchasing power and not increase it, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on leverage and employment if other things do not increase human uncertainty.
It is a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) and Orpo's messages for the purpose of respecting the agreement reached with great effort.
He says that it is important to adhere to the Treaty for credibility..
It is a regular economic and economic activity.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be shaken by reason of doubt.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much on domestic demand and on the basis of human future religion.
A change in the length of unemployment in the event of a change in the situation of long-term unemployment.
Admirable appeals to the government that it would be in a budgetary crisis to stop unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
In addition, there were about 17,000 more persons unemployed than in the previous year.
He says that if you don't stop, the target employment rate from the increase to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large fall in society.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims known to be made aware of the attacks in the country.
At least four people were killed last night in this country and last summer.
The Embassy calls on Finns on the ground to be vigilant and to avoid the most urgent tourists and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no need to withdraw from the country for explosions, but you should follow the instructions from the Embassy on the grounds of prudence, says Mr. Westphalen.
Very few Finnish people in the Netherlands.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finnish people in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to evaluate.
The Finnish travel period in Thailand is scheduled for the calendar year.
Most of the tourists in the country come from South Europe and from China to this day.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finnish people in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has been trying to seek out Finnish information in particular on Hua Hin.
Several of our staff at Hua Hin are currently absent.
In general, everything seems to be okay, Westphalen says.
No reason for the event
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The Ambassador thinks that events may be related to the public unrest of Thai society and the last week's referendum on the constitution of the Soviet Union.
The law is adopted in the vote.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were kept who were aware of their opposition to the law were held.
In the southernmost provinces of the country, the principle of ethnic conflict in the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims can add to the right of self-determination.
However, the latter has not been extended to trade relations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
Here is where the queen's son and mother's day will be celebrated.
Transport in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the day’s flow so that they are very accurate.
Police in Thailand: The search is not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, says the Thai police office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourists' favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a popular tourist destination, a holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs last night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current actions, they did not require the death victims.
Remove two explosions according to a magazine on Patong Beach.
Two bombs exploded in Pang Nga, where one person was wounded.
The first tourist destination in Hua Hin has, according to the local authorities, blown up all four of them yesterday and today.
At least one killed in both double-bombs September.
In addition, in the south of Thailand, in Surat Than, and in the city of Trang, at least one ring exploded in each of them.
At least one person died in each attack.
Surat Thani is also well known to several tourists, through which it is transported to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The source of the attacks is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of the General Military Directorate, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to sneeze people anymore, he told journalists.
According to Deputy Security Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks on Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He said to Mr B.B. that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most urgent tourists and to follow the instructions of the public authorities.
There is no reason for Finland to withdraw from the country for the purposes of the explosions, but there is no need for immediate instructions on the precaution, says Westphalen.
In the open Europe, we have a lot of people.
So far, very little is known about the blows and their victims during the summer.
Last night's attack on Hua Hin has brought you more information.
There was still a local woman and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The number of wounded is at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were injured in the most recent attack by Hua Hin.
The bomb exploded in the vicinity of the well-known bell tower.
The Thai PBS says he's isolated Hua Hin, where he believes one more time.
According to the governor of the province, the Palace of Surat Than had been hidden in the florists.
At the time of the attack, the government worker was killed.
The wounds are at least one.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN tells us that there were also two bombs in the Surat Than attack that exploded about half an hour ago.
According to Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States of America won the four fourths.
The United States of America Raisman was the second point of 6.4.98 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third of 58,665 points in performance.
Biles, 18, reaching out to Rio's little ones for more telematics periphery, jump and boom.
Bales has been in control of women's gymnastics for the past few years.
In the last three months, the two personal worlds of the world.
He has won the fourth and final championships three times in a row, both in the last and the second year.
On the team, Biles has won two team competitions in the world of the world.
Slower MM dimensions at the Party are jumping and going from the Pole.
In the Netherlands, the Finnish ombudsman: "The person has no influence on the change".
Esa Huovila, who runs the event agency in Phuket and a children's club in the same country, has not been concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on the ground.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that this will result in anything more amazing, estimated as a Finnish attorney in the United States for about twenty years by Huovila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many of Thailand's tried tragedies.
There's always something.
At first there was a tsunami, then something, and last year, a bombing in Bangkok.
If none of these former tourists have been deported by tourists, that's the way it is.
Höjtlan's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Hula heard a blow from her own work.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. and said that there was no reason to come to the office.
Hula says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early because of the attacks.
Where I work most often at work, my local staff will be in a position to work as usual.
They thought the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and celebrates the festival in Thailand.
On Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to allow about an hour and a half of local time.
Many on the beach had not even heard about the blows.
Half-time in the Thai time at Patong the traffic was normalized and most of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovla, who visited the site.
Later, the car in question was seen in the Kruunukäi at Jouxomini.
When the police arrived, the car had been set on fire.
The patrol detected two man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-six.
Hold on a second.
The other one got away, but the man was found later in the forest by a cop dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and serious damage to the vehicle.
Thank you for the clues.
The Executive Director of the Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking on the changes to the Director-General of the Joint Undertaking: Clear decommissioning.
In Russia, one of the most senior executives in the years when President Vladimir Putin separated the Head of his Administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the Estonian 44-year-old Aton Vaino.
He's an ex-deplomate and he worked as the second man in Ivanov.
The Kangaspuro says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov may be that Putin's desire prevents you from being able to understand too much power around him.
adding that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is the way to prevent people from bringing that power to power.
There is also a possibility that Ivanov may have been involved in any conflict with other officials or screwing up.
Replace the fall in Ivano's place.
Ivanov, an insider of the Putin, is moving to specific tasks in the field of environment and transport.
On a tape produced by state media, Putin made a joint decision to convert it into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had changed to another task and suggested that the Empress be replaced, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov, this is a clear de-position.
Environment and transport are not in such a high order in the current state of affairs.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the president's Security Council.
Ivanov joined Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but the president was Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as governors, has been replaced in recent times.
Senior Researcher Katri Pynnyniemi from the Institute for Foreign Affairs says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's location is the fact that Putin is going to be closer to the younger one.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields for their withdrawal in Syria.
They used civilians as a human being in their escape to the town of Jarabulus, so that we would not aim at them, said Sheikh Darwish, a representative of the United States Council of Manbij.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the population was located in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last year, Arab and Kurdish fighters came to control about 90% of the importance of Fathers from Manbij.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Updated at 7:30: At the beginning, we were wrong to say that the civilians were on the run from the city, in fact, the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians on the run.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's paper publication agenda is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's order to the public is a legal act, according to Professor of Public Law Tomi Voitulainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
It tells STT that the document can't be based on the law rather than the law.
The Ministry of the Interior refused earlier to release the Minister of the Interior's appointments to the list of participants for Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the Government Office and the fact that the information had been recorded on a daily basis rather than on a database basis.
The Executive Director of the Ministry tells STT that there is a strong need to reform practices in the ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio.
Last year, Bolt has been running out of value competitions for a while.
He hurt the early part of his life and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Games.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've done well and that's the main thing, Bolt said in his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and fans.
All around the port of Utti, it follows that the Jamaican star has risen in the period of one of the public sports has been struggling with doping scandals and sledding interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympics came to Athens in 2004, when he lost 200 metres at the beginning of the year 21.05.
About 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loosen your practice position.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, where he thwarted the world record and the self-confidence of the competitors at the time of the final headquarters of 9,69.
This is more likely to happen.
Later in the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career at a point in time.
The worlds that have been created in the past 9,58 hundred metres and 19,19 seconds are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is reaching 200 metres of world record and 19 seconds below, but that it is to be achieved by nothing but Olt himself.
In Salassa Bolt's battle challenger is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the 200th Olympics in Athens in 2004.
Last year at the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During the reign of Bolt in Beijing, it has not been lost in the finals of the value contests at any time if only one is on the way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th MM final was left by Bolt without running for a half-time.
The Bolt will be filled in in more than a week after 30th.
He's an old man in the men's hands, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
For the last time in my career, Bolt has set the World Cup in London next year.
These are the Olympics that separate me from you.
I'm older and this is more like it.
But every time I'm down, I'll remind myself: this year I'll have to do it, Bolt said it then in the Illusrated interview.
Exposures to Rio: two athletes are suspected of doping.
According to Mr. Chen Xinhua, Chinese judge Chen Xinyi, 18 has given a positive doping test at the Olympics in Rio.
There were the last of the prohibited substances found in the doping sample of Chinese Judge Chen Xiny.

Skkelton is not very stressed if the som or British magazine has a little noise about his public and special costumes.

Skelton has gone into high-interest shoes and a short dress, which certainly has at least sufficient transparency - at least for many conservative British warriors.
However, rear-end steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and small things are just the right thing to do.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be sleek, and he's trying to be a little nervous, but he's stressing that he doesn't want to play the lead role.
This isn't about me, he knows.
There is sports here, and the focus must be in the athletes.
It shouldn't really matter why I'm dressed.
Can you imagine the court has reached me?
I can't, but all I can do is focus on how these swimmers do their jobs and how big they make their sacrifices, it's okay for me, Skeltto makes fun of it.
You know what?
It's out of nowhere, if it comes from (trainer) talking.
I'm a little bit amused if one of them has hit a radar.

BBC: ManU's buy-in for a gaming ban does not see in the opening of the Electoral League.
The world record player for football moves is not seen in the field when the Valioliga kicks in the night.
Paul Pogba's gaming language followed with him.
Manu’s open Manu’s open speech against Bournemorth, reported BBC in March, is the first time that Paul Pogba’s biggest buy-in in Manchester, Paul Pogba, is on the sideliness of the game language.

At Flow, the grandeur is a virtue.
Attractively precise criteria and ambitious visions have stabilised the position of the Flowers at international level as an event of appreciation for the stars of the world’s world.
Flow will start in Helsinki.
Fairy-walkers have typically expressed themselves with their own personal manners.
The main stage of artists is in the punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylized by, for example, artificial grass and art installations.
It is always not enough for us to be just a head and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the director or director of the event.
The Flow Festival in the Gulf of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
Against the background of success is the simple question: What event do the authors want to go to?
In the event of events, it is quite different to think this way.
Often the aim is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the mandates, reports the event or the director Tuomas Kallio.
This week before the event happens, he knows that Flow will be sold out this year as well.
The goal has been to raise the number of 70,000 people in the last year by 15,000 people.
There are also a number of interesting national and foreign artists at the titles this year.
The increase in the volume is a good thing, because there's got to be something to do with it.
On the other hand, we don't want too much, because somewhere along the line, it's like a bunch of cattle that's being taken off at the great fairways.
We don't want to.
The ideology of a successful event has been expanded for 13 years in such a way that the artificial grass in the soms area has 130 present, art installations as well as numerous points and drinks bars.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, this year 15,000 people's tents will be operating as a gig spot.
Kallio admits that the event could happen again.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to capture Flow's life.
If it's lost, this isn't us anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work is that even today's great visions are the way they are today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, activity was very dependent on the support of some EUR 20 000 in the city.
Last year, the net sales of Flow's operating stock company were on average net.
This will allow you to create "crescent things", as I bring in 73 m distance between the tent and the building.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own manners.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about the community of trendy adults.
However, the event has not consciously deteriorated to a very fashionable stage.
The main purpose of this is to distinguish between the content and the content, above all.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit in with the world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with others, says Kallio.
One of the main stage artists this year is the legend of 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
Who has a huge group of fans in his own generation, but he is not the most popular performer of the festival, where he has indareck, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kalli, Iggy was blind because now is the time, this is on the job in Finland.
We care about everything, the future.
It's not just what's being played on the commercial radio.
The latest album is damn good and he's done some damn jobs in recent years.

The people ran up against me and said they blew up.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Swedesman Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladit.

I mean, Hua Hin's is the second second second bombing shot.
At least one dead and three injured.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the Trang bomb.
He told me about Hua Hin, knowingly, at least one who hadn't yet tried to explode.
According to the authorities, there are likely to be rebel troops behind the bombings, who are not concerned with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
The public authorities consider that this may also be a matter for the public.
According to Aftonbladet, crime-related organisations have recently been involved in trafficking in human beings.
XSML: This part of the new stand-by force is going to battle in the event of an emergency first.
In an acute emergency, military officers are called upon to perform their duties only after several months after a military oath has been given, reports the Middle Finn.
According to the head of the Defence Forces, Brig-Gen Jokka Sonninen, interviewed by the paper, for example, 5.5 months of service in the military, only those who are at the end of their education will be able to fight in the event of a military situation.

Pamela Tola received compensation for her home house.
A player, Pamela Tola, and her former husband, the CEO, Eli Waroma, have won a hard fight about the housing they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The trade price of the Collage Division had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which resulted in a dangerous microbial growth for health.
In 2014 a couple of cities sold the apartment as a fit-for-release year.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, resulting in losses to Tola and Waroma of up to EUR 198 000.
The couple took care of the matter and demanded a price from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court.
Court judgment in the case-law on Wednesday.
It held the judgment in force in which the sale was ordered to pay Tola and Warom EUR 100 000 for the sale of the price.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 3 for the costs incurred by the couple.
The court was justifiable about the price reduction, as some of the rental needs of the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when the sale was made.
However, according to the Court of Justice, obvious building errors were substantially more serious than what had been said.
Tola is looking for a good home.
At the courthouse, Tola told me that the couple had been looking for a good home because they didn't want to do any repairs.
He had the impression that the building was repaired and in good condition, and that it was not against the facts mentioned in the fitness check report.
The health inspection report referred to the need for and the inaccuracy of the air and the lack of adequate management of the rain and melting water that flows along the seabed.
On the basis of these efforts, it was not apparent that it was in any way an urgent matter.
Tola and Warma remained convinced that much rainwater might have to be broadcast in a few years.
Last night on February 4.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity conditions in the water were much more serious than expected.
The audits carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed a microbial increase, according to the Witness, due to both the huge rainfall and the capillary increase in soil moisture.
The air contaminated by half the house by microbes could, according to the inspector's assessment, be allowed to enter the indoors, as well as through the indoors.
Healthy access, limit values above home or cross-country or cross-country skiing was found in petals from the living room, the basement stairwell, the living room, and the basement bathroom.
The terraces are built without permission.
In court, there was also a dispute as to whether the dwelling was contrary to the extended permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of Espoo to authorise changes to housing before the transaction.
Among other things, the steels had been built, even though there were no relevant permits yet.
Home problems were, however, a key issue in justice.
According to the court, the buyers could assume, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before, that the building would be suitable for living and that there was no need for repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of Tola and Soma, the Court of Justice did not have any real reason to carry out a wider review of the standard.
The parties have not failed to fulfil their obligation of entry, the Court of Justice in its judgment.

The tip of the head had imagined doing a record that was telling the story about his own life, but the words in the divorce note were not true, but it was written on the basis of a 7-day newspaper.
In the news of the newspaper Jari and the ex-lover divorce, Jari was told that she was overtly talking and drinking, but Jari said that it was full-bodied and it was not true.
Jari said that she was mad at the record and asked for a song, but she finally finally found out about it - and that's right.
In June, the British each voted out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted in favour of the difference and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polling week's polls predict the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were alone in favour of staying in the EU.
Although a few researchers may have disagreed with the mainstream of their public administration, there was no such thing as a single research institution or university.
The basic concept of Western politics, the subject of the recent election campaign of former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", fell apart in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when they didn't hear their voice.
They collapsed when the economy did not seem to be the real thing about politics.
The economic conflicting language of the economy.
Continue for Macroeconomics tiva in its most recent monthly survey of trade answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists have not been heard, because this time the voters have taken a decision on non-economic grounds.
The explanation of the economic loss of one economists is not an economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of employees has been included in the number of employees, which is almost the same.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the way.
Many also have the impression that the value of the currency would be good; it is the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economic Committee, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of the economicists was not good enough.
They were given equal opportunities, especially for the BBC, in which only a few per cent of economic scientists supporting the EU's difference from economics to the majority of the majority in support of the economics.
The EU-obsessive vote was not interested in telling the opinion of the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capitals about the consequences of the difference.
New combinations of letters talked about the same thing as an economic activity, trade relations, debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were ignored because the economists represent bodies with which voters do not share common interests.
Of course, the academics of cities such as the economists would have stayed in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas was not working.
Immigration is a house.
The overwhelming profit of the Brexit vote was on immigration.
Immigrants will take your job, immigrants will push you to death, immigrants will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign workers in each of these collages.
How much work would there be to do if they left?
Each and every one of you in the waiting room can see where you are.
How much easier would it be for a British person to have a visitation period if they were not?
There are children in each school. There are children in each school.
How much easier would it be for the right British to get a job if they got rid of them?
Each municipality lives abroad.
I mean, how much more do you think they'd have in the first place if they left?
These are economic issues.
They concern employment, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond to them and if they did, their answers did not get any visibility.
The economists failed to explain that some of the British have more employment, fewer health centres and more money for money and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are the British general economy's non-profit-makers and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate reserve was Brecit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose investments in securities are based on the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, there was an early booking for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the EU-resolution camp, began to be reserved for just a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was a leave.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their money out of the market.
As a rule, the credit institutions do not have any kind of liquid assets, but they should now be required.
We're running out of cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25 % of the fund's investments in cash or in cash, old says Aberdeen's only open daily daily encumbrance from the real estate fund that was the subject of the news.
According to the old age, the average would be between 15 and 20.
The value of the money at that time was 9 billion pounds.
The total value of the corporate funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number of units of real estate in nine general, says Vanhanen, of all the real estate units in the United Kingdom.
considers that the lowest amount of cash in the funds was ten or even below it.
In other words, the funds reserved for Brecit in very different circumstances.
The funds closed down.
When the EU split-up camp won, Europe went away.
However, the few or two months following the vote on the market were very calm," Vanhanen says.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the talk by Mark Carney, Governor of the Central Bank, where he estimates that Brexit can be a major risk to a commercial trader.
The first of the households, Full Life, was frozen.
Together, these guys took over the main ends of the Financial Times and the BBC.
Things are happening immediately between 2007 and 2008, old says.
This caused investors to become nervous.
Institutional investors remained stronger, but private investors were nervous.
The ball seemed to spin, and the fund was now in the middle of the second round of the door.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the collected cash, but it may as well remain for the next few days as well.
According to the old man, they didn't really understand what they were thinking, but they did change the way things were going down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of business.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of it withdrew the notification.
Since then, it has been right, and now the market has been a couple of very calm, says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no correlation between Aberdeen's continental European funds and the European funds.
However, there was a lot to ask.
shouldn't be seen as an equal value to the non-residents.
In the old opinion, accounting for the trading of financial assets received disproportionate attention.
The open funds covered by the closures manage approximately four per cent of the UK real estate.
The Aberdeen lock-out lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors called off its investors this year for the fact that it may hold its assets for the next half of the year.
There is currently uncertainty in the weather, and economic growth forecasts have been reversed downwards, but the situation does not look "more important" for Aberdeen.
The most important issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors new opportunities, old points out.
The price of pounds and dollars is at least 30 years, while the market also has a 15% discount on sales at the time of the Brexit vote.
The dollarmaker can now buy up to 30 % of the value at a lower price.
There are a lot of good buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brext has brought sales to the London market for the London market.
At two o'clock, it didn't look much different yet.
On the 4th day that Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for investments in Asset Management in Aberdeen, a UK real estate company in Aberdeen, woke up again to review the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
Right there.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, Old says in another home in Helsinki.
Going to work right away.
London City was already alive despite the office.
The TV screens in the office, which were basically silent, were familiar with the news, and the loud crowd was very quiet when Mr. David Cameron came by to tell me the difference between the two of them.
When the market opened, the screenshots blinked red.
It was one who never believed in his life, says the Old One.
It is not true that, despite the appeal, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate companies in the United Kingdom, took place on the day following the Brexit vote, i.e. on the first day of the second trade.
The presence of the substance was a burden.
However, the mind was well prepared for the alternative, and that was the fact that it was in fact peaceful, Old story.
The Brexit vote started the transit process.
The man was followed by a storm.
It's a pound, it's a change of heart in Britain.
The markets were beginning to anticipate heavy invoices for the UK and, in particular, for the retail market in London.
In London offices, there were up to 20% mines expected in the coming years.
Soon the United Kingdom’s real estate companies began to ice one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the muck is gone, but there is still no doubt in the air.
It probably doesn't look like it's last summer vacation in the old age of Helsinki.
It is far too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference takes place and how Scotland reacts, for example.
The developments in the London real estate market have already been the first to come to light.
The information provided by CBRE by the SSS on price developments covers about one-third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the London City office building, 6.1 per cent of the total, the old list was 6.1 per cent.
The figures are not so over-crowded, but they are months of change.
The monthly index started in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All equal values took place for the period 2007-2008.
It is interesting, however, that Brexit was almost quickly hit by the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis on the United States market.
The old man believes that the comparison is not quite correct, as this is a British domestic crisis.
The atmosphere is another.
In the market, the market is not now seen as a whole, but as a result of the development of liquid assets, says Vanahanen.
There's always money.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us in any case.
In fact, the course of the transaction is not necessarily - it could have been in the front without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of London and other world-wide first-world real estate have already been too high.
For two years now, we have said that the House and the Houses are overpriced, says the Old One.
So the positivity was getting really high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the London population as well.
The second major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is becoming global, says Old One.
New entrants from the Middle East and Asia have come into the market, and more and more residents and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
It's an easy place to stay.
In addition, prices have been fed at the lowest level, which is why some employers have had to look for new sources of income.
This loan has been readily available - although, according to the old man, there is now much less than in the previous year.
Spread out, spread out.
In London, the misconception settled last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen began to lighten his holdings in London, and last year he was a salesman.
There was a possible change, and now it came.
What about from now on?
Depends on how the British economy is developing, old man says.
There's a lot he's afraid of coming up with, but he says that there's hardly a word he'll ever be allowed to do.
The climate suggests that there is a descending or a level playing field ahead of us.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, for he has been in real estate since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that the dome is understood by work.
If you are well prepared, you will be in a better position.
He believes in a far-reaching decomposition.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of it.
If the risk has been diluted, the risk is also decentralised, old says.
The S-group intends to register for more information on how to purchase.
The S-group knows what you're eating, as the Group of Directors has told us today that it is starting to provide more detailed information on the purchases made by its clients.
So far, after the data have been collected from a monthly sum, the last item at the beginning of this week will also be harmed by the products purchased.
The group will be here in Kesko, as the information purchased with the Plus Card has been collected in the Kesko User Register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been only positive.
Detailed information will be collected with the consent of the customer and used on an authorised basis for trade.
The most efficient channel is an email.
Quite a few customers have denied the use of product information, Aritala says to Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to the S-Group's integration change.
Kesko grades its client in ten chapters, according to mere purchases.
The classification is updated monthly.
The applicants are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they make.
The information is used for the purpose of targeted marketing for the customer.
Detailed purchase information is collected only from K-Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, will give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a client program and is not designed to do so at this time.
Finland's Middle-Easter Business has its own YÜKYSBOURUS customer programme, which can be joined in the selection houses, Sibo and Euromarkets.
At present, we do not currently have information on product or product-specific level, and we will remain at the same level as the final amount.
In other words, we know where the purchase was made and on the same day, as well as every receipt of the total.
We have not gone as far as the K-Group or the S-Group, Director-General of Business Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer programme will be renewed in the future, but the next item will be discussed.
However, Ora does not expect that the product information will be subject to the sale of data.
Start-up visitation
Sok's customer and customer register has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, the basis has included also professional, education, housing, and the birth years and previous personal data of the child.
Persons in the same household and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, balance and method of payment have been saved on the S-primary purchase.
In addition, information about the S-bonding partners has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product purchase information is beginning to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, information on S-markets, Prismojas, Kodin Terrois and ABC chains is currently recorded at product level.
For a long time, customers have had expectations that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjana Saarikoski, Head of Sok's Customer Owner and Partnering.
The S-group wants to inform its customers about the change.
They may prohibit the use of factual information for marketing purposes.
In any case, the data will be saved at the colleges, which is what it is, of course, not.
A candidate may check his or her data stored on the S-type website.
For example, cashiers do not have access to information, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila's kid is Customs's newest dog-stamping stand to be the first explosive dog in the world.
The Laboratory's puppy is bubbling hard at five similar branches of the same country lines at the Helsinki Airport airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a bottle of shells that were torching for the square gas.
The waste gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security and online trade access
They will be the first person in Customs to search for weapons and explosives and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The work may take Heila and Job, if necessary, to other border crossings and ports as well as to other ports.
However, the station will be Heila's main job, as the international security situation has changed in Europe due to serious terrorist attacks.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have been confirmed in Customs in the measures and after the attacks," says Customs Superintendent Mikko Grönberg.
Access to the training of the weapon and explosive charger in Customs is a transit mission through Helsinki Airport.
There are up to 40 million broadcasts per year through the increased internet trade at the airport, which may include foreign ordered weapons and explosives.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives in the Helsinki Airport, as well as their ingredients, out of a group of online shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo.
He'll be working all over Helsinki Airport.
It will examine registered baggage and mail.
In hundreds of centuries there will be great benefits when it can go through large containers and mark areas that require more research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of this report, Tuli will continue to test the weapon and explosive symptoms in the future.
Grönberg gives the idea a positive attitude.
Monday
The education of Heila-pennu is co-ordinated by the School of Customs, which is located in the Holy See.
Heila and I are also being trained by the Defence Forces.
There is strong experience with training dogs and explosives in the Defence Forces.
Customs, together with other matters, decides which smells Heila is taught to know.
They will be further trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Colleagues at the Airport are Customs's new drug dog, household and drug dog Mass.
Laborator Heila has been chosen from the kid's kid.
The criteria for the dog chosen for the home include tearing and hunting, as well as peace, because it is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives in the country, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a close partner.
No one gets home without the Viila, Suntio shows up.
The household claims go to Hela for the rest of the time.
The camera of the Illa-Sanomas makes a good dog with the camera's mike protection, but Heila will change the protection from the other side of the toy right away from the "irti" hand.
Work hard to get the job started.
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still peer tests in progress, the next October, where training is expected to be necessary for demanding tasks.
They can see jobs at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Passengers, unfortunately, cannot come here to iron out the work-cooking, press Suntio.
The cost of one job is about 60,000 EUR per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days may be longer, eight to ten hours, but each part of the job only lasts from one minute to two hours.
The owner of the work dogs is the common society in Customs.
Second, he applied for about 20-30 Customs legs.
Got hit by a Stopo that has never had a working dog before, but he has one of the dogs and a job of supervision at Customs.
The country became its first Olympic Games - the people get their day off.
Less than a million inhabitants of Fiji from the Olympics in Rugby are so highly valued in the country that the government has scheduled for the 22nd day of August.
According to the country's broadcaster, Fiji's government confirmed the outcome of the championship.
The day off is due to the return of the team the next day.
In their country of origin, refugees are also allowed to have a specialty in their own country.
Fijin Rugby Game is one of the first championships in the championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the finals in the capital of Suur, where the stadium had been screened.
Normally, only the native Fijians are excited about rugby, but this game united with our multilingual community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardin.
Dramaa in Rio - the Finnish farmer passed out after the storm went off.
The weight-weighter, Miko Tokola, succeeded at the last at a distance of 175 kg after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and literal feature for the promoter.
During or after the rises of the penalty, he has been fainted many times.
I don't really know how to say why.
Tokola was able to get 175 kilos of labour in Rio and 145 kilos of plaice in Rio.
The total result was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her job at least 175 kilos, as well as the other one.
In an attempt, the weights rose as a result of the loud screaming.
Until the court approved the lifting, the body was released under pressure.
The Finnish speaker is pleased that he has suffered from knee problems.
Prosan - Veikausliga - Illa-Sanomat - Ila-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which is playing in the football league, has concluded an agreement with Albert Prosa for the rest of the year.
We're looking for our team's lead player, who has powers and means to come to Finland and Rovaniemi with a small amount of money.
Over ten players and I went through a wealth of 55 players from all over the world.
Prosa, Coach of Rops, informed Juha Mainen, was able to stand out from the crowd as a good alternative.
Prosa, 25, arriving in Rop from the Tallinburg Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in the 109th quarter.
He has also been threatened by the Estonian national team.
Prosan is supposed to be with ROPS already on the back of the Seinajoki, where the Royals meet the Master SJK of the ruling Lord.
Ropis needed to be re-emerged when last year's secular king, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
Once again, the great Modern Church encounters: the teenage shorts are all about everything.
As Alex Dunphyna became familiar with the modern company comedy, Ariel Winter is once again showing up to look for her brave body.
In Hollywood, this is where the miniswitches were described, which do not make sense for imagination.
The Shorts revealed not only the player's legs but also this backside.
Winter, 18-year-old, has recently given notice to change his or her mind and conduct considerably more courageous.
The star has posed very little in the images published in common media and has taken many tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very few costumes.
Winter, the one who has come to the fore, has also recently published photos of itself.
If the picture is not shown, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked the first why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
The founder and CEO of WowomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was in the process of "typical Hollywood transformation" into a child star.
He's been on television almost all his life and he's grown up in the Cardassia period.
He has learned that what more appears to be the surface, the more public and attention Hollywood gets, the more Palmer says to Fox News, and more that exactly the same expression has been seen many times before.
The Talker started in the Modern Family series, which is only 11 years old.
The actor has pissed off some of his long-time fans by changing their image.
There's no idea where he's gonna be in ten years' time, when he's already doing it now, one of Winter's dead.
Some of the women fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and want to make no mistake about it.
You look sorry.
I don't care what the others do.
As an inspiration for many women, insinuating young woman.
Policemen from the Nordic countries prefer to go to Finland - tourists are attracted by a tear fire: In autumn it is possible to see a random murre aurora.
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese native air-refoulement trips from early autumn, Visit Finland will inform you on the announcement.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Finnish refoulement journey.
Revo fires are card cards on our winter journey and are closely linked to winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for the winter revontulum in the winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of bought-out trips.
It is rare to know that the revontuliseson begins from the early days and goes on to spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called myrror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the ripples, making the vision two times a coincidence, reports on the announcement of Visit Finland’s see President Anne Lin.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Revontulkamp is the early 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who are dreaming of villages and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
The tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, by online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from the University of Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among the Japanese in comparison with the rest of the Nordic countries.
However, the Americans would like to see more unique attractions from Finland, and this revont fire, according to Lindi, has an enormous power.
In Finland, the number of foreign tourists snoring has clearly increased more than in other Nordic countries.
The following year, in Finland, they hung over two times more than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Citizens are an interesting target group for the Finnish population, as they spend more than 80 million in Finland.
The average number of Japanese visitors in Finland was $188 a day,” says Lind.
The UK will be satisfied with the Rugby-George-Silver as the competitions organised by Fidi turn to gold.
The United Kingdom's progress in the Rugby tournament ran out of the final challenge for Fiji at the Thursday night final, when the team experienced the 43-37 crush on Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji held a round of interviews, breakouts, pretzels, support game, runlines and in the dark when he won the gold - their first Olympics - their first Olympics.
The section was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third day of Britain - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic Rugby opening tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The semi-final, played on the same day, of 7-5 stars from South America, could have bothered them in the finals.
Nevertheless, Fidi would have won up to 15 high-end teams in this situation.
Great Britain may - but probably not - be comforted by the fact that at least one British has a ten-inch gold medal on its neck: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, a former workman from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has been a long way to go.
Eight years ago, as coached by He Ryan, every game lost in the Adelaide tournament.
Here they just lost one.
This confusion happens, but development is shocking.
Fidi began to reject the United Kingdom’s tariff codes very well for interest.
To Tom Mitchell, with his team, this was like they were running mobile buses, and the worlds came in 5-0 after Osea Kolinsai dived at an angle to the target area.
When it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown at the right edge led to a ball shot.
12.0 and the United Kingdom had barely touched the ball.
Mill's brilliant tattage stopped the man-mount Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it was only slow for Fid.
At seven minutes Jasa Vermalua was working on the right corner of the goal, and the United Kingdom was 17-00.
Nakarawa again made the goal of the new beginning, and the clock was still at the top of the minute.
Vatemo Ravouvou then went through the United Kingdom to find out how to do the math and went to the line to make the goal.
After the earthquake, the situation on the break was 29-0.
It seemed like Fidi was a full-blown rugby, while the United Kingdom was just talking about the game.
That's the thing. That's the thing.
In the meantime, the United Kingdom made the most recent changes, which blocked the Fid dam... for a total of four minutes, which was well compared to the first half of the year, until Josto Tuisko scored the goal after Fid's pitching game.
Danton caught a goal for the United Kingdom at a close corner of touchdown and narrowing it down to numbers 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the North Sea islands, whose supporters sang, swinged flags and played in the audiences.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
The last time we reached Mata Vilime, there was an overlay in Fidi's cake that didn't need to be peeled.
The party was spoken, the Fudis hugged and the United Kingdom fell to the grass, completely swept up.
On the same day Fidi had hit Japan in the semi-finals 20-5, and the United Kingdom won South Africa in the strong semi-finals, where each scored one goal - the UK scored the game.
Brown took the lead in South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with a dazzling piece of work and made a goal under the finish line at the end of the finish line.
The most important guarantee from Marcus Watson, a team of 15-asside-rugbys from Anthony's brother, ensured victory and finally a silver medal.
The battle against cancer led to the war victory of Helen Glover and Heather Stanning.
In these games, there will be no more feeling than that, and it really means something.
The first bet to the last, 220 hard drives towards the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning from the golden moment Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they had a two-way row, there were three months in the fit. Coach Robin Williams's all-round was present all the time when the two had a second consecutive one in each other's two-way Olympics - the first in British sports history books that excel such a achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance unbeatable, which is also a record record.
This, what we see, is two great athletes, who are at the top of the surface of the jockey, not entirely a reflection of the win-win nature.
There is a group of helpful handsets behind each chord that are working on things that matter, and none of these hands were as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, knew if he would live to this point.
He said, the situation was impertinent.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It would be pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was that his treatment was able to begin in the first half of 2014, during which period they created as little interference as possible - if that expression can be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to go fast.
It's just me.
I was down and I was walking around Sections 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that one thing was enough.
It saw.
The war itself is a long way, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the win, a couple of thoughts were Williams, who had been nervous, and he was perfect with his own mind.
Stanning, who was in command of Afghanistan, had a royal crush on the regiment, said: "I've been in a Tunnel this time, which may be a little overreact, but this means so much to me."
It only emphasizes that it is me, me and Helen, and also Robin, we have worked.
The past three years have been great.
We wouldn't be nothing, so I'd like to thank you very much, he's the world's best coach.
I couldn't have imagined a better trainee or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Heather Starting have not lost their competition for five years.
Pari set a severe rhythm that his competitors did not think of.
Even at the last 500 metres, as the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in storage.
We were very close at the moment.

ETSK's Pahtane Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside of the forest owners.
The forest gift is one of the tax havens of the Ministry of Finance in the next year's draft budget.
It is proposed that the income tax Act should be subject to a tax which would be granted on the basis of a change in forest change gift.
In the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest supply has four objectives: to promote changes in the generation of forest holdings, to improve the housing structure of young forest owners, to increase the size of the forest and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner will make a reduction in the pure income of the forestry sector.
Of course, the idea of making such a tool for developing cycle changes in forestry is good, commenting on the Central Market (MTK) of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MK) Director-General Juha Vagyrainen.
However, it is difficult to find a critical proposal for a tax change.
The balance of the forest is to be charged with the pure income of the forest owner.
It's full income, it's all gone.
In the opinion of the JRC and the Jäärajas, the effectiveness of tax reduction would be greater if a reduction could be made in clear terms of the result of the sale of wood.
The VM's proposal starts by preventing the net result of forestry from achieving a clear return on income from forestry, which should be deducted from other taxes.
A person would benefit from tax, who would not be missing any of the things.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is not able to visualize it, says Jajarainen.
The point is, according to him, only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit for forest value is set at EUR 40 000.
It's too high for Pääras.
In such a way, 82% of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the least-favoured circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10 % of the forest owner, he says.
In VM, it is considered that the border pursues the objective of buying the order.
In forest forestry, forest management has been taken for decades, according to Pähärinen.
Against this background is the ageing of forest ownership.
According to the JRC, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are living.
The powerful raving surprises the drivers at Himanga - two cars went up into the ditch and ran into each other.
There was a special attack on the Kalajoki Himanga the next afternoon.
According to the government, two consecutive times the car was re-quieted into the ditch, after which the rear came after the previous driver.
According to Päipäjö's minister, Mr. Harri Päytä, there is no doubt that the process of re-entry into the ditch is due to a strong coup.
In this time, there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information on their injuries.
The driver of the driving car did not hurt the driver.
Accident occurred on the highway from 8 Spirita to a few kilometers from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer medicines.
Recent research results by researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer medicine even more effectively.
The findings made by Professor Johanna Ivaska in the study group indicate that the incidence of cancer in cancer increases the malignant nature of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and the cells of the tissue grow in the same way as in this environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by causing the cancer’s surrounding tissue to return to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effect of anticancer medicinal products may be enhanced by focusing on the interaction between the cell and the active tissue.
The results have been published in the 4th September cell biology-rated Nature Communities magazine.
The provocation of home death is still under way in the court, the prosecution is also asking for a murder conviction for another perpetrator.
The promotion of home death in the court is complete in both cases.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for domestic death in Muhoks.
For the second 8 years, he received 4 months, among other things, from a young person’s murder and gross murder.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for the murder and brutal murder of a person.
The convicted person was also convicted of serious road safety threats as a young person and of the right to drive a vehicle as a young person.
The Court of Justice was elected by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who received the last judgment.
The prosecution is asking for a lighter sentence of 12 years of imprisonment for the murder of a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence.
They were in the process of being fully understood.
According to the Court of Justice, 17-year-old young people killed a school child protection unit manager last January.
The 17-year-old, who had been attacked by a conviction, claimed to be behind the living room on the couch, sat at the manager's door.
The director had the right to take off and tossed the young one into his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum cleaner.
The director was also, among other things, strangled with leadership, punch and kick in the head.
According to the mindset, both judges were fully understood at the time of their action.
According to the court, young people were planning to escape from home at least from the first day of the day.
Ice is the longest in the world’s long-lived, with an increase in ice at the age of only 15 years.
For the most extreme life, icefish is confirmed, reports Science magazine recent research.

The female growth rate is only 15 years of age.
It's only a centimeter a year.
Only one shellfish is known to live longer than the sharks.
The researchers discovered the age by radio interference.
Due to the nuclear tests carried out in the 21st century, some sharks had radioactive residues.
On the basis of this, the researchers were able to assess the life of the sharks.
It is estimated that 392 years for the oldest tossed or the second tossed could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Agenda - News
Donald Trump's world does not change today.
Up to one third of all tax revenue would be missed if a change in corporation tax was introduced by Donald Trumpin.
Incomes would also be reduced, in particular, by the least useful tax incentives.
Trump described his tax programme as a revolutionary presentation in Detroit on Monday.
The corporation tax fell from 35% to 15%.
Not to raise a really high sum, 1,000 billion dollars a year.
The total income tax rate is now 39,6, after the sale of the real tax 33.
The inheritance tax will be abolished in full.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of the economy and of bankruptcy of small businesses.
The main environmental standards laid down by pipelines must be re-established and energy regulation must be strengthened.
Mr. Barack Obama's capital reform is to be re-examined.
The management must be appointed "experts instead of red tape".
According to Trumig, "damaged" trade policy is one of the most important reasons for the United States of America.
The free trade agreement should not be used.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty duty of 45% and 35% of Mexico.

On the contrary, Trump truthfully went through the talk written by the helpers, even though the well-founded protesters interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, will see Trump taking him to some sort of economic recession.

Attack wave from the past - News News
The sea is fatal, but the actual wave of attacks strikes the middle of Madrid's street tip - accounting with the past can start.
It summarises the story of Pedro Almodovar's new story.
Almodovar's previous job as a tour manager was a fun and rustic satirical comedy, which is also the skin where I'm going to go on a career in the ê í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í .
It is also Juliet (2016) who is located somewhere between those two works.
It is an amicable seismic, human, and family drama with a mother-to-daughter relationship at the heart of it.
The story is a simple game, and we're seeing a great deal of a long-term setback.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
A new man (Dario Grandinet) in the last few days of a casual encounter may always be a miracle to the end of the world.
In the form of a back and a second letter, the last time the phases of the marriage grew up again.
It starts before the day of birth, from the moment when this day came (Daniel Grao).
In the second female section, Julieta, as a young teacher, presents Adraina Ugette, from the series Ommelten (2013-2014).
Ageing has been handled in a way that can be considered a bonnet, but I myself would say that it's time for a simple-to-tunnel and a simple-tunnel-to-tunnel.
For Almodóvar films, it is always fair to say that the distance to the humour of the sublime of Vieta is always fair.
It is a smooth play, quiet, placeful of good music and a very mindful film, in which there are elements of electricity in it.
On the other hand, the typical visual selection of the co-director is preserved and so that it begins to give a little bit more thought to itself as a pure shapeance than a functional, artificial way of doing things.
Diseases, deaths or otherwise just sudden loss of life that are trying on people in the film, but are still the same thing.
This applies in particular to the dress: in the case of a name-named person, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to the displayed baskets.
Almodóvar is aware of this, but the main thing, i.e. the sentences of each scene, is not much better than that.
In mechanical times, the impression is external and unsouled.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript from Nobella 2013 award-winning Canadian Alice Munron based on three novels.
←it has been published in the book Hero: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a somewhat common-sex written literature filming.
The facts would have been emotionally inextricably inextricably intense for even more reason, as much of the great things - especially the blatant guilt - the subject of the film deal with the subject matter.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Zenro Alice.
Main features: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
known as the “Employment Party” - News
No new copies will be made, daring ministers, so that the basic Finns do not completely collapse.
However, in the spring, the final operations will be done at the bulk store.
No new copies will be available.
The already decided fourth savings are sufficient.
This is how the Prime Minister, Juha Sipilä (medium) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (co.) are assured under the budget line.
In fact, it is true that there are no new treatments for VM's head, as social security cuts were decided in the spring context.
A cut of 0.8% is made in the paper, the public sector, the basic security of unemployment and almost all other interests linked to the public accounts.
The duration of employment security is reduced from 500 to 400.
The training sessions are ongoing.
Plastics are haunted.
Is it true that we are not doing new practices?
This is the first year of the year.
Kunicalas are held in July and are the most important febrile meter of the day, not the galleys.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the local government's various political parties have been ruining the public's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallars indicate that the government's basic Finns are waiting for the loss of the rickets, although the result of its first elections was modest at 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new councillors, most of which next spring the price of influence in the real estate government will be realised.
The lifeline of the three about the same size as the three governments is based on the fact that the population of the basic Finns endures.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters have had enough of the government during the first year.
The first important points of the party parliamentary group's visit have also come to light.
First of all, the new replicas will not come -rectories will be puzzled by the fact that next year they will be carried out sharply and, secondly, will be used to soften the expected impact of the basic Finns.
How big was 2018?
The second of all is, in fact, the other way around if the Sipillon regime is still in operation.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness this afternoon, but the budget proposal for Petter Orpo will be set at EUR 5.9 billion next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the election, there are two options for you to choose from.
The first is to raise your hand in the middle of the day and admit that you are unable to comply with your own law: debt does not win or even slow down.
Another one's holding on to the program.
This means that the past is getting even tougher in the 2017 budget period.
The budget would be at least close to balance during 2018 and then spring will be held in the parliamentary elections against what will happen.
Such activities did not allow for any indebtedness.
It is very clear that in the current activities indebtedness will not work, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to create a positive atmosphere.
In the information conference of the Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen budget, the curves used by the Secretary-General to prove it in opposition to:
The growth projections of the global economy have once again proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not yet risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy in the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% this year and has increased from the average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Employment is now higher in the year.
On a weekly basis, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-term of next year.
is responsible?
On the day of October 2015, the Court of First Instance rejected the Commission's decision, which was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment next year will cost around EUR 3 billion, which is actually covered by the new debt.
This is a central, assembly and basic Finnish idea of what is responsible.
Question: When you want to leave a lot of work to do.
Four of them believe that the organisation of day-care, work and physical activities of the child are the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the study conducted by the Two Municipal Development Foundation (KOKS).
The majority of the people also hold a responsibility to a single municipality for books, culture, citizenship, building supervision, university education and waste management.
In turn, the responsibility of the county is more clearly known as county planning, specialist care, vocational education, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institution for the development of the disabled.
None of the tasks performed by the municipalities in line with the law are intended to be transferred to the State.

The fluctuation is determined in the rain cloud when the rainwater and its weight are driven by a falling airflow.
The changes in the condition of the wet-pillar water bind to heat, and therefore the falling air cools and its speeds towards the earth are accelerating.
The Atmospheric Science Department is informed that the current flows occur during the summer.
The path of the encyclopedia flows is just a sign.
The disappearing flow struck the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum, as the location of Parafest, this afternoon before five o’clock.

Smells of aging air conditions in London
According to the survey, the skin of the lontos is older than usual.
It's air pollution.
The British study is presented by Eveninging Standard.
The smart home care company Caci introduced London air into the most toxic small particles and their fat.
The results show that many people in life are two and a half years old than those living in rural areas.
Aged small particles of skin are very high dust, which originates from the transport of fuel.
The same components also cause vital disorders that, according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 lotomas die each year.
The studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the ultimate layer of the body.
Cacin’s investigation found that early ageing is a risk especially for those who are walking on their way to work in the vicinity of busy streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example by wearing a variety of masks, but regular cleaning is recommended for a more detailed decision.

After he got out of the tractor and went past it, the brakes of the tractor threw and the tractor poured on the man.
He did not fall under it, but, however, he was chasing the same man to the extent that he was transported to the central hospital in serious harm to the follow-up investigations.
The tractor didn't want to go any further than that, as it affected the stones that were in front of it.

The top mind is too big a toy shirt, the knee-caps on the ankles, and the high soundings and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the sports club was a community where everyone was in each other's ways.
The single spirit created an environment where there was fun playing.
All of you were very busy - the teammate's father trained us and our father was with you.

The weekly presence of Kouvola in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasulle's familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for work will be expected.

In 46 we started building a driveway, and the bank had not even been concerned about it at first.
However, I myself had the courage to join the project and have been fully involved, Mr. Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the pure Finnish food production and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Mr. Koli, who is building trucks, is to invest in his even bigger craft.
The work has been successful, since Koli is the top 10 in the Maasure Future magazine in the young food producer competition.
Right now, he's competing for any profit he can make.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
In the first eight months of the month, Bulgaria reports the inflation for the first time.
Statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest in the last years (after June 2012) and the first in the second month after the last year, when a positive 0.2% was announced.
The average annual inflation, measured by the life cost index, was -0.8 % over the last 12 months (August 2015 - June 2016), compared to the corresponding 12-month period (August 2014 - June 2015).
On July 2016, the life-cycle index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
In the beginning of the month (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the cyclical rate has been -0.2%, and annual GDP in February 2016 was -0.2% in June 2015.
Compared to the previous month, there was no increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in food and footwear (2.2%), furniture, food and routine care (0.0%), health (0.1%).
The prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcohol and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, transport and education.
The "anime" effect of Snapchatin is considered to be an Asian caricature type.
According to Snapchat, the name has acted as an inspiration for the filter, but according to some observers, it is racist.
With its Lens tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million more all over the world to shape the reality and play the perfect game in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You may want to change yourself into an anaesthetic, anaesthetic, or a character that would be in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lentils are simple, externally rotary tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfie daily.
All misleading steps will quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have previously been criticised for attacking the fact that the app is promoting a blackface or "mama" mask or prefers a bleached color as a beauty mask.
So when Snapchat was admiring some of the users of the lentils that gave them wild eyes, violet teeth and naked cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature from Asian people - "beautiful" or "yellowface".
And they wonder if these repeated non-Seconds are an example of the major problem facing diversity.
News and disdain spread widely on Wednesday with the reports of The Verge and Motherboard, one day later Snapchat said that it had ceased its function.
The third explanation: Lens was meant to be a tribute to anonymists, not a cup of Asians.
But for an observer who experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes of operation.
Some of the others denied the comparison of the absolutions in a keen manner.
Grace Sparani, a Korean-American art student with a wide range of tweet photos and photos, said in his post that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
added that "it's hard to argue against the comparison, which has the closest gross Asian caramel and the filter's effects".
It shows that the filter is not only a sterling, it is a kering, it is an extraordinarily evading, it is being exported.
Snapchat is not a company that crosses these cultural traps.
The American culture seems to be stuck in a endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and equipment that we all support in our hands.
The vast, racially more diverse public population of Nanapchat can mean that they are more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that offends the user, "it is much easier for these people to be invisible".
Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urge others to do the same.
In his paper to the Media and in his phone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity in the methods of remuneration for Snapchat.
Zhu criticised the company mainly as a white man and wrote his papers on hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#PooSnapchat)
" Either they do not have a diverse representation of different colour colors in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions," said Zhu, a Chinese-American, "or they have representatives of different colors, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or can speak plainly."
Other observers are arguing with him, a complaint that Snapchat has largely failed to reply to.
The European Parliament and the Council, on the one hand, and the European Parliament, on the other, and the Council, on the other hand.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to ask about the racial background of his staff, but according to the representative, he recently hired the recruiter to focus on the under-represented populations and to promote internal integration.
On the other hand, Mr Zhu said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed, adding: "It is that they actually support more of us in order to say that this is not a good thing."
According to the Congress panel, the military officer was wrong about the Isis inquiry.
In a report published on Thursday, the British Panel said that the United States of America had developed intelligence reports from the headquarters of the United States Armed Forces branch to provide a more optimistic picture of the war on the Isis in Iraq and Syria, as was the case with what happened on the ground.
The interim report of the working group, which was set up by the President of the Republican Committee on Defence of the Representative Room, the questionnaire and the Sub-Committee on Human Resources, found in a report entitled "Unsatisfaction with the widespread spread" among headquarters's intelligence analysts, who said that the presidents were covering their estimates of the US's efforts to win the Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcomina, is the General Assembly of the Armed Forces in the Florida Tampa, which operates the US armed forces in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence outputs of high-value Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than the facts of the on-the-spot situation, which were normally more positive than the analysis of other factors in the intelligence community," said the press release.
"Centcom's events are impossible to accept - in the war of our fighters, you will support when poor analyses are presented to high-quality decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, President of the Republic of the Republic of the United States, ".
Centcom's status failures are right up to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems in the description of the HQ and analyses of the United States' efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
It does not provide any clear evidence that the high-level administrators of Obama's administration would have identified cases as a cover-up, it describes the knowledge of the inspectors, such as the Directors of Centcom would have put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic state, Isissi, in a more secure light.
"For the first half of 2015, many major press releases, statements and proofs were much more positive than you did," said the report.
For example, Centcom’s authority publicly stated that a major attack to take back the Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in the hands of the Fathers.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mike Pompeo, the United Republic of America, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence officers at the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces Division in the United States of America, undernearly, manipulating the outputs of the HQ in the Isis.
After hearing from the task force, the Republicans opened up the task force that the analysts had raised concerns that information about the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by a large-scale study of the results.
An additional, ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence has been initiated by the Ministry of Defence's Chief Inspector.
On Thursday, the members of the Committee of Inquiry of the Parliamentary Room were briefing on their own findings, which were consistent with the conclusions of some of the Republican Labour Forces.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an isolated process for the intelligence evaluation of Isis and the Iraqi security forces," said Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the Committee, in an opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of the results of the survey", upset the mood for analysts and "did not give enough space for different views".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find any evidence that the House would be under pressure from Centcom's analysts to fit their conclusions "in a predetermined or political story".
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday on the preliminary findings of the FBI investigation.
Last time The New York Times reports that the Pentagon inspector has begun an investigation following the appeals of Centcom's analysts.
Secretary-General Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said in his opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the report as long as an inspector's investigation is ongoing.
He said that "experts disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the Community and the Ministry of Defence are maintaining a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
There are more consequences than just what comes to the question of whether the US-led bombing operations in Egypt and Syria are simple (as is now claimed by the growing number of defence authorities).
Last year's history questioned the extent to which President Obama can rely on the honest valuations of Iraq, Afghanistan, Thailand and other situations of crisis to be carried out by the headquarters.
For over a decade ago, the question of the state of the state is being debated by the fact that Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper in which it was said that despite a number of objections from the analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in the context and had a very short time to see what the consequences would have for the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on Islamic state information.
According to the authorities, last year Hooker's group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strikes against the refineries of the Islamic state had not really affected the economy, because it had created temporary processors to make a public exchange.
The Times report in the event that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters, however.
The bridge commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to criticise last year after many legislators gave him proof of war as an over-report of war.
General Austin retired in July, and his place at headquarters came General Joseph L. Votel.
The second is the second consecutive one in the maahockey of the country, with an interim discussion with the United Kingdom.
The day after he had made three goals for the team when he won the Japanese 6-1, Katie Bam made the United States of America for the ground hockey team on Thursday, two thirds for the Indians for the three thousand.
Five goals in two games speak of unforgettable arrival, but Bam, aged 27, said that he was not sure if he had ever done the same thing before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the one who keeps a book about his paintings."
But this he knows: the Americans are in a 4-0 situation in the Olympics tournament and they share with the first place in the United Kingdom, which was still unbeatable after winning the United States 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will be faced with the final game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams are in the middle of the quarter, and this game plays, who is the first and the second player in the sixth team in their group.
First established again at the start of a strong Dutch, the first president, a little longer quarter finals.
Whatever game it is, those who have come up with a surprising encounter here, four years after they were left in the Olympics in London, the second of the 12 teams in the 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He went into Pennsylvania at the University of Bell and picked up his land-breaker for the first time at the age of 3 (his other twins played game in Drexel) at the age of 16 when he became its youngest.
was not involved in the 2008 Olympics because they did not participate in the final list of players.
In 2012, nothing worked for him and his teammates.
The following year, Craig Parnham, the only one, was appointed as a coach, and things are going to change.
"A change of heart, change of mind, physical change", Bam said.
We didn't have the same pace of work in London as we do now.
We have made a complete translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the goal in a crossroads close to the goal.
One had come into the air with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and held in 1-0 readings until the end of the round, when Bam was in control.
Drives the ball on the left side of the field, then spins in the middle and a small ball in the finishes, taking the balls to 2-0.
Ms Gonzalez added a fourth in the middle of the third half.
This game was the first game of the tournament for the first US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had scored one of each of the first three winnings.
Good for you. Good for you.
So is Bam.
"We've got a good time," Parnham said, but it's good luck with the game.
Trampoliin's peace is among the most Olympic people in the world.
Wherever you are, whatever time is, the Olympics are on.
Rio dei’s events seem to be persistent and inevitable, to the point of fierce competition and effort.
It's like the Olympics themselves are a flaming message cable conveyed from the firefighter to the swimmer and gymnast to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, to read a newspaper or to write a conversation with a fellow member in the shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or hatred between Michael Pups and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the Olympics, the next and future spirit-smelling solituded, could indeed be one of the names known to all who are open to the best viewing time and who are in favour of sponsorship of sponsorship agreements and good mind TV commercials - if he were a grower, a gymnastics or even a swordsman.
Dooley, 28 from the Great Lake Forest, competes in the Olympics in the trampoline.
Olympics do not shed light on all species alike.
Farthest from the center, partly in the shadows, are the species that are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, string shooting, badminton, badminton, taekwondo.
We're always in the middle of a swim, for as long as it doesn't last.
But if I may make a small number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to the secluded charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been at the Olympic Games since 2000, when it first played its role in the Sydney Games, it has been in the middle of 16 years so little to notice that many of the people I've been looking at did not realize that it was an Olympic nature at all.
This can be a regional ignorance.
At the very least, the United States has sent athletes to compete in the race, it has never won in it, and its athlete has not advanced until the finals until 2012.
Chinese and Russians generally share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, China Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie McLennan are defending London's gold medals.
However, there is a certain appeal to trampoline, mainly because it is better suited to clown school than to both fields for uncivilized replacements.
In this respect, I must recognise that I am not an expert, I am just a fan of Airworthiness.
The laws offer opportunities for fun, such as to notice the colour of the endless bounces of cartoons, but it also has the pompousness of gymnastics and swimming, the two species that are going to become part of it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the word el trampolín, which means a push-up platform.
The Master's goal is to jump nearly 30 feet high on a key trampoline, and they have to perform lively business series (translations, skills and volts) and finally fall on their feet.
According to official Olympics, it will be assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and "flight time".
There are 32 athletes competing in Rio from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic direction is moving forward.
Medals must go further, closer, higher and higher - sometimes to the finish point, sometimes at a time around the field.
They are not only hunting a goalline or a starting wall, but also, in television news, another sneezeing border: a world or an Olympic record.
This determined goal is noble, admirable and even phanate - and can even get the viewer to tears.
But it is also the reason why looking at cats can be a bit exhausting, too.
I'm gonna have to get you some rest from here.
The Trampolitin movement is up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The contestant rises to the new story, making it seem like an astrologer, going up, then coming up, then coming up, then being effortlessly up again.
There is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during this period there is no frantic rush towards the end, no leaps into the distance, only the dream of time and power, a thawing interruption.
It's as close as the state of mind as it can be in the Olympics.
The women’s competitions and then the finals will be held the afternoon after the launch of the broadcast at 13 a.m. (ET), while the races will also be here on Saturday at 13 a.m.
NBC will send the finals as part of the afternoon at least 14 a.m. on each day.
In the midst of the Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, charming moment, which I think most likely will not be noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is only achieved by providing male athletes with an eye-to-eye and a mind-to-mouth (such as the United States of America's formerly proposed by the The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his new fandom to look after.
"A generation of people to speak their mind" in Ethiopia, which is a long-standing ally of the United States of America.
Violent protests in Ethiopia.
Political change in Ethiopia has been the subject of violent opposition by protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters have been shot dead in conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia in the mood?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong West Federation, the economy of which is growing again and again.
In the last month, however, protests against government have been shaking the country to an increasing number of countries.
In the last tens of thousands of people rushed to the streets, demanding profound change.
According to the rights of data subjects, the answer to the question was insolent.
The witnesses said that the police shot and killed ten unarmed protestors.
The letters, the videos of the demonstrations, which are supposed to be last year before or this year, show how they will be able to beat young people while they are being forced to stand up against the wall.
The United Nations Supreme Court is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to hold this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group research.
Ethiopia is, after Nigeria, the second wealthiest country in Africa, and the Western worlds recognize it.
Migration and intelligence are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and most likely the country of America will receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an active pace.
Its infrastructure has come to an extremely large extent, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new city for business travellers.
Street streets are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy; human rights organisations have repeatedly spoken about the repression of the government, the country's opposition has been limited, and the dissidents have been silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven long distances to the desert.
This could be changing.
"If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to express themselves, this will happen," says Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
I think I'm going to make myself feel better.
The generation is in a state of mind.
The complaints are diverse and comprehensive in the power of the entire land-use coalition.
After much of the last year's election, the ruling party and its allies got hold of each opposition, and now it has all the seats in Parliament.
That means that the barriers to Eritrea at the opposite border are weak, and this tight and controversial line of action calls for hundreds of months in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, who have recently been more or less defeated, can use and reassemble.
Numerous factors indicate why, after many years of submergement, bitter emotions are now about to explode.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: the smartphone.
Over the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through the media, as many smartphones have become more common and the Internet service has been closed.
If you were to shut down access to the Internet and information, as it often does, especially during the demonstrations, people can communicate with you through the hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
The two largest ethnic groups of Ethiopia, oroms and amharas, will come to a better conclusion.
Oroms and amphes are not natural allies.
For a long time, Amharas, who come mainly from other highlands in Ethiopia, have succeeded in politics and in their activities by using orphans, many of whom are Muslims and who live in recessions.
This, too, is changing.
"We are on our way to a single umbrella," said Orom leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The most important demonstrations have been Amhara and Oromo regions.
Many Amharas and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unlikely to be a member of the Tigre people, covering about half of the population and ruling arms, press service, trade and politics.
The third reason for the restlessness is the loss of Meles Zenawin.
Meles, former chief of the rebel, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a sticky genius, the man who saw around the corner.
Analysts say that he was very good at realizing the early signs of dissatisfaction and using the secret messengers to make the opponents harmless.
"The current administration does not have such a basic instinct," says Abdi, Convergence Analyst.
Ethiopia's new name, Hailemariam Desaleg, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Just like Meles, which was from the tigre region of North Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that security services managed by the Tigra are not trusted by him.
They believe that this can lead to increased bleeding.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in the midst of such an upheaval in 2005, when thousands of people protested about the elections that, according to the analysts, seemed to be the first to be being hurried by the party and then hit them.
In the next strike, many protesters died, each less than in the last few months, and the period of resting went by relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their views on infrastructure planning, such as the new business train, and for their major progress in the battle against poverty.
Obviously, this has not dictated an internal transformation of the hatred of the Ethiopian government.
And now it's going to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Amhara City Gondari attacked the Tigra-owned companies, and tigra-extreme hatred will become increasingly common in the media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and the rest of the United States and the rest of the United States into clumsy.
The United States has moved to Ethiopia as a base for air services to a third country in Somalia, although the latter has recently closed down this base.
Today, the countries of the Western world want to support democracy, and they do not want to collapse their alliances in an unstable region, as they already do.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balance."
Donald Trump uses Obama-based-Isis-based claim to be "friendliness".
Donald J. Trump tried to stifle the last of his campaigns in the second half of the day, arguing that he was not serious when he was this month on a number of occasions inspired that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the founders of the Islamic National Assembly group "founders".
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate with the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have been hard-pressed to defend him during the busy period, in a position where he must explain the comments he does not necessarily want to make.
After the suggestion made at the Summit on Wednesday evening, Trump is still more and more excited about Thursday’s interviews, where he was moved that he really meant to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
However, in early morning's Twitter release, Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The report was complete from the last day Trump said that he was really serious about the attack in several interviews.
When Conservative broadcaster Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumps to ease his remarks, reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Isis, the President of the Republican Republic, in their ears to hear this.
The last one comes in a situation in which Trump has again sought to focus his campaign on the results of the opinion polling on the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy in Michigan.
Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Once again, he warned that Clinton's efforts would result in higher taxes, and that he said that he was boring.
Trump has been the most powerful anti-terrorist defence in the past.
Late in July, after he met with a wide-ranging review apparently when he suggested that I should hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his comments with the words "of course I am sarcastic".
The approach allows Trump to speak within the limits of the word and then return as soon as necessary.
"I think it's a model where he's testing certain messages that are important to his fans. He's looking at how they work, and then he's 'explicating', depending on what they're doing," said Ruth Kõrman, a communication expert who's followed the language of both candidates.
I also think he's funny about his statements and knows that they're sufficiently vague to be filtered through many different lenses.
Instead of lightening his speech for a large polling audience, Trump has been more and more captivated in the last few days when his favor has gone on to bill.
A new, published NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey showed that Trump is going to lay down Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tough in Florida.
While Trump is mainly trying to avoid asking questions about provocative matters, he often accuses his critics of misconception of his words or of misunderstanding of his sense of humor.
As he faces closer and closer examination of the presidential election over the last few months, Trump's jokes have forced his faithful allies into an awkward position, where public support must be provided regardless of how provocative his comments are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most important supporters of Trump, saw great pain in supporting the candidate CNN's interview on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real, random comments in his word," said Giuliani, when he first asked about the truth about Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, the organization he called the fourth was completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled people out of the way.
The most recent Power Republicans are trying to claim that the Obama Government, where Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, lets the father become worse because it failed to deal effectively with the present situation in the Middle East.
A few meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued to be aware of the attack on the news, which are against him in every word and are in opposition to him.
He mocked the question of "mads, pathetics" who were trying to get out of me, saying, "They're not succeeding!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as evidence that he was unfit for being elected.
Formerly a joint workshop going back to Greenie.
Verb Cafe was a limp, just a cash-per-view place in Williamsburg, where there wasn't a wired machine, but who had a good cup of coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, Bedford Avenue street was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verb in June 2014, Soap Cherie, sells a cup of cake-shaped soap.
It was the last loss of the people in the medium-term reorganising city.
Artist Molly Crabapple is well-known: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a retailer."
But if New York is a change, it is also a re-invention.
The Revised Verb opened up last month to Greenpoint, below the top of its original position.
The new verb has a wi-fi and it can pay with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same impeccable atmosphere.
We're still good at that, too.
The new verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old coffee shop, who is the owner and owner of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001, and he was there all the way.
When the customer offered money in a new place, he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same way.
verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso machine.
It even used old verb lights.
Royal Rodriguez said that he also wanted to see him.
He's got a new personality.
There are bacon eggs and cheese sandwiches on the list and there are, for example, cabbages and brown onions on the covers.
There's brown rice in the back.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
For a period of nine months, Rodriguez says that he notices a steady flow of old business customers.
"Williamspel also paid too much to many former customers," he said.
One of the most recent days, Rebecca Oliveira was one of the other users.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited verb regularly.
After he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the coffee shop.
He says that after Verb's invasion, he gave up drinking for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's food and culture," he said.
Now he's back in a cup of tea, each day he ordered a chai drink instead of his ice cup, which is one new addition.
Tom Rosenthal, a long-term client, visited Verb with confidence since 2003.
He used to work there before and always made the same order.
"Every day of fifteen more than seven, just like the clock, I went in and they were making spices with my bagel butter," he said.
The picture. Rodriguez said that he wanted to make experiments and bring new dishes to the meal.
Now Rosenthal is still making the actual order, but sometimes because of the change he has the status of a tasty bagel with bacon, egg and butter.
Rodriguez says that he does not take any offense at the booty store that took hold of the premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherien offered to make Verb a special soup in which they used coffee, which was cooled, as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish citizens of Greenpoint have also approved a cafe.
One of these new users turned the menu upside down, and Rodriguez said that he was about to set it up at some point to make him feel welcome again.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice shop wants a bottle and cooled coffee.
There is a possibility that the collage will spread to the next door.
For many customers, it is enough for them to get old promotions in their new verb.
Joseph Whitt was a client and said that it was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said it'd be like coming home while he was walking in and ordering.
"I missed getting to smell it," she said.
# The Heavens of the Great
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Mr. Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in the public room for lunch.
The president, Mr. Roosevelt, liked the fancy Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the hen-breeder, and Maryland's turtle soup.
The day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato cake, potato sauce and dessert from the pumice.
"It was a demonstration of culinaryism for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelma.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also an opportunity for the Americans to learn how to live."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are house historians.
The last book of Coen, Ch Suey, tells us about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelma tell me about Llo East Siden flooring and food through his book 97 Orchard.
Its latest collaboration, A Square Metal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By persuading some kind of culinary solidarity, they will meet a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, insensitive lunch bar in the area of Flatiron, which has been active since the 1929 earthquake on the stock market.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato and vegetables.
When the editor ordered a meatloaf, the couple agreed to discuss eating down.
"The tools were very popular," Zigelman said.
Land loaf, liverloaf, beans.
They were made of a substance and some of the bad ingredients that continued the actual substance.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they make up your dinner.
Coe squistit.
"It must have felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
One year before the recession, the tables of the Americans, especially in rural areas, were like eating so much as a time-out-of-the-mill table.
The number of women working for male farmers, and the recent few were served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The A Square Meat book enacted the ways in which the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer an abundance of land.
"I brought food to the pivotal, troubling topic for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The exciting new, affordable news was: Mysterious foods, such as drugs and boxes, came from vegetative foods, and the box was "the way to use the food stars", said Ziegelman, because the people were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced with less dried green beans.
The man who had been in the middle of American meals became a sustainablely administered luxury product.
The characteristics of the ingredients were tested in terms of the quantity of food and quantity of food greater than the taste or even common sense in the environment.
In the course of the study, also in the case of a book without recipes, Zigelman prepared a modern meal where roasted onions were filled on earth.
"It wasn't much of a date table," Coe said.
Zigelma specified: "It was unlikely."
There is no way that the country is fit for fried onions.
This was excellent for many household recipes.
Households, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Economic Office in 1923-1943, employed more domestic farming than ever before or after.
Public recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines encouraged them to start to become "budjets" and to respond to the challenge of turning the fluffy spaghetti and the likes of the crowds into a delicious hand.
A Square Meat is the home of historical flavors.
It is particularly tasty to hear the reports of people who are hungry, such as President Herbert Hoover, to give me a cup of cake.
While he publicly praised the child again, Iowaland Food, he ate as a refined millionth of which had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber cake," Coe said.
She was wearing a tuxedo in the homeroom wearing a tuxedo.
He was awesome about everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example of his own.
The book says when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in the taste, the house became a place that "not only offered the lowest food in Washington, but also the worst food."
Many of the low-time meals were abandoned as soon as the land returned to its feet.
Our continuous concentration in calories and food, Ziegelma says, and in the way that we know how to cook, is perfect.
The couple said that in writing the book, they achieved a better understanding of Zigelman’s mother’s way of eating, for example, about how she could not throw away the food.
"He was really afraid of eating food," Coe said.
Ziegelma remembered: "He has even made people sick."
There was an inflammation.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe brought up the dessert they had prepared at home: the pumic dessert, which President Roosevelt had prepared for lunch this afternoon.
"It's called a bone foam," Ziejma said, adding that the common trick was to give the rare receptacles a prominent name.
The dessert didn't have cream foam, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All of them sank their spoons into an unwittingly sticky, brown vest.
It wasn't bad, it was not bad.
Coe played once and for all.
Sounding like a positive budgetist, he said, "A little bit of a cut-off walnut can help".
Ms Gilead is replaced by the costs of legal expenses in the fight against Merck against hepatitis C patent.
The Civil Service Tribunal has stated that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to receive the legal fees it has incurred in the dispute against Merck & Co Inc, a manufacturer of medicine for hepatitis C patients.
In June, after two patents of Merck, involving Gilead’s successes in Sovaldi and Harvoni, were announced for 200 million dollars, this change followed the fact that the U.S. judge found Merckin’s eleven, which included false and other unfair practices.
In a judgment delivered on Thursday, United States National Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was right to be given compensation for the actions brought against it.
Merck is trying to reach out to Gilead, which is the leader of the market in the generation of new hepatitis C medicines, which can obviously improve more than 90% of people with this liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other about the possession of the work of a laboratory based on the work of the Gilead medicine sofosbuvir.
The United States supports the claim that Manbij, under the control of Fathers, has taken full control of Manbij.
The United States forces have taken full control of the city of Manbij in the north of the border with the country, near the border, after the remaining Isis fighters left, one of the representatives said in a series.
Syria's democratic forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after one of the troops who fled to the city left the city.
More than 2,000 hostages had been released from the Sharfan Darwish SDF's Federal Army, the Manbij Soviet Council, had been held prisoner by the fighters, told Reuters by the military forces of the Sharfan Darwish SDF.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we have begun to explore it," he told Reuters.
The Clintons earned 10.07 million dollars in 2015, at a rate of 34.2 per cent of federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton's tax return in 2015 showed that the income of the democratic presidential candidate and his son in that year was 10 million dollars, and that their actual state tax rate was 34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton paid nearly 5.3 million dollars for speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster in his report on his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaaine from Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, paid 10 years' tax.
The second federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine set the standard for economic transparency," said Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier in the opinion.
In sharp contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax return.
It is usual for the United States presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law does not oblige them to do so.
Trump’s lawyers, a New Yorker’s lawyer, have relied on the audit of the central bank for reasons of public refusal to disclose their assets.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, spoke in a conscious publication of the link to the constitutive tax returns.
On Thursday, the Special Assistant to Trump, Michael Cohen, told the CNN that he would not allow Trump to report until the audit was completed.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 President of the Republican Republic, Mitt Romney and other Republican Members, have said that his refusal to ask questions about him, about his donations to charity, about him and about several other works, for example.
Clinton has encountered a problem with the publication of another network, which brought out prominent Republicans who urge Trump to publish its taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem of his financial speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate in the last few decades has done: he published his tax return," he told the public.
Polico has reported that it has not paid any or very little taxes in two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times businessman quoted another number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax percentages have become a lie in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported the appointment of an inquisitive investor, Warren Buffett, which would make sure that over a decade of earners would pay at least 30% of their taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Clinton's leave in Nebraska is the last month of Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Conglomerate is located there, challenged Trump's meeting and meeting with tax returns.
Buffett said that he is also in the process of controlling the tax administration, and that Trump does not "fear" the tax collection agency, but the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been publishing a tax until 2007.
Today, the actual federal tax rate of the Clintons resident in New York Chappaqua was around 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their actual rate was around 4 per cent.
Clinton's tax return in 2015 showed that only 100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main destination was a low-cost, index-linked investment firm, and Clinton reported $100,000 in dividends and interest income.

Policy environments as well as mobile means of elephant protection in Tanzania.
Naturalists in Tanzania are an unusual way to prevent elephants from walking to people's settlements - they throw animals with chili powdered condoms.
Keino has proved to be effective, and the idea has been developed recently by the Hungarian Foundation together with the US Nature Conservancy has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers from the north of Denmark to use violence to meet the four-threads in the protection of homes and hundreds without harming the animals.
In the past, many used spears to blame themselves.
Friday is a world elephant dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"From the time we developed the... tools, we have seen an immigration change in all the communities. It is now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," said Damien Bell, President of the Honeygus, in the opinion.
One or two times is involved in showing an invading elephant with a flashlight and a horn.
If it does not prevent the animal, they will be called "chili-pilvi".
The condom is filled with chili powder and earth mixture and with sonic, and then the condom is fixed so that only the ignition device remains visible.
When the condom is set on fire, it will burst the peacock and pulverize the chili powder into the air.
The smell of one is usually the same as sending an elephant in the other direction.
The last way to do this is to shoot a Roman candle in the air, and the fire is a deaf, bright explosion.
RT News: A Jewish characterist criticized a hotel in Berlin, which deleted the country's number of Arabs, in response to the request of the Arabs.
The French Jewish figure, after the media storm revealed that the Kumpinski Bristol Hotel in the vicinity does not indicate a heading. According to the worker, this is due to the "requests" of Asians.
The author of the film Claude Lanzmann, who wrote a documentary about the Holocaust, in an open letter in a German FAZ release written to a hotel called Kampinski Bristol in Berlin.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel's hotel in the country destination list.
However, the country is not mentioned among those who can speak directly from the bedroom.
How can it be possible that in September 2016, the new German capital, Israel was deleted and wiped out in 2016?
Lanzmann was written by Lanzmann.
On the other hand, Bristol, both of us, will be able to talk to people through their own phone.
An explanation was sought by the author at the hotel reception.
Lanzmann wrote that he was given an answer to "mading him".
The hotel recipeist said that it was "the deliberate decision of both hotels".
The underlying cause of the person was even more stunned by the person.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of the Israeli dyke number," they say according to Lanzmann.
The German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "the great truth", Zuddeutsche Zeitung.
"We were terrified and shocked by the incident.
It's already a big mistake in itself.
The fact is that this happened in Germany and this hotel chain.
This does not require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident created a quite a reaction when some people called it a scandal.
Some suggest that the Kinkinski Hotel was simply "reciprocated" to the alleged requirements of the Asians.
"Get away," said another publication that pointed out that a hotel located in Kurfurstendamm street is located near the synagogue.
He himself challenged all charges quickly and called it "unchecked" and "I'm sorry" from Lanzlán, Der Spiegel.
"It is clear not to include Israel in the fast-choice list ever made", says both representatives of Suddeuce Zeitung.
It adds that the number has now been added.
They were in search of cynical gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who showed their minds against them.
On Thursday, the students took together the police in the Brazilian country of Sao Paulo, when they met to protest against public reforms in the public sector.
He was looking for tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
They started when law enforcement tried to break up the student population, which resulted in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their horrors at plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of Sao Paolo, Mr. Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, little less than 100 people would be admitted to school, and 40,000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstrations were seen writing on the walls provisional graffiti against President Michel Temer.
The most recent demonstration took place only days after the protestors re-entered as a group to support the arrest of President Dilma Roussef while voting for his office in the country.

Since the packages were removed, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 7.9% since the year before, reports the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were removed, the Ambassador said that there was a great deal of interest in the country.
Russian companies are holding their existing routes to Iran, while companies are at an early stage of market access.
"Of course, one of the main objectives of bilateral cooperation in Iran is the expansion of trade", Dzhagaryyan said.
It was noted that during the first six months of 2016, there was a total turnover of 7 percentage points of turnover between Finland and the PRC, compared with 2015 in the same period.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5.
Imports from Iran increased from 16 to 158 million dollars.
"The growth was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
In addition, Dzhagaryan will be waiting for a record amount of tourists from Asia to Russia this year.
Last year, in Iran, the Russian foreign representation system gave the Iranian people about 35,000 dollars for travel mainly.
was also the first time in the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia.
"It's probably safe to say that last year's record number of partners in Russia is going to break," he said.
While the average number of visits to Iran is averaged, the ambassador wants to change.
"I can personally recommend visits to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi. They are kept in good condition by ancient Persian civilization," he said.
Scots Callum Skinner ran off to the finish when the scored bibs were taping the bike bar.
The Scottish Callum Skinner would like to be honoured in the football print at the Rio Cycling Stadium last year, when the three-thirds of the British team defended their championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy, who was replaced, the legend was of a young man when he reached the finish line and won the victory by the New Zealand team.
Britain took out the shock four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth in his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick when they took up a modest sixth-tribe race in the world championships in London, even though Hoy is in his first race.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Ambassador Jamie Staff.
This was done just in time for the Hiles to appear.
Hoy's stop also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man that the British coach was holding on to in the Scots, who is now conscious.
Hires, Kenny - who won the title with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner in the last Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead in the second round.
And the three of them won a double fight for gold.
After his own session, he was almost there, but Kenny stabbed the team, and Skinner held on to it.
The change was a major part of the transformation and included Hindes driving at a major pace to keep Kenny and especially Skinner holding pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at the BBC and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hines as he stood for the awards.
A 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said, "The comparison is admirable."
I'm just here to do my best and thank you for doing my part.
You and I will win the Olympic record in the finals and win the world's worlds.
It was absolutely incredible.
You can't be the best.
After winning in London in 2012 with Kenny and Hoy, Hillarys said that he had deliberately crashed on track after he crashed.
He then withdrew his comments, and the UK legal authorities have not complained.
there was no match in case of force majeure.
He said, "It felt like he was in London when there were so many British flags on the bench."
The team we've known for the last three months.
We have lost so many world worlds, so winning the Olympics is once again a lie.
One event, one grand to the people, who won seven out of all ten cycling trails both in Beijing and in London.
If this reflects the development of the last six months, we will be waiting for the happy five days at the Cycling Stadium.
On the basis of the well-being shown by Ken, it is at all impossible for him to hope for another Hoy's exploit, for the three Olympics to win in the Olympic Games.
That means that Kenny - which is about 12 years older than Hoy, who has also been born on 23th of October (seemingly on Sunday in British sports, which is also the anniversary of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would be worth six gold and one silver.
It would be like Hoyl's.
Kenny will be in the next race, which will be today and the next three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just having fun right now.
The game race is always the best.
It'll be won together with friends.
It is, in fact, only lonely to win alone."
He said, "If he defeats another two great medals, he should give the knight the value."
This was the only match of the day, but the United Kingdom received more news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in time for the four, four-kilometre team-driving.
The time was 3:51:49.
The world record that won the gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:699.
The first round and final (22.42) will be created today, the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be at the centre of the focus.
He had a dispute with the judges last night about the times when the officials invited him to the survey.
In the same competition that will take place and will take place tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Mingavia Katie Archibald were in the middle of the world at a time of 4:13:260.
The United Kingdom team has learned to trust that its biggest team of bikers will take over the middle of the Olympics and reach a whole set of medals.
After real normal and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been underestimated before the Rio Games.
Taista has had a drama, the least of which has not been the technical director, Shane Sutton, in April for sexuality and temptation, as well as the completion of the career of seniors such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
On the basis of the first night’s competitions at the Cycling Stadium, however, it seems that the real idea of the United Kingdom’s now rising to its peak at the moment is now in place again.
The future of the capitalisation of Portland is a question of the future because of the reduction in the contract.
The future of Portland Victoria's attic, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity-sharing company of the factory revealed that one of the factory's owners is in the final contract, so there is an operation of all distributions.
The measure follows the decision taken earlier this year by the Government of Victoria that the aid required to carry out its activities will not be extended.
The 20-year period of the definitive investigation period will end in late July.
Even 2,000 jobs may be in danger at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be in danger, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, the balloon effect can be possible, as the melter uses about 10% of the electricity generation in the Victorian economy.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the meltdown of Point Henry, which was last year for the closure of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown is losing money and is under threat of closure.
The measure has now been following for several years the speculation of its future, which resulted from a strong Australian dollar and has recently been the result of its production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large vacuum from its Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other parties to determine their other agreements.
Most of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL expects the activities of the Portland plant to continue, which means that the physical electricity demand of the meltant will come to life," he said.
According to AGL, these agreements are the so-called "parliamentary agreements" which were to enter into force in January 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month stay, so they run out of contracts in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects the results of the contracts to be achieved in 2017", said the electricity company.
All most effective results for AGL from the financial year 2018 onwards are currently subject to a strong outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of contracts in its bookkeeping by 1 million dollars.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "will not affect Alcoa ... to keep the melting operation or to protect the defrost of power".
The US company stated that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was due to enter into force this year in January, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been alert to both the Portland melt in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago factory nearby, because of the poor economic situation in the sector.
Last week, AGL CEO Stephen Mikkelsen said to analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
"If both plants enter the market, this is a significant calculation in the demand for [Union] markets.
For the power producer, this would not be good," he said.
Kendall, not just the true TV star of the Cardashians, is on the cover of the September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-mother Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth clan, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's preferred October issue.
Kendall, who has been a brand ambassador for Estee Judge and has been a model for Milan, Paris and New York fashion shows, will report the news on Thursday's Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of dear people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The complaint was followed by a unique (or perhaps only for the Kardashian way?), a hand-written reality video, where the whole of the KARDashian-Jenner clan (the most important problems in the case of Rob and Caitlyn, and which was accompanied by all the favorites, the Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of their sister, but which ended up with the following: they were planning a surprise party.
This is the cliché of almost every child's television series "breeding day" (Seacrest's sentence lines "you probably didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the prettiest bunny), but Kris had to get anyone else out of this public.
This is because we have certainly moved on to a new era of Kardashian by the Vogue of September.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's application first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the issue of September is just his own song.
Vogue's September number is the most popular edition of the year.
Its thickness is greater than that of the fashion magazine, and the figure attracts a huge number of advertisers (from Fashion, it was calculated that last year's 832-page study 615 had advertising content).
Its cover is so excited to be exposed that over the last two years, images of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
The most recent men on the deck have been, among other things, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evans and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there has really been more about "the celebrities who act as models" than about "the models that are celebrities".
The winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence were on the cover in 2013, after Lady Gaga's incarnation.
But if it happened that Jenner, whose picture was taken as a "foretime model", would hit the first one, he'd be in good company.
These celebrities are not famous people's relatives or potential stars or young people today who are able to do all of Snapchat (although Jenner is all of this).
They are rightly talented women who are active in entertainment.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career in the course of the Lemandaden publication.
Not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
In his true-tv history, Jenner's role in the fashion world will always be a pain in the ass.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model, Stephanie Seymour, criticised Jenner and this colleague, Gigi Hadidia, calling him "the present-day bucket."
This feeling was re-energised by the Sonner’s Vogue deck.
Irregularity is not known.
Kendall Sonner is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
He is a supermodel word in the most up-to-date sense.
It's the model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling the "Estee Lider" to the Estee Lider.
He and all of his people are selling pictures of you on their own, in their own applications under the protection of the payment mechanism.
He's making pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she gave to the Love magazine.
And in good time, possibly just to watch Kourtney and today, he's a reality TV star.

Over 160,000 of the most vulnerable are turned away from the Community's legal centres, while the sector is building up the impact of further cuts on its already marginal activities.
Three out of three seven people in Queensland - mainly elderly people, others, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair ethics and the like - are already turned away in their search for legal advice and representation.
The Community's extremities are already being prepared for further cutbacks.
In the next month, these two centres will account for 30% of their federal finances.
James Farrell, the head of the Court of Justice of the Queensland Community, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away every year.
Farrell said that if a federal government decision is not withdrawn, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's community's common centres are, in fact, underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being turned away from basic services," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and debilitated debts, disaggregated families, unfairly disfellowshiped workers - all people have families, and this statement shows that they do not receive the help of their own people.
The Federal Government will cut funding in June 30, 2017, which means that some of the vulnerable citizens of Queensland are forced to navigate into complex legal areas of the air.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice, as well as Mr. George Brandis of Queensland, for them to immediately withdraw these funding methods so that we can get their backs on their problems.
Last year, the Government of the United States implemented a commitment to raise the level of funding for legal assistance to the national average.
It is now time to examine the needs of the Community Court of Justice and their customer communities, and the Government of Palazczuz will invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged in court after he was accused of being attacked by a weapon.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged for the right that they claimed to have done nothing until they were told that the head of the North Carolina campaign threatened to use a gun in their drive in Jeep.
The incident was described in a complaint brought by Vincent Bordin, the former U.S. consultant of the U.S. campaign, on Wednesday, at the Court of Justice of the States of the United States of America.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be discussed internally before he realized that "it will not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip " put out a pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and worked the pipe against Vincent's kneecap," said Bordini in the action.
Following the selection of the local and regional campaign management, Bordin heard that at least four other people had had the same presence with Phillip, it was said in the action.
"You don't have to open things to do harm," Bordini said in the action.
Haaste will only come two days after the Republican presidential election became angry when it came to the public in North Carolina that "second increase of people" - which usually involves the owners of arms and gunmen - could take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, was elected and would be eligible.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word away from the context and that he does not support violence.
In the face of Bordin's challenge, the campaign is seeking compensation for negligent supervision and for the violence, assault and emotional shock caused by Phillip.
Mr. Trumpin Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the comment.
The efforts to reach Phillip have failed.
WCCB, local news company Charlote, reports Phillip's departure from the campaign.
His referrals to Innovative Consulting Systems were not answered immediately.
The campaign of Republican President Donald Trump has been controversial.
The legal case against Bordini is Donald J. Trump for Use., 16-CS-14 Oh, the Court of Justice, the Superior Court Division Country of Mecklen (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow.
Hearow brings recovery and prosperity throughout the stomach, not just to local communities and different parts of London.
For me, this was Heathrow's great charm, just as it was also the charm of the 2012 London Games, when we are living in a great deal of trouble to make sure that all of our people and the region are living in this race.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratt and East End.
And we are doing so again by creating an opportunity for local people and industry close to Goodthrow.
For local communities alone, 10,000 new workshops and 40,000 new jobs are created, and job unemployment is removed from work.
As long as before the London 2012 race, some will come to think that the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I was told that Britain would not be ready for the games, and that we were forced to face the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be true about Heathrow.
The obstacles will always be overcome, but Heathrow will answer every question that is put to it.
The Olympics, including Heathrow, are an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is possible to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 billion jobs, both in terms of skills and employment, around the house and around the United Kingdom.
We have a powerful team in Heathrow, which has completed a 11 billion pound infrastructure investment programme in time and in the budget, while remaining in: T5, voted for the world's best airport terminal in five years in a row, T2, built between the world's two fastest runways.
The team is now ready to carry out the third runway, which supports a 16 billion-pound private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am convinced that the Heathrow extension is also a success for the United Kingdom.
It is time to channel the lives of the Olympic Games and expand the lives of Heathrow, to ensure the future and the economy of our art and employment, which means Britain can provide you with.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and the former Secretary-General for Trade in Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse games for preventing advertising.
For those companies that receive money from online advertising, attempts to pass the advertising program are "cat and mouse", I mean one of the attempts to prepare this program.
On Thursday, only two days after the online announcement that it would prevent advertisers from using their computer on their websites, Adblock Plus Writes a blog writing saying that users could update the software filters to re-install advertisements on the social network pages.
Tuesday, Facebook said that the code for its website would be exchanged around the ads so that it would be easier for advertisers to find out which parts of the ads are side-by-side.
But now the Adblock says it's turned again.
In the book Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "a kind of back-to-back struggle between the community and its translators to prevent open-source advertising has been underway since the idea of preventing advertising" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own decision soon.
The fact that the world's largest public media effort is part of the action is a strong demonstration of the great tragedy that adsists have become to industry.
On a global scale, around 200 million people are using advertisers, last year's Pagefair and later's research. This is almost a quadruple of the number of people who have spent this year in 2013.
1.03 million active day-to-day users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
The company, however, has been working on the promoters of the pages used on the computer, since mobile advertising providers do not operate on Facebook's mobile application to a social network or network, a representative.
Computer advertisements continue to bring real income to make it worth the investment of this kind of action on Facebook.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said that it would update its "advertisement" tool to give people more power as to how to target ads.
On Thursday, Facebook argued that Adblock’s new filters were worrying, as they would also hinder part of the site’s non-advertising content.
"This is not good for people, and we are planning to tackle the problem," said the Facebook representative in the e-mail statement.
Machine inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we are instead focused on building tools such as Ad Pnies that give control to people.
Apparently, she was hit by a woman on a Swiss highway because of her death.
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
He's looking for witnesses after the woman was on the road under several vehicles on Thursday's early hours in the event of accident.
The incident occurred on the A1 route near Morges's in the position of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
She did "unlikely act" and settled in the dark on the road, where there were several vehicles hit, the Vaudin police said in the opinion.
The victim who clearly tried to kill himself was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene of the accident.
Several drivers involved in the event have already been interviewed, but not all of them have yet been identified, the police that appeals to them and all witnesses of the incident to be heard.
The criminal investigation is an urgent step in this kind of situation, and the lawyer, Gilles Hofstetter, told Le Tribune de Genevel about Le Tribune de Genevel.
"Let's see if any of the involved drivers are being prosecuted.
Was it possible to avoid a conflict?
It's up to the D.A.'s office," Hofstter said.
In the last five years, two similar cases suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - where there was a person walking in the dark on the engine - it was estimated that drivers cannot wait to meet a pedestrian on the road in the middle of the night, the search was said.
Last year, a conviction was released on the charges of a failure after he was hit and killed by a man who was lying on the A! road near Paynerne on one night of 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, was reported to court.
I stated that the pol that was responding to the dialogue was timely, and that the position of a man on the road was "a complete extraordinary and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone who has information on Thursday near Morges will contact the number 021 6 to 83 46 or 021 6 to 44 44.
2001 climate model: Venus was once a real-worlder.
According to the assessment of this new climate model, Venus was likely to be present once.
Scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study Venus's past using tools and algorithms that are similar to that of climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the filling of the carbon dioxide and hot water in the Vent could possibly have been of a global nature.
Scientists have previously asked that Venus's speed of spinning translates its thick atmosphere.
The last copy suggests that the Vesi could have been thin, earthlike atmosphere, and it could still have been smooth.
He also looked at the surface formation of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have drier areas than the Earth, but there was once a lot of water and geographical variations in order to make life possible and to protect it from flooding.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30 per cent lower.
"In the simulation of the GIS model, the slow rotation of Venus will reveal it to the sun for one to two months," explained GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in his announcement.
This will hold the surface and produce rain that creates a thick cloud layer of clouds that, as if it were an umbrella protecting the surface largely from the third heat.
In fact, the result is that average global temperatures are slightly cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a story of the evolution of Venus, which is similar to what planet scientists had previously assumed.
Venus was probably once hosted, it was exposed to too much heat and UV light over many millions of years.
The oceans disappeared and its water vapours were burned in the UV light.
When its hydrogen escaped, the rest of the carbon dioxide atmosphere and its carbonic properties - Venus, which we now know, remain.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate in the Geological Research Letters publication.
Patrick Roy is giving up on the plague of Avalanchen's coach.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the work of the Vice-President of the Board of Directors and the Deputy Commissioner for hockey affairs in the World Cupado Avalanche on Thursday, which means that the possibility of a lack of influence in the team decision-making process was a factor in the decision-making process.
The Vice President/Director-General of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have been doing my duty as Vice-President and Chief Supervisor of hockey affairs at Colorado Avalanche, with enthusiasm, passion and cause", a 50-year-old Roy said in his opinion.
During summer, I am thinking about how I can improve this team so that I can give it its best heart and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the position of the coach and the vice-president of hockey matters should be fully in line with the opinion of the organisation.
There must also be an opportunity to influence the decisions that affect the team's performance.
The conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for this attack on the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision," Sakic said.
We do all that he has done for the organization, and we wish me happiness in this day and age.
Roy was appointed as the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league for the first time in the Newalanchen period of 2013-14.
He led the team to a 112 point and a mid-division victory, but in the first round of the game, Minnesota knocked down the game of Colorado in the first round, and the team has not continued for the last two years.
The Avalanche games for the period 2015-16 ended with a total of 39 winnings, 39 defeats and 4 games, and the team lost at five points to Wild to lose the wild card to the wild game.
The goalkeeper Roy, who was appointed to Hall of Fame, won four Stanley Cups - two in both the Court Canadiens and the Avalanche.
Northern oil workers are negotiating and delaying the strike.
Labour struggles for workers in the North Sea for wages will be postponed when all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the main negotiators said.
Laws have been organised against the Public Service Service of the North Sea by the Royal Dutch Cell at random.
"Wood Corporation and RMT Unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute", read in the joint opinion.
In the next few weeks, we will have all the meetings early in the first place so that we can take a fresh look at our problems.
According to the AUs, their recent work struggle, which they are supposed to be the first in more than 25 years, was an objection to the objections, up to 30% of the wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut the fees for North Sea contractors for around 9% of the market pressure.
The company's remuneration will result in a 10% contribution from contractors in its countries of 2014.
In conclusion, he concluded that the additional elements would give the company the necessary room for manoeuvre to close the downsizing trend in the market.
On the other hand, it has reduced thousands of people's pay lists and announced its plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, as a result of which the company will lighten its operations with the British company BG.
The companies are under pressure from lower oil prices, and this is the fact that the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union is made worse.
Mr. Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member, met with the co-chairmen earlier this week to discuss one of the fourth largest North Sea labour conflicts.
He said that the North Sea was an essential part of the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said.
In the North Sea, investments of less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects are expected in 2016, while the average of the last five years has been around USD 7 billion.
Kepler determines the star's speed at which to play in the population of Plejats.
The latter mission of Kepler's Mission has helped astronomers to make the most complete list of the spin speeds of the stars of the Plejats' Star Forces.
New information will help astronomers to understand why the constellation stars are fluctuating at variable speeds, as well as how the revolutions are related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope that by comparing our efforts with other stars, we will now learn more about the relationship between mass, age and even the history of that system," said Luisa Rebull, researcher at the centre of Pasadena's Infrequent Process and Analysis, in a press release.
The audience of Plejads is located 445 next year from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 12 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're in the middle now.
At the end of the spin, these mature stars are popping large numbers of stars from the star.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star ages, its speed starts to slow down.
The coil will measure the speed of each hour by following the appearance of the kerbs, such as the kerbs of the sun, to identify them.
The list of the last major speeds suggests that the larger stars run slower than the more massive stars.
Rebull compares the heads to the cheerleaders, which make the bigger ones slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "Baltic" of the players, we see that slow spinners are usually more massive, while the biggest spinners are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the stardom of the Plejas is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the star properties at the speeds of rotation.
"The multitude of Plejats offers anchor star spinning for theoretical models that embrace both sides, younger ones and parents," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why and why the stars are going to turn their rotational speed and, so to speak, hang their "it's" shoe.
Rebull and his colleagues photographed the latest analysis of the spin speeds of the Plejats in three articles, which will soon be published in Astronomical Journal.
