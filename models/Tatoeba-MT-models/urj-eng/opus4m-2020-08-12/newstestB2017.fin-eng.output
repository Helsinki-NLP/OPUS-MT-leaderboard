A 28-year-old cook was found dead in a Sanfranciscal shopping centre in Sanfrancisco.
A 28-year-old cook recently moved to San Francisco when she was found at the local mall's portal this year.
The victim's brother says that he didn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt his brother. "He had made himself right."
The body identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscala Frank Galicia from the shopping mall in Westfield on Wednesday morning is reported to the San Francisco Agency for Legal Affairs.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a personal crime.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia reported to ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank had previously worked in Boston as a dual worker, working for Frank, who had worked for his dream job at the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant, which was three months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters restaurant said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We're small, we're together, we're big, we're sorry," he says.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells of Frank's first residence in the hostels, but he had, of course, made his order.
"He found a flat and had a girlfriend," he told Louis Galicia KGO.
Louis Galicia says she didn't know anyone who would want to hurt her little brother.
"He was kind and generous.
The way to be with each other was to make food for all of us," says Louis Galicia.
"He never wants to deal with enough with him.
He was the brother who went along with the power.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an unwrought diamond that read every day," he says.
In all cases, there is something known about the reference number 415-999-44 of the San Francisco Police Department.
Lawful junior doctors require new work-related measures to be taken.
The representatives of British junior doctors (who are the main physicians responsible for Finland) have called on them to trade and asked for permission to engage in a new work struggle in a new job dispute.
The Committee of Junior Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is calling for the general support of further work activities from the beginning of September.
According to the JDC, the problems of the agreement have not been resolved by the parties.
The Junior Doctors and the Board of Directors rejected the BMA agreement at the end of February.
Of the votes cast, 58% voted in favour of the agreement.
On Thursday evening, President of the Junior Committee, Ellen McCourt, published a letter to the JDC members, which he wrote to the Board of Directors, which, according to McCourt, was responsible for rejecting the agreement.
In the text, it says: "In the light of all this, the Government of the JPC has voted in favour of the whole new proposal for a new agreement and insists that all of our concerns be subject to new public consultations.
In response to the Government's silence, the government of JDC has today submitted a formal request to the BMA Government, requesting it to continue to engage in further work from the beginning of September."
This is why the junior doctors have been present for the third time this year, which included the first complete work stops ever seen in the history of the British public education system.
Director of BMA's junior doctors, Johann Malawi, resigned after the vote, for he did not accept the negotiated terms and conditions recommended by BMA.
Malawana said to the members of BMA that the agreement was good and should be approved. 54 000 junior doctors and teachers took part in the vote.
After the vote, Prime Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and concern doctors.
Rural and Turkey: the Union of the East?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the Presidents and the Presidents of the First and First World met with a view to agreeing on Tuesday and reaching a final conclusion on the six-month period of the vote and economic sanctions.
Still, at Vladimir Putin's reception of his Turkish staff in the golden hall of his Peter Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara had a greater desire for reconciliation.
The parties did, however, hold,
But Putin's face looked flat, and he didn't even have much to do with his own slow point of view.
On the other hand, Mr Putin, Mr Recep Tayyip Erdoga, once again spoke of 'good friend'.
I didn't miss the bills myself.
In addition, he promised that relations with Moldova would return even better than before.
The next day, the newspaper of one of our countries reported that Erdogan did something like nothing bad would never happen.
I personally understood his enthusiasm quite the opposite.
The Newest World War II saw that the Prime Minister has never done anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the reason for the crisis: Turkey shot down a bad fighter plane at the Syrian border.
The changing event at the time of the event was intense.
In particular, he attacked Ankara and accused him of stab wounds.
The insult was even greater, because it came from a desperate friend.
Getting real trust in the way of the world will be real, perhaps impossible.
The popular opinion of the Russian people has changed since the curse.
For months, the state-controlled media conducted a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
Something else changed the fact that the Turks were responsible for everything.
The most serious were the high officials' accusations that Erdogan's own family has benefited from trade in Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied the attack.
However, the final message from the record was that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was held just so that Putin received the required apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, it was possible to make some kind of victory.
The means of holding an armed stand for Ankara are clear.
All in all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can have after last month's almost separated from power in the failed coup d'état.
The recent attacks in the field are also a great deal of pressure on him.
There is also an effect on the harmony.
The sanctions have struck Turkey hard, especially the Charter no-fly ban, while it is often the case that many many Russian tourists travel to the Turk coast every day.
Almost 90 percent of the plot has collapsed.
What will happen is that the tour operators and charters will certainly be advocating the facilitation when the air traffic can be completed.
They put their faith in a delay season for the Mediterranean Sea.
In the meantime, in the meantime, the state of Finland has announced a fall in the price of butter and vegetables, while agricultural imports are allowed to be imported again.
"Tours on the ground, tomatoes back here," was written in the article of the magazine Veemost.
But also had a higher value for Moscow.
Ankara is heading west, for he believes that he has been silent in the coup d'état.
Not to forget the old grudge about the progress of the Turkish EU membership negotiations and the lack of Putin. Putin, who is eager to use the cool distances and to break the true ties to the west.
Certainly the leader won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup d'état.
This was, of course, clear to Moscow, who is in pain with its own concerns about the change of power.
Consequently, Russia and Turkey, at their summit at the practitioner sea level, are able to convey an image that one analyst pictured as "the alliance of the aliens": two countries that are experiencing the disdain of the West and are able to join forces.
Despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two of them.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacemaker, but where the world and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It is a great deal to say that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, each of them told us at a press conference that they had no business at all.
The President of the Republic, on a discretionary basis, refused to answer the question of differences between countries, while Putin pointed out them.
There is no clear agreement between countries on where they could pursue their minds in Syria.
Given the opportunity for the entire world, which NATO Member State Turkey created when shooting down a war machine, it is better that, after six open hostilities, these two Heads of State are still talking about the Head of State.
Bank of Scotland banks lose their customers outside Scotland.
According to the RBS bank, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be rescheduled in such a way that in the future it will only provide the so-called “back office” services.
The Bank of Scotland disappears from its client outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand originally joined the bank's global target.
The bank had to step away from its goals when it turned around eight years ago and got back to England.
At that time, brand-makers have been using RBS to generate other consumer finance brands.
It sponsors a lot of international sport, such as the Six Nations rugby and the Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now it is considered right to let the international brands in the front.
The Group of Scotland will remain at the disposal of Scottish customers, but it will not be used as an abbreviation for RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be converted into NatWestes, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchanges.
Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also other smaller private business brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during the presentation to customers and staff in Inverness-shir.
He said to BBC Scotland: "RBS is turning into an investment brand and because of what our staff are doing, because we are now becoming much more different brands.
Since the bank became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Today, our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in one's own company, and our employees work with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring the Six Nations rug, and it has produced a different brand profile for sponsoring sport.
"Now is the time to turn into a bank for different brands, because basically it is about how we can make the bank a better customer," says the bank.
"It would have been very ordinary three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for our customers and put brands in place.
However, our work and focus on the needs of our customers, instead of our own needs, has changed a lot.
You can bring those brands back again, so I think the time is right."
Frankie Dettor, President of the Predilection for profit in Newmarket and achieved a 3 000th profit.
Dettor sprays the champagne twice after winning in Newmarket, which generates 3 000 profits for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettor confirmed his 3000th payout in the UK championship series in Newmarket.
This milestone he reached with his horse Predilection to win the same victory on the track of his country. The predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
Police Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey, which holds this milestone in a level playing field in competitions on the track.
He's had access to Sir Gordons, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson before.
The third time the title Dettor, who formerly won at Ghayyar, says: "This is the special one.
My tunnels are gone, and my family is here too.
I'm very excited that this happened in Newmarket, because right here I ended up here six years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot at all, but a completely ordinary night and 20,000-person audience.
I'm surprised and I'm feeling a great humiliation."
After his victory, the branch receives the festivities with Predileton.
Two of them have reached the milestone in the fights, and they are the Prime Minister Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who won his record career over 4300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4 498 winnings.
"Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that she has just reached this milestone, which is rarely accessible.
He's smart and strong, but he's the one who knows what he knows.
He is a fantastic representative of rivalry, his enthusiasm and his dreary have brought to the public for many years."
"In other words, a few years ago, in Epsomi, he would have won 6 000 races if he did not compete only on the rocks and only on the big races!
Seriously, Frankie's horse racing career in the UK has been winning for almost 30 years, which has been a great challenge to follow.
He is a lively person, which is good for the British race, but above all, he is an incredible jockey."
Frankie Dettor, in an obvious way, threw himself off his back and jumped off his back.
"From the flying goal incomes to the busy incomes, Frankie Dettor has been an example of British racing for two years now.
There are ups and downs on the way.
He has won many major races, including his famous victory at Ascot in +372 "Magnificence Seven", but he has also worked for the reason of his accident and his existence in competition.
Three years ago, when the ban on competition ended, he was beginning to have difficulty with reading, but he showed an admirable nature of strength, seemed to his doubters and came back at all.
He is not yet in the process of ending his career – Dettor has now said that he wants to continue his career until at least 50 years of age."
Putin's separation manager Sergei Ivanovin's separation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin suddenly released his CEO Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been known for his trusted inner part of Putin for years.
Ivanov, 63, now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport sector.
According to the information provided by Kremli, President Putin " decided to release Ivanov as Head of the Presidential Administration", but no arguments were given for the vote.
The mission was appointed as Deputy Head of Ivanov since 2012 by Anton Vaino.
Only 44, 44, is a former diplomat.
In 1972, Vano, born in Tallinn, graduated from the Moscow National Institute of Relations (MGIMO) and has worked in the Tokyo Embassy in the past.
Later he held a meeting with the President's Section of the Protocol and the Government's Office, reports the Kremlin's Russian-speaking website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: "Please be grateful for your love.
The main task of my administration is to support the operation as Head of State, which means that the draft laws are to be drawn up and supervised, and that the instructions you have given are to be implemented."
Putin told some of the press that Ivanov himself was a divorce and recommended persecution for his successor.
What are you talking about?
has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin, and so does Putin. He also has a KGB history.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a public meeting with President Putin, both of them said that Ivanov would withdraw from his mission at his own request.
Despite the support shown to the cameras, the explanations assure only a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are you fired from some kind of power struggle?
He doesn't know yet.
There is a very dubious argument in Turkey that, as far as possible, the President-elected man is concerned with environmental policy.
Kremli's paper presents Ivanov's words to Putin, where he says: "It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give me this very complex and often difficult job for four years.
I have now served as the President's Executive Director for four and eight months."
Ivanov took the call in December 2011.
First of all, he was the Prime Minister and the Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Security Council of Russia and also former member of the KGB of the State Civil Service Service in Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin acted as Head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which was replaced by KGB, and Ivanov was appointed his deputy head.
When Putin came to power, he took Ivanov to one of the four people he trusted.
I used to think that Ivanov might be next after the second season of President Putin, as it would have been the choice of Putin for the second period.
The mission will be for another member of Putin's neighborhood, Dmitri Medvedev.
The tree became immediately, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
The star of the series Criminal Minds - FBI Researchers - Thomas Gibson was sacked after he defeated the producer.
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The collecting companies ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios reported the issues in their joint information.
Agent Aaron Hotchner, who was known as Gibson, had apologized on Thursday before he was informed that he had been suspended.
"We had creative differences of opinion.
I'm sorry that this is what I'm doing here," he's doing when he comes in.
About how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents, then later, let's know about ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously on Dharma & Greg, a 54-year-old Gibson has been on the show since its first production season in Finland since 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I've been putting my life and soul on it for the last 12 years," says Gibson in his public announcement last night.
"I hoped I could do it, it's not possible now.
I would like to thank all the manuscripts, producers, actors, our great production team and the most important: the best fans that you could ever wish for."
The 12th edition of the series will start on the 28th day of September in the United States.
The mysterious beaching of fish in the Banffila garden is the mysterious shoreline of fish.
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has been asked to help determine the fish lost in his world.
Bai suspects that these 75 fish are moods that lie on earth as the dawn of the cycle.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, showed a vision of the image material in Periscope and hoped to receive an answer to the change of these five-star fish.
The crossing of Queensferry is now connected to Fifee.
A total of £1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the Queensferry route to the north and the land bridge, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four parts between the "tips", which are now the only ones around the three pillars of the bridge.
The share of bridge Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 pipelines.
A total of £1.35 billion is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the work site today and was one of the first to come from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry's crossroads.
We are all about to make real progress in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30,000 concretes and steel in building this bridge section alone.
The construction of the bridge between the land bridge and the bridge bridge is a delicate transaction, which requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
It is now close to 79% of the total bridge, and the rest of the case is about to receive its concrete currency in Rosyth today, which means that the deck is ready to be raised again."
Michael Martin, Head of Fort Crossing Bridge Construction Project, says: "The completion of the first bridge section is always an essential tool for all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this part represents the top of the road and water industry.
When the last part of the road was closed and connected to the High Tower platform, then we had to close the remaining northern hole (i.e. the north).
This was done by pulling the north side of the land bridge 700 metres west of the country.
This was a massive and, at the same time, a great deal of precision.
Massive, since the land bridge is 222 metres long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and was to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.
And highly accurate, because the tolerances that had to be carried out in the work were very small – only a few millimetres.
Lucky for you, everything went well."
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Department tells about the three men's eloquent fear of fear.
Anglesey used his fishing water for three men to die like a miracle trade.
Moelfre OLI's marine rescue status alarmed at 13.20 a.m. on the first day of the alarm, in time for its crew to report an accident in the Moelfre Bay.
The two men were desperate to swim in safety while their ride continued to maintain the air pilot.
"We saw the boat roaming right next to them and imagined the worst," says Vince Jones, who runs the Moelfre lifeboat.
"By the time we got to the water, the strong winds had fortunately transported the boat away from them."
Of the two men in the local fishing boat, the second one, 60 years of age, was found in an exhausted hold of the boys and no life vests.
All of them were taken to a rescue boat and taken to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: "It is a wonder that these three people who are left for water are still alive and well.
The boat's engine was equipped with an emergency alarm cord, but for some reason it had disengaged at the time of the crash from the man at the time of the fall.
They were really lucky."
Poméon Go hunt brings you good luck and luck.
It is fascinating to watch how the world changes.
During the last decade, many have chosen why you and your parents are no longer going out to play, but will remain inside to stare at their screens.
Pomégon Go makes people get up on the couch and move.
Originally, it took only a television view, then additionally video games and the latest smartphone.
So it is amazing to note that the technique and the outside movement do not exclude each other from each other.
Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go wild game. Pokémon Go is a game application whose characters come from a video game created in the 1990s (also known as a set of drawings, games and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural events, this also broke out shortly before the new game came in early October in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
In other countries, there was a decline in languishment because of a huge interest that overloaded the schools.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go game passed Tinder and was just as high as it was known.
So, the game's working?
In short, players are going out to look for poker devices on their mobile phone that are monitored by GPS. When a poker is found, it can be "photo" (using a phone screen) or "record" (via a telephone screenshot).
Villey has taken a video game with him to the younger one and has returned the half-ways to the couch.
the game has added a significant amount of "medium" to take.
Washington Post recently reported on an Apple Watch computer cardiogram application that found within two days of the launch of the game that the 30-minute daily number suddenly rose from 45% to 53%. The cardiogram followed by 35,000 users.
You don't know who's playing the Pokémon Go game, it only sees the content of the exercise decision.
Many public health campaigns, which encourage people to enter the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have gone to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have been missing.
However, the importance of physical activity should not be underestimated.
There is a higher likelihood of a regular circulation of drugs or depression.
Helps exercise control, lowers the blood pressure, prevents people from exercising and brings a great deal of other benefits.
The pokémon Go game's fineness is that it makes people out to do something that they enjoy.
In this way, three basic things – exercise, fresh air and sun and joy – will be achieved.
It is possible, during the course of the process, to get even new ones.
As usual, this whole thing includes the hideous gamblers.
Yeah, well, somebody can walk through the door when they play.
What about it?
We're good to go.
For example, even though mobile devices like Fitbit may have already been able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not allow themselves to get involved, such as Pokémon Go does.
The novelty disappears, the use decreases over time.
However, the success of pokémons will result in more games, where applications and virtual reality will be combined into activity in the present world, which will increase the exercise of people who are leaving the hunt and improve their condition and self.

Simone Bales caught big women in a variety of telecommunications activities.
Let's go.
Never mind.
Simone Biles is an immunity for all of these people.
The dynamics jump.
I don't know what to do with it.
The jaws are ringing per second.
Everything's fine.
And now, at last, the Olympics winner too.
The American 19-year-old telecommunications operator won the multiplicity championship on Thursday and increased the existence of himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic Light Bowl.
The overall score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of a silver-based "Final Five" teammate, Aly Raisman, and Aly Raisman, and Alia Äfofin, the Bronze Commissioner.
The United States of America's Simone Biles will be present in Poland in the finals of the multi-competition of women's telecommunications in Rio de Janeiro, USA, on Thursday 2016 summer Olympics in Rio, USA.
The party became the fourth consecutive, and the fourth American of all time, who won the multi-competition championship, thus helping him to build his reputation at best or even at all times.
Biles hurled in tears when his final whole point was seen and his long way to this moment ended.
Savour takes you to a whole new range of reach and puts you in the same position as other superstars in sport, such as Michael P49s:
Biles has been in existence for the last three years and has won 15 championship medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with such powerful and accurate programmes that in 19 years, the Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called himself "the most powerful telecommunications winner of all time".
There was only one other law that was going on first and foremost between Bales and himself and the burden of great expectations, not so much for Bales and the rest of the world.
Going home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of megalomaniacs would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisma will die after winning the gold and silver in the finals of the multi-competition competition between women and women at Rio Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, USA. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first grand prize on Tuesday as a point for the i-to-i-team team coordinated and now retired Martha Karolyin gone away.
Although Biles claimed that there has never been anything before at the top, however, that is not really true.
Part of his permanto programme, which includes a series of volts known as his card, has been adapted to Latin music, which might well be heard in the streets outside the Olympic Ocean of Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
Even when his parents were young enough to adopt and find Coach Aimee Boorman's mother, he has become a power figure.
We have not lost any competition since June 2009, and as long as Biles is waiting for it.
Despite the fact that Musta got a little lead on two turns, it was like a shelling.
There's still a boom and a perm where Bales will defend the world.
He went back to the lead after getting 15.43 points from the pole and turned the final result at 15.3.3 points from the perma.
Raisman hugs him gently while they wait for the final points — which was just a figure — and tears began to appear around the bright and red outline color of Biles when the dream of his copybook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small tear to the four-year-old competition, when he first divided the second rather than the second but then lost the bronze to the Property with a rerun.
This time the 22-year-old team leader, whom the little ones call the team "mother" was clearly ahead of the Älefia.
He took flight genders to the public after his permantatus program, and then turned to the position of winner, which at times seemed uncertain.
As far as the party is concerned, this earlier show of 19 years of age and widespread television is now all over again:
Let's tell you three music in the car after being the victim of a serial killer.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in the most devastating mass murder in Phoenix for ten years, and the victims were sitting in a car and listening to the music when they were shot, telling me the report was published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on 12th of the streetside, a car parked in the parking lot was shot by Angela Rohelle Liner, by Stefani R. Ellis and by Eljal ance Maleah.
The shooter was standing on the side of the passenger side of the car, which he shot with a handgun at two shots and then escaped by another car, the information says.
There's no doubt that the third victim's fault wasn't a hit, because the assailant didn't take the handbags or the other adult victim's hearing found 2 900.
The police informant in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, is now calling to see if he's connected to a four-year-old attack.
A total of seven people are dead and two injured in nine attacks that have occurred mainly in the four months of the Latin American population.
"It is common for events that they have happened in residential areas around the homes," Howard told CBS's tax and radio company CBS to KPHO earlier this month.
It is believed that there are several types of vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the 1990's, the old and the old Cadillac or Lincoln in the 1990's.
The investigators do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related and that the perpetrator is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of his injuries, where he died.
Liner, 31, and Elja's daughter Maleah will immediately be killed at the scene.
The seer told him that three had been in the car a lot of times listening to music.
In both cases, the shooter is believed to be the same.
The researchers found the seals and took the bullet and the bullet fragments from the engine space from the seat.
The mother of a son of six years of age with Moxiqualia: "The things are getting better."
Most 6 years of age, including Edmund Picciu, likes singing, toys and, of course, mothers.
As in most of the age-overs, Edmund has a microcephaly, or inherent minor, which is due to his own Elizabeth Picciuton genetic disorder, which he was not aware of in the past.
"When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I would not survive this.
I can't get through this.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true – of course you are bound by it," he says.
Elizabeth and her about Vincent were told that Edmund would never know who they were or might not be alive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that the child should be placed in the facility.
"The reaction was that I didn't think there was any such thing anymore," says Picciu.
Edmund sees the role.
Edmund sat down and let himself rot when he was only 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
He is going on to do his own thing.
He's helped and he's riding a bicycle.
He liked to play with his two brothers and love to play.
Elizabeth is looking at the sign that Edmund invented, meaning "Sing me".
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
Not only does it mean the common sign language, but it also includes the ideas of Edmund himself.
There may be a number of diseases in the background of micefalia: hereditary, as in the case of Edmund, or infections during pregnancy, such as mumps or ziza virus.
There is great variation in symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with a zikavirus.
Picciu remembers the feeling of the unknown.
"I keep on saying, "What do we do,
What do we do?"
He still does not know.
"I haven't asked the prophecy in a long time, for I don't think anyone's gonna let me do it."
But there is a hope for advice on what is best for mothers who have congenital defects caused by the virus.
"You'll get better.
There's a way to sort things out.
You love your child, and your child loves you."
The heavy rains and floods caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi.
The Governor of Louisania recently announced the state of emergency due to heavy rainfall and widespread floods.
According to the National Standard Service, several rivers in South-East Louis and South Mississippi are flooding over their thunders and spreading throughout the area as a result of heavy rainfalls.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, says that the States are currently in contact with local authorities and that assistance is already on the way to flood areas.
Minister Mike Steele of the Governor's Office for National Security and Emergency Response reports that the Agency is receiving requests for flood controls, Russians and sandstorms.
According to the Steele, only the Tangi Devil County is one of tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain valid until the end of the rest of South Louisiana in most parts of the world.
According to the information provided by the public authorities, there may still be 76 more to come.
There was a flood warning in South Alabama on the second day the rains went on in the Mobile area.
During the week near the Comite River, close to Baton Rouge and the Amite River, Denham Springs, both of which are in Vietnam, are expected to rise to record heights.
According to Director Alek Krautman, many of the houses on the banks of the rivers may be flooded in the front areas of the Baton Rouge.
He also says that the fires underrun in the Ascension District pose a threat, for the flooding rivers return to Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River just south of the Mississippi State border in South Africa had already risen at nine o’clock on the next day.
The rescue work continued in the prisons of Tai and Wilkinson in south-west Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law, were often close to the Gloster among those who were saved.
Hansford, 62, tells us that the Beaver Creek River, which is normally over 120 metres from his house, is right over the middle of the night.
The other male who was living nearby had turned him on.
"We got up, and came with the next meal," says Hansmann.
"It spreads over my waist."
It was said to the Hansel that the river will never rise so high in the 48 years that he has lived in the region.
Hansford tells us that he and his family all have injuries, and he himself is the only one who can sleep.
The rescue workers had saved all three large military trucks and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they thought they were safe.
Author Kautmann says that the floods are spreading rapidly when the heavy rains are mixed, and they are already planning to set up a definition of a set of appointments.
He tells us from information provided by a close to Livingston’s supervisor that there had been a rainfall of nearly 350 mm between midnight and New morning.
Routmann says that soil is heavy after the rains that started on Wednesday.
The authorities say that due to the flooding of heavy rains and streets, the inhabitants of Tangipahoa district were forced from their homes and schools were canceled in four schools.
The student devil councilman had told CBS's Land of WWL that there were 200 homes under fire.
The inhabitants had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has risen to both of them.
Regional Director Robby Miller reports that 72 people and seven pets were killed, who had been trapped in a flood.
Evacuated people have been given an open shelter in the cities of Kesku and Hamd.
"They'll get back in their homes when the water goes away," he says.
In Hammond's City of Tangipaha district, there were about two streets in the world due to the fire, and residents were offered sand bags to try to prevent water from getting into their homes and their businesses.
"The last time we experienced a great flood in March," says Lacy Landrum, Member of the Board of Governors.
"This flood appears to be equivalent."
During the mission, the rains continued in a steady direction along the Gulf coast, says Rupert Lacy, Chief Officer of the district of Harrison.
Lacy tells us that on Thursday a handful of houses under the flood were reported, but the latest information had not yet come to light.
Head of the Value Foods Store Keith Townson says he's been living in the region for 40 years now.
"I've seen water in places, I haven't seen it, and I've seen more rain."
A number of bullets released in the body from 6 years of age Mahajlia will be able to cope with a shooting incident in Philadelphia.
According to the police, a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, who is already another 6-year-old, who has been shot in the city for a while.
The grandparents of the child told the CBS Philadelphia that the boy was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the guy had a third gunshot wound in the joints, the leg, the arm and the abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets," said Delores Melendez, the boy's grandmother, said to the company Delores Melendez.
"I can't believe this is happening."
The man is in critical condition at the hospital and has had multiple injections.
You're going to tell the press that the boy is believed to be dead.
He was beginning to be the first to be in the local primary school.
The show was one of the four people who was shot in the Germantown population.
The subject of the shooting was also married to two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old male.
Another 29-year-old was reported to be critical and two others were stable, says CBS Philadelphia.
According to the company, the child was found on the front seat next to the 29-year-old in critical condition.
That's all I had in the car, and now he's looking into whether one of the injured men is a shooter.
The police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that this was a crossfire between several armed men.
The location of the incident was too much of a running gun type of shells, which originate from a variety of weaponry weapons.
"It is quite clear that this was an ongoing role.
Kadu had seals all over the main corridor.
There have been several armed fighters on the ground, and they have been actively involved in the shooting", Chief Inspector Anthony Ginali of Philadelphia Police reported to the station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
They're not done, and I hear they're going through surveillance.
Another shooting victim in the city this year was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was lost in her play on Tuesday at home in the town of West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and she's still a suspect.
Why do we need to avoid Tome, Gabby and Laurieta?
For this reason, I call women's telecommunications an Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons why.
First of all, I have been in every summer biblical since 19th April, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
The second, the three gymnastics of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colourful girls.
The composition of the team, summed up by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everything proud.
The team represents America at all.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the world.
For the last four years, the best female force has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in positions 1 and 2.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise winner for the cats, and all of America was cheering.
Today the world has been given to the incredible performances and surprising and mastering works of Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, the world of the three-world world’s greatest world-class Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
On Thursday, he became the fourth consecutive American to win the gold in the multiplicity of women.
Teammate Aly Raisman won silver.
The views are like the top of the species, but the same does not appear to be the case with the telecommunications conditions all over the world.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same result as Aly and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They are the last five ("Final Five") because the next telecommunications Olympic team will only have four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year coach.
The reality, however, is that telecommunications is a expensive business and gymnastics activity mainly in private telecommunications euro, which is maintained by our parents. Parents are paid for operating expenses, premises, travel, presence housing, competition fees, hotel charges (for supervisors, gymnators and family members) etc.
Most of the premises in the euro area are located in prosperous residential areas that are able to support their operations.
The training of the Telecommunications Officers takes place on this occasion, and this means expensive and long-term commitment for the families of the gymnastics community.
Simone Biles coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez coach Maggie Havey have both trained the image to be a hobby since they started working in a business activity.
We need to organise cheaper and better available telecommunications skills for the many young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie have created.
I founded my own telecommunications foundation 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered an open or affordable opportunity for more than 15,000 young people (mostly black and Latin Americans), and some of these young people have enjoyed national and international championships.
In September, we will continue our activities in my home town of Detroit so that we can offer high-quality telecommunications to young people who deserve to learn and benefit from this great Olympic project.
Working hard to develop strength, brightness and body coordination and teach hard work, discipline and determination.
This brings life-long life-long benefits and promotes good health and well-being at work and at work.
The team has made up some of the many young girls who now want to start telecommunications, and that's just great.
Involvement in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison's true "girl power", which you will be able to show for the Olympics, and for motivating so many young girls from the background to start their ways of well-being, strong and successful youth for a second time.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new exiles.
Ministers expressed their wish for a dispute on remuneration and working conditions by adopting a new agreement with the BMA (British Medical Association), but 58% of the 37 000 so-called junior physicians, a specialist doctor, voted against the proposal.
In July, Prime Minister Hunt announced his plans to reach agreement on a mandatory basis and said that the British Public Service System (NHS) is "not in the country" and that any further delay would be detrimental to the public and to the children.
The first junior doctors will move to a new agreement, which will include changes in working and working conditions, in order to improve health care in times of social exclusion.
Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Junior Committee, delivered an opinion yesterday at which she said: "The junior doctors are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, which is particularly concerned that it will stimulate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
There are only three weeks when the first parents are reintroduced into the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, and we are running out of time.
Bma has tried to settle the dispute in a language spoken, but the government has opposed the debate efforts unintentionally and, in the meantime, in no way opposed it in any way.
The same is true of the fact that in the month of last month the Uni Hunt made a promise that his door would always be open.
Mr. Hunt must now act, replace the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If not, junior doctors are ready for new work-related measures."
At the end of the month, nearly 13,000 routine measures and 100,000 reception times were suspended at the end of April, when nurses and consultants were asked to assist the working doctors on the strike.
Ministers wanted to conclude the dispute on the changes by concluding a new agreement with the British medical staff of the profession.
The trade union BMA wants a better place to work for 54 000 junior doctors, who would be involved in the contract.
Mr Daniel Mortimer, director of NHS, appealed to junior doctors so that they would not engage in new strikes.
Multimer says: "Working measures achieve very little or nothing, but they already create pressure for teams and services operating at extreme borders and cause concern, distress and disturbance for help, care and their families.
Over the past two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Committee and, in conjunction with the Ministry of Health and the others, we have welcomed their concerns about the role and disclosure of the facts of the supervisor.
The employees were hopeful that the continued positive commitment to other important issues – development, educational flexibility, return to further education, training, recognition of educational programmes, freedom of movement for men and women – was an indication of how serious workers, health education England and the Ministry of Education are sticking to the agreements concluded with BMA in November, February and June."
In the days of approximately 2,40 €, the drug may compromise the risk of a first attack.
Thousands of primary patients are about €2.40 available for use when recommending that it be given to more people and to longer term use.
Anti-drugs ticagrelor reduces the risk of new births in patients with heart disease.
This is already being done 12 months after the second instance, which is likely to cause a stroke or a new one.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) and evaluates the introduction of new treatments has instructed that ticagrelor should be given for a further period of four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the British Public Health System (NHS) and evaluates the introduction of new treatments, has instructed that ticagrelor should be given for a further period of four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 of them are re-energised or re-energised.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the fat material that is produced in the blood vessels, which makes the plaques work.
If it cracks, it can create a blood clot, which causes a blood clot to enter the heart and cause a stroke.
And if the blood clot is loose, it can pass through the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new scene is higher among the newly arrived people.
The ticagrelor produced by AstraZeneca, some of which are called Brilique, reduces this risk by altering the probability of tulips.
In today’s nice guidelines, it is recommended that ticagrelor be given for the first 90 mg for 12 months, then the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and that aspirin be given twice more for another three-day period.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for the Evaluation of Treatment Methods (NICE) says: "Although effective treatments to prevent disease progression and symptoms are available, up to one-quarter of the patients have a new seizure or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
Fear of renewal can have a very real effect on the quality of life.
We have come to conclude that ticagrelor, combined with aspirin, will effectively contribute to the risk of new seizures and nausea in people who have already had the status quo.
The adoption of a temporary use of ticagrelor increases the choice of choice for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Due to the limited information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of death, if it is used for more than one year, the use of the treatment in the draft guidance is not recommended for longer.
Because of the climate of political correcting, the tone of vote in Muslims flourished because of the climate of political correcting.
Last year, the former mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was disfellowshiped from his role as a result of corruption, which was the title of the report.
The climate of political correctness led to the blindness of the public eye from a wide range of people in the Muslim community, revealed today by a Government report published today.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles was very hard to criticise the violence, the election officers and the councils for having been keeping their eyes shut because of "the hypersensitivity to ethnicism and religion".
According to Pickles, a former Minister of State for Regional Affairs and the current anti-corruption power figure, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that he should have been allowed to form the guard chains outside of the places of origin in order to protect the feared and voters.
It proposes that voters should issue an identity card to prove their identity when they vote.
At the moment, the voter should only tell us his or her address and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be soaked at their origins after voting in black, so that no one can vote again.
More should be done to protect journalists," Sir Eric says.
He insists that the officials have access to government documents and that the decisions of the informal board and of the work be improved.
"The purpose is not only to prevent fraud, but also to combat corruption and fraud and the culture of economic interest, in particular in the public administration," he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report from East London after the vote scandal at Tower Hamlett.
Last year's final decision was that then Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed for the sake of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
It was concluded that Rahma "whispered" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by blaming them for racism and against Islam.
Rahman said, "the basis of his campaign is that it was the true duty of every religious Muslim to vote for him."
In fact, the Ääni even кел was open or given in a way that made the vote into something else by making it into a different one.
According to Sir Eric, a clear view of the truth was obtained from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the post-postal education in which the senior members of the Muslim community were told that they had been forced to vote against the candidate they had chosen.
Sir Eric (in the picture) made a number of suggestions for cleaning up the voting system, including the requirement of identity card at the place of origin.
The report says: "There has been evidence that some vulnerable ethnic minority groups, especially children and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of parents, especially in Pakistan- and Bangladesh-based communities."
"It was believed that... the institutions of the state had closed their eyes because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicism and religion from such activities."
Sir Eric made 50 ways to make the system clear, including the prohibition of processing postal ticket tickets from political activists, in order to prevent 'recording'.
At the same time, the report under review by Theresa May calls for even the minimum checks on the registration connection in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and benefits.
consideration of measures requiring the voters to submit an identity card before voting.
Dipping your fingers out of the blue after voting so that no one can vote again.
Regular checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of the voters.
The establishment of a three-year limit for requests for a systematic translation.
The prohibition of processing postage stamps and envelopes from political activists is prohibited.
the right to create security chains around the places of asylum.
The law making it easier to raise accusations of intimidation under the Population Act on the basis of the 19th of October Representation of the People Act on the extension of the right to vote.
The prohibition of curfew on grounds of nationality.
Only English is allowed on asylum (except for Wales).
In order to ensure that the staff supervises the need for only one person to go to the polling station, it is necessary to ensure that there is only one person to attend.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the Dutch police and considers it "surprising" that no prosecutions were brought in the event of the case of Stockholm Hamlett.
"The election separated Lutfur Rahman and his representative from office for corruption and numerous illegal practices," he says.
"He was found to have no reasonable doubt and the criminal evidence threshold was exceeded on a number of grounds."
He also criticised the powerful 'cross-checks' of the departments of the departments of the parliamentary elections.
"The last year's ruling of the Court in the case of Tower Hamles was a wake-up call," says Sir Eric.
"Our country is the mother of all Parliaments, but this good is threatened by the worrying and disguised doomsday by some parties and the prohibition of it."

The CBC's Olympic Commentator asks for an excuse to say that the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig" is a Chinese swimmer.
Byron MacDonalds’ analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth instead of women in a 4 x 200 metre free mail surprised CBC's direct Olympic report on Wednesday.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said during the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer's "damaged smell" and "as dead" race.
Reporter Byron MacDonald Used to turn off his microphone when he started to give his own opinions at the end of the 4 x 200 m free-to-air finals.
MacDonald, which according to CBC's reporting system, was heard as saying: "The only small, 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, went on time and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese culinary Ai Yanhan, 14, swims into the second part of the time from 1:57.79, and remained at 1.66 miles from Canada's Taylor Ruck, which helped the Canadians to swim.
The viewers around Canada are quick to react after they are shocked by the tone and language of the comment.
Emmett Macfarlane said: "Did the CBC's teller just say that a 14-year-old Chinese dildo died like a pig??
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air."
The Chinese Ai Yanhania, which was swimming in the finals of the 4 x 200 m free space exchange, was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He quickly came up with rich, byron MacDonald's critical comments, and many called for him to be born.
Twitchers wouldn't keep their words when they heard how careless Byron Macdonald was.
"Wa #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist crowd.
Scott Rossel, hosted by the CBC delegation, very much regretted MacDonald's speeches: "We apologize for the comments made on the drug use.
It was a choice of words to choose from, and we regret that this happened."
CBC was likely to condemn more than 90 times the number of people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Mr Scott Russel expressed his apologies for MacDonald.
CBC then copied and glued its complaints to more than 90 other twitcher comments, which were selected from MacDonald's speeches.
The company often also made a public request.
"We sincerely regret these opinions and the fact that they have arrived at the transmission.
We just asked our viewers for forgiveness last night, and we also apologized to our social partners.
For the sake of clarity, Byron’s comments were related to the swimmer’s performance, not personally.
Despite this, they were inappropriate and the choice of words had to be complained, and Byron is very sorry about what he said."
On Thursday evening, MacDonald expressed his regret at the broadcast and tried to defend his speech by thinking that you did not mean it in writing.
"I would like to apologize for my comment I gave yesterday after the ladies' communication," said MacDonald at CBC's Olympic Mission.
"I was referring to the exercise of the swimmer, not to the person.
Without a doubt, I mean nothing to be disrespectful with what I mean, and I am very sorry."
In order to prevent private underwear from entering the market, many customers found themselves in a competitive environment.
The customers didn't know where to watch the guy get dressed in the middle of Primark to play underpants.
He actually got worse by judging, he saw them in his underwear, took them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to turn around and tried out to have four underbellys in a store in the Bouveree Place mall in Folkeston.
Folkestone Bouvere Place shopping center in the Primark chain, where a person tried his underwear on and returned to the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, tells me that after testing the underwear, she sat down and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He tells of what happened: "People had no faith in their eyes.
The woman was in the middle of a trade, wearing her underwear off the shelf, taking off her own trims and underpants, and wearing them.
He will not do it in your sight, but he will do it without being ashamed.
Everyone was staring at him when he took off the underwear he had tested, and I didn't think so, because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it again three times before deciding that I didn't like any of them, but he acted and walked out.
I didn't seem to care about the looks... or the person who would finally buy the underwear that he had created."
Davidson, 33-year-old who lives in a town, says, "How disgusting is it to think that someone's taking home their underwear, which someone else is looking for, and they're not washed."
The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon.
"I understand that the trade staff is seeking to remove those items from the sale after they had left – which is right.
It would be better to take home the underpants and notice that someone else has come without having been washed after that," adds Davidson.
Primark's informant commented: "Primark is aware of the situation that took place on Tuesday, 9 August in the Folkestone movement.
All these products have been removed from the sale."
This is how you defend yourself against an armed attack by means of the Krav.
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it the safest.
We interviewed Prime Minister Rhon Mizrach, who lives in New York City, and asked him how to get away with an assailant or an assailant in the near distance.
We'll see how you can defend yourself against the opponent, whether or not the opponent will contact you or guarantee you.
The first thing you have to do is turn around to see the attacker and get off the firing line, says Mizrachi.
After this, hold the gun so that it stays between your elbow and arm, and take the rest of your conversations with your elbow.
Then kick the rest of the knee on the turn of the knee, and when he goes to pain with a double click, span him with a gun and turn him upside down.
The technology is the opposite if an armed bomber approaches the front. You have to turn away from the firing line, grab the gun and turn it around so that the attacker cannot fire.
Put your head in the same position on the gun and push the button on the other side. Turn the gun away from the attacker, move back and hold the gun in the opposite direction.
Does that make sense?
Watch how Mizraki does it.
However, remember that it is safest to get rid of the shooter by handing over your hands – unless you are the head of the Krav Magad.
Ian Wright, a world traveler who makes a difference, is looking at Europe's most remote places.
The British traveler created his resistance and a far-reaching reflex for his experiment by tearing Europe apart into more muddy and hateful places.
Suffolian leader and mobile author Ian Wright, 51, tried to prove his resistance by evoking a euro banknote, a handheld Pådilly Circus, a toilet handkerchief and a public telephone.
To make sure that Wright measured the objects on the lumometer to see for himself and for the viewers what the language was working on.
The experiment was made into a documentary film after Ian Wright - an internal strength, and the results were taken care of.
The idea of licking a toilet sink can be disgusting, but in fact, more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On its way to a different corner of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals for the establishment and health of good bacteria in the intestine.
For all happiness, nothing that was perceived would cause more than a mouth of malice.
Ian Wright began to become well-known for his travel programme, where he began to instill his gut with endurance around the world and eat some things.
No doubt the resistance of Wright was challenged by the use of handrails and toilet sweepers in railway stations.
Wright says in the document: "I have been very concerned about my health since I was a child, and I have put everything in my mouth, such as soil, worms and curvy."
In a movie, he really is a real person who pays a fee.
There was only one fire in a gruesome general toilet in Russia.
The lumen meter measured more than 4000 units of the sample.
For the sake of comparison, it is noted that the amount of handwashed hands is generally under 60.
There was a fire in a new general toilet where Wright refused to lick when the snow measured at the end of 4000 units — the same number in the newly washed hands is less than 60.
Wright, together with Valio, is a documentary film produced in Ian Wright – an internal force where the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom, is measured.
Wright says in the document: "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
4,000 units! Nothing is dirty than that!
The place is so disgusting that I don't make anything here."
Wright produced a documentary film with Ian Wright – Integrated Power in cooperation with Choosing.
From the hand hand Wright was given fatty bacteria and Valio Gefilus containing vitamins C and D, which helps to strengthen the gut’s good database and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, the head of the manager of the snack, juice and new products of the selection, says: "We wanted to offer you something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at, and at the same time tells us about the benefits of probiotics.
We spent a lot of time thinking about something crazy, and finally we got to ask Ian."
The health of the person has become a global trend.
"We wanted to bring them into the widest context instead of just talking about products and to share our common environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of the gut and about what it has to do with resistance.
Online health has become a global trend and it allows us to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
The film also shows our sense of humor!"
The film directed by Tom Hakaa more to this: "Let's just say that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had heard some of the places we asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, it was easier for Ian to know every subject, while part was pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty guns shot on tape."
At the end of 2015, 84 per cent of respondents were involved in the use of milk bacteria in particular in stomach and intestine well-being, and 58 per cent reported at least once that they had used products that had been added to them.
The family of criminals destroyed the town-owned apartment in Saltashi, Cornwall, in the city of Cornwall before it was destroyed.
A family of criminals after they lost £50,000 in damage to the town's own rentals after they had been evicted for the neighborhood terror.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband, Shaun Rebilcock, have been evicted from their home in Cornwall Saltash following a number of complaints against a couple.
When the couple were forced to leave the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company found that the apartment was in the building in a busy place.
There were huge openings on the walls, flooring had been torn off, the trash had been spread to the floors and the walls were paved with graffiti.
The couple are now moving, and they are living in private homes.
Donna McEvoy, Head of the Cornwall Housing Agency of Cornwall, says that she is afraid that she may no longer be able to save the dwelling.
He says: "This has been a complete nightmare for the people who live here, and it should not be tolerated.
It's a lot to weigh, since it's probably not as easy to know as a part of Cornwall.
The garden is evil, as is its name."
The couple had eight boys who lived in a bed at night. According to each of them, the violence of family included street fights on baseball grounds, neighborhood intimidation, generation and communication, as well as loud conversations, rioting and cursing.
The lessee, 47 years old, Skeldon, received an order for non-participation in June.
Old waste was found in several rooms in the house under threat.
In the past, drugs had been sold from the house, and the floorboards had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, a family fight on the street and the police were regularly sent to visit.
The Cornwall Housing Agency removed a couple of measures this week, after having given them an additional 11 weeks to move away on a voluntary basis.
The easy neighbors were grateful for their wedding — they said the whole world was for the earth.
One of the neighbors says, "They didn't care about anyone.
We lived in their neighborhood for 20 years, and this whole time has been difficult.
He's been here an incredible number of times."
"Today we did not fall asleep.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it.
I'm going to be great now that you've finally been evicted."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Head of the Forces of the Cornwall Housing Agency, tells us that the family was unable to cooperate with the local authorities.
He lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly called.
Trash and old toys had been thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: "It is a pity that the lessee does not have any responsibility for his or her own affairs and for his or her family's affairs, as this is always the last thing that Cornwall's Housing Agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, since it was extraordinary, and their actions must have been remarkable to look at the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my work, the police of Devon and Cornwall, and the Commissioners who took part in the work and who offered to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of the neighbours and let them know that non-participation is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says that three sons had all lived in bed at different times, but were already in two decades.
A dirty mattress found in one of the houses after the wedding.
Housing workers now need to clean up the house with the poor people around them.
In 2014, he made a raid in the apartment and spent more than 70 grams of hemp, and in addition heaps and other items, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined once he had been found guilty of possession of class B drugs for his purpose.
In 2013, he was responsible for the tombstone of his dead son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard of moving to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The structures of many rooms were flooded with graffiti.
We are forced to insist that the tenants who break the lease rules are forced to order.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall's police tell us this wedding is a clear warning to the tenants who are constantly threatening the rules.
"This is a clear message for those who think they can act in ways that they want no accusations, as well as for those who are unable to deal with this kind of behavior," says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall will never accept crime and social practices, and will continue to cooperate with our partners to protect our communities.
Low-flighted, beach shirked by the army's laptop scared the tourists in Portugal.
Sun servicemen were busy in Aveiro, Portugal.
The Portuguese Aerial P-3C Orion aircraft crashed alarmingly further.
According to the air force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows the moment when tourists were forced to flee when the jet that was floating on the ground crashed over the beach.
The dramatic images show that the world's world is coming into contact with tourists on a sandy beach in northern Portugal in Aveire.
The lobbyists returned to their feet worryingly, understandably, about the engine that had gone out, which began to be heard before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
This happened yesterday afternoon at Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
One of the dramatic pass-by images and videos of the holidayers published in common media was Daniel Fernandes, who says, "It passed the beach twice as far away, and there was a place where it looks like it's going to land."
Nno Argoja adds, "I was surfing, and I'm sure the plane will fall on me."
The tourists on the Aveiro beach were shocked when suddenly the fire came out and flew on a shocking pitch.
The second air force informed today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight designed to identify coastal fishing vessels, which was why the operation had to be so far away.
According to the pilot, they had to be lower than normal, because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires was detrimental to the visibility, but according to the air force, this was not a threat to security.
Forest fires have caused the ruin in parts of the continent-Portugal and have killed four people on the site.
The Portuguese air force informed today that due to the poor visibility of fog and smoke, the pilot had to be so low.
The aircraft was on a flight in which fishing vessels were caught.
Taking into account the results of the first half of the year, it is expected to be better than expected.
The South Karelian social and health (Exote) worked in January - June 3.4 million in a better way than planned.
The result was 4.3 per cent of the surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good for family and social services, where the development of preventive services has enabled the installation to be opened up.
The May Guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Esote is trying to allocate a series of transactions to this year.
The difference covers the rest of the previous deficit.
The overrun may be used to reduce the number of lines and to buy measures.
The whole year is expected to be 4.6 million more than planned.
The White Government will deal with the mid-term review on the first Wednesday.
Seven hundred and seven special border guards swore a military whale in Imola.
Seventy alternates at the Sea and Coastal School took a oath on the other side of the military force.
Immmola was hosted at a military conference at the Border and Maritime Guards School in Immmola.
The 10th MIF event took place with the Assembly’s agency.
A soldier took a oath from 70 alternates.
The end-users will be trained for border security, intelligence and mission tasks that are required.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were applied for this year as a special frontier member.
For the selection tests, they were invited to 250.
Finals have been trained in Immola since 2007.
In the event of the event, the veteran meeting was attended by five veterans of the border forces during the last 20 years.
The average age of other people is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
Forensic intelligence helps to solve crimes and exposes serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 police institutions since 2014, RTA, or criminal intelligence, has been active and integrated.
One’s activity is outwardly invisible.
The Häme Police Unit comprises four policemen in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's pulled by a sergeant in Lahti.
Auditor General works in Lahti, Finland.
One of the strengths is the IT dedicated staff in Hämeenlinna.
All of them work in a civil shelter.
The unit has demonstrated its capacity and necessity, see Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides various reports to other police officers.
In need, it has, among other things, sought out information about asylum seekers.
Information on fresh working methods is available.
The establishment of analyses is an open-ended development of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. the fact that the police are at the most likely to leave the area of the whistles only when they receive an alert.
By means of a unit of information and analysis, daily police operations are targeted where they are most needed.
A single database of criminal intelligence, less than three national units, and each police department’s own criminal intelligence unit, was established with the police department.
In Vantaa, the PTR Centre, in liaison with the Central Criminal Police, is operating nationally.
PTR units work in accordance with the principles of public policy, customs and border control.
RTA services work according to the police departments in the shared areas and have the task of providing information to both local authorities and the national units.
In the field of research, there is a scope for dialogue outside the territory of the external territory.
Where a single matter is well aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the role of the RTA unit is to know what is going on throughout the police department.
Science also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, so that is what crime does.
R & D services have better computer skills than the basic policy.
Does the unit work by means of registers, alert database and logs to draw attention to new phenomena, product-type crimes or similar crimes?
This is being developed for sorting, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal intelligence.
People have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it's real or not.
The basis of the action consists of a certain image of the author.
Sorting can be done on the basis of whether or not it is done, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from mistakes.
RTA-unit workers do not travel around the city with their collars up and running, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both individuals and criminals are not reported, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent criminal offences.
The police will publicly disclose the methods if they are expected to pose a threat.
This was, for example, an early summer news, a way to make up for homes that were empty in the middle of the night.
Those who did put the apartment in the outer door stick, the second needle or the piece of tape they were looking at were the residents really on the way.
The case file shall be at least for the parties concerned.
The analysis has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever order a protocol on the law of the commons, which may indicate, for example, that there are some fingerprints from the place.
The next time we go to the thieves, we go to the gloves.
An interview has been conducted with Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppo from Häme to police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola from East Finland police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärve from Joensuu police station and Inspector Arto Tuomela from central crime police.
Methodology and consistency of information to plan common activities.
In the background, the reduction in labour and finance volumes will be reduced.
The first steps towards a new approach were already taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-pronged PORA review, which ended by the end of 2013.
National cooperation is used to provide information from outside the borders of Finland and its own institution.
Daddy's father-in-law was killed in Syria by a London schoolgirl.
They say that one of the three British students who joined Is in the last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer, Tasnym Akunjee, will tell you that last year, Sultana died in the Syrian Raqaria a few months ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a military bombing in Raqpa, which is the father's base for reasons, told ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and her family was just trying to escape from the country and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a will, so that people can understand this as a matter of fact when they go to the neighborhood - and who makes you give up the decision to leave," says Akunjee.
In February 2015, on one of the two other aircrafts with the eastern schoolgirls in Turkey and continued to travel by bus to the border with Syria.
He was told that he had gone to Syria to marry an Isis fighter and had only been widowed a few months after the wedding.
Reid says that Clinton supports Garland's name in the highest position if chosen.
Then, Warden Harry Reid says he is convinced that the democratic president, Hillary Clinton, will appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court of Justice if he is sued as President.
The Republican representatives have not agreed to confirm Garland's name after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to Mitch McConnell, the next President will elect the person who will be appointed to the seat of Antonin Scalia, the Judge-Rapporteur of the Supreme Court.
Reid said in a phone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton's choice of Garland "to make a big deal out of it".
Reid's informant later made it clear that this was just speculation and that Reid wasn't speaking directly with Clinton about whether or not this was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wanted to "play the pot" by doing something else.
Garland is against the Court of Appeal’s main judge in Columbia County Court.
Reid says that the Republicans preventing Garland's name are President Donald Trumpin's "handlers" and "developers".
With him Trump won't be in office.
According to the Torats magazine, nude calendars are equally common for both men and women.
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and brings to the market the 1970s style and the calendar of 2017 inspired by Pirell.
Instead of a model of publicity, they will be able to find the top models of their 2017 NU Muses calendars for the next quarter.
The CEO of Treats, Steve Shaw, told me earlier this year that his nudity magazine differs from that of the old school's Playboy magazines, because he said: "Playboy is for men.
"For this woman."
Looks like he's thinking the same thing.
"We need to bring back timeless and classic nudity, where, wherever each and every one of us, we can enjoy and inspire these women's bodies," says Shaw in a press release.
"They sure want to participate in this project because it will be a true work of art."
To model calendars, you can send images by means of electronic means or participate in open selections in Los Angeles and New York.
What do you mean, "buy"?
Single, middle-aged people are looking for a look.
Before you start writing a comment on the hostile statement with the title not all of the Single Aged Men, this statement is based on actual research data.
According to YouGov, there is no millennial generation boom behind the re-entry of much-spoken discs when millions of people want to know the real thing in their hands, but instead there is a middle age struggle.
The age that recently purchased the album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age 18 to 24 are the least likely buyers.
Moreover, it is not just the desire of the amateurs to fish the plates, but the importance is emotional: it is likely that the purchasers of the hard drives will hide (56% v. 53%) and will be alone (69% v. 66%).
Is it the result of YourGoov?
If this blog had been a television broadcast, which would follow me walking along the busy Soho Street, wearing a jewelless gray jacuzzi suit. I would think I would be busy, bending my hands to pieces and saying something about tradition, like, "Let's find out."
So let's be clear.
Although Soho has lost its charm and rososity slowly, while the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperches chains have taken over before the facilities owned by the public entrepreneurs, there is still a handful of specializers left.
I would probably like to ask the photographer to stop the two for a moment when I am looking very close to the men who are visiting these shops and will try to find out what it is and what it is all about.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (at present by two young women, three middle-aged men) for the Reckless Records (at present three middle-aged men, one woman in ten) is attending a meeting during the afternoon and the next working hours has been added to the offer.
I'll ask him if he's a financier.
"I think I am," he says.
"I've got about 3000 to 40,000."
These plates make her living room in her mind, as you can see from the picture. (Stutarts sent the picture to me now, I did not follow her home.)
The reason why he has made such a large number of albums and singles is partly in his own way. He is now able to buy discs that he couldn’t afford when they first found out, and to buy again the things he was young and broke up had to sell.
"I got a lot of 60's and early 70's stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12 and probably too young to get them," he says.
He agrees that the purchase of vinyl plates is most likely introverts that are comfortable with themselves, and he adds, "I don't smoke, and I don't drink much.
It's evil."
Wez, 25 Sister Ray, also believes that many of their units fit the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new human stream, which has been replaced by a press hypnotic.
"My discussions have given up all of my entire work in 1998 or 1999.
The people who sold their CDs in their own way are now selling their CDs back in their own way," he says.
This can change a certain kind of bilge-wave boom.
Then what is the alleged emotional meaning of the discs?
In just a few seconds, he realizes, like Phonica, that they offer a comfortable community for the likes of each other.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly affected by the payment system of their contact.
The world’s world may be giggling some of the vinylfanes, where returning to familiar discs means stability and reminds youth of its untimely existence.
"I think it sometimes fills up some hole or material property for some kind of comfort," Wez says.
"I saw it myself as a sorority, and I think so too.
It's an easy way to get things out of your mind."
"We're like social workers!" is the work of Wez's co-worker, who's behind the record.
A April ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought the vinyl album last month had not yet listened to the disc.
The opinion also revealed that 41 out of the 41 players have a record player that they never use, and 7 out of the 7 out of the buyers of the disc have no own record player at all.
At this point in time, I'd probably look like a serious face, like a stack of boss nova sizes.
The new arrival of discs is also accompanied by the "popace", which has been observed by Jonny, 42, who is currently the customer of the Sounds of the Universe (three middle-aged men).
"A new customer recently came into circulation and said he didn't have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead so he can put it in his shelf," says Jonny.
"The proportion of these customers is not large, however.
For these people, the world is much better than music.
Some of our customers tell us that there is not yet a record player yet.
They're older, not older, mostly teenagers, who are just starting to have a hobby."
The customer is much better at the Foppi, which I will come next. The movement has dedicated a whole layer to the toads.
Customers are 70-year-olds of Parcel, photographers of tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The variety of customers is agitating, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in the previous movements: the sound of the booming of the swinging jazz instead of Wild Beasts' new life-span synthesizer pop.
None of the customers seem to be very lonely, but the perplexing psychological trauma is likely to be seen at the back of one of the 30 seconds.
Eloara, 27, has been walking around the University for a few minutes and watching some of the discs on the air.
He's more like watching than making decisions.
He says that his income is small, so making a record is not quite possible.
"They cost a lot of money.
The music is easy for a computer or otherwise, but the ease of the wine is ...", he lets go and goes on to:
"I can't change, they're so unique."
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired the number of bil fans: Urban Outfitters.
I know a bunch of teenage girls who think they're jumping on jeans, but who, on the other hand, are just going around the Polaroid cameras for a while, and I see the moment and the daughter who's thinking about buying a Crosley Recorder.
On the left there is a coin filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a combination of current music and classics, central plates for any average collection.
You don't look at the wall, perhaps because they're just the interior element and part so high that you don't even even touch it.
They are pure "art viyl" content.
Given that all the means of receiving attention to these records may require more money for the industry and send some customers to search for Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that the population, which is most likely to have more time and more than most, is at the same time the one who spends most of the money on public goods, such as dumpsters.
Although my research shows that youGovin's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of collectors and vinyl fans, which are currently available in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely involved in school or working life.
I'm sure they're not going to spend their Thursday mornings playing at the Berwick Street record store, browsing records and avoiding the television driver's 30-year-old, who stares at the fears and looks at the mean-old men with no bad eyes.
Holkeri or ice cream is the most remote in life – video report.
Investigations have shown that the world's largest ever-rounder is ice-cold.
According to Haijaja Julius Nielsen, the oldest achilles were found in study 2-2-12 years; this was a female of a length of five metres.
The Court of Justice has jurisdiction in respect of the disposal of Articles trades.
The Court of Justice has rejected the request from the Calais authorities, in which they demand that tens of the temporary shops and restaurants be opened up at the practitioner, which is inhabited by some refugees.
At this hearing, the Calai authorities raised claims at the hearing that the state should have an intention to build up a temporary shop for refugee camps. Goods sell various goods from tobacco to energy drinks and provide hair cutters to the residents of the camp. At random restaurants, they can buy 50 cents or basic food for a few euros.
According to Calais's prefects, these trades and restaurants must be decommissioned because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the black economy and because they involve fire and hygiene risks.
The humanitarian groups informed the court that trade and restaurants are essential to the camp, since the free-at-home prices offered by the State Aid Organisation and other parties are not sufficient for the camp's still existing population.
In addition, temporary shops and restaurants often provide protection and information for people who need them.
Lille's Court ruled that there were no legal grounds for deportation of the 22 dealers, but considered Calais's prefect to be "except for the fullest reason".
According to Judge Jean-François Mola, there is much more to be done with food, coffee and food than there is only for people who "live in extremely unstable conditions".
He says they provide peaceful places where parents and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places at risk was the camp's Jungle Book Kids, which is non-profitable and offers 200 times the UK, English and French hours and shelter for hundreds of unattended minors whose position is the most vulnerable.
Over 10,000 people have asked for an address in which a child can stay at a cafe.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, closing it would be "for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
The charity, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimates that after a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen record, to over 9 000 people.
In Finland, food prices are falling more clearly than in the EU on average in Finland.
In Finland, it is cheap to be strictly satisfied and upset by the public.
Food prices have fallen by nearly five per cent in Finland in three years, while the average price in the EU countries fell by one per cent.
At the same time, in Germany and in the new world, food has become one of the most expensive in the world.
In the last three years, food prices have fallen in Finland in the second most of the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
Compared to the United Kingdom alone, the price of food has fallen more than in Finland.
In the article published in the Tieto & Trentit blog by Ilkka Lehtinen, Head of the Centre, please refer to the article published by Ilkka Lehtinen.
The Court compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the general trend of consumer prices.
The latest data will be this year's summer.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose.
In the years, the prices fell close to the price level of the year.
It was an alarming situation.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtän.
After which the food has come to be a little bit of a year since then.
Now the price-intensive Russian import bans on food, which have prevented food exports from Finland to Russia, are being imposed by Russia.
The supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the prices of production have decreased.
"The policy of the clean has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term," says Lehtän.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to a fall in price.
The large trade chains the S-group and Soko have both calculated their prices.
For the second time, the price competition has been seen as a show of promotional campaigns.
As a matter of fact, Europe is not really a cheap food provider, even though the price of food has fallen.
In 2015, Finland was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, which had the same level of pay as Finland.
According to the paper, the price of food sold in Estonia is significantly affected by the price of food.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same percentage, Finland would sell the third lowest priced food in the same way as the third country.
The country compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the percentage of value added tax was equal to seven, only the Germans and the Dutch would be cheaper food than the Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries at the price of food, we must halve the EU average and continue the price competition", Green Paper.
The paper notes that the percentage of value added tax he has calculated is indicative.
Not exactly in practice anymore.
If you come to a school, you may notice that there is something going on at school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed, which will be used at the beginning of the 1st semester in all primary schools.
It is the rule that every school in Finland operates.
You decide on your own details, but the way to describe the official objectives.
The new instructions have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old instructions in many ways.
Among other things, the training of writing is given up, and, on the other hand, there is a process of coding in schools.
The teaching starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and the learning of social education begins at the fourth grade.
The Commission's proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
It used to be thought that the teacher would teach the students, but now everything should be active and learn from each other.
In this way, you need to make fun of school more interesting than this.

The figures make it the longest penalty in the world.
In the field of science, it is only passed by an Islamic shrub, which has been scheduled for 507 years.
The Greenland sharks are swimming along the North Atlantic.
It also holds another record: they are one of the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch the dogs further, they can still be more than five metres away.
As the growth rate is slow, the rate of follow-up is only about a centimeter per year, and some adults have already been living for a while.
How can we not be sure?
Mr. Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
The most important of the two women in the icefish, who remained in the fisherman's fishing zone.
The age of fish was revealed by the radio navigational investment of plaice lenses.
The average time of the search was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fishes in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
As it has been found in previous studies that the ice-cream equations only reach sex maturity by more than four metres, researchers calculated that they were in fact about 150 years of age.
The study was conducted.
Stockmann's dismissals for almost 300 sellers will not be reduced.
Almost 300 members of a commodity company from Stimman.
The joint ventures in the troubled society ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of these discussions, about 300 jobs, the main part of which will take place on termination," Stockmann explains in his information report.
According to it, the number of sales of goods will not be reduced so that the consumer service does not charge.
In addition, about 80 employees are offered a new job.
The total number of employees covered about 3,000.
At the beginning, the measure was estimated to be approximately 380 people.
A small reduction is expected to take place in the next 20 years.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme which is intended to cover the savings of 50 million this year.
On the back there are the difficulties of Stockpiling to make the goods trade more profitable.
In the second quarter, the Group’s adjusted operating profit improved to EUR 11,1 million, still losing goods.
According to Lauri Vejalainen, the CEO of the stock office, Lauri Vejalainen, sales in the sales sectors have not served the purpose of setting up a company.
"Personal reductions are unfortunately necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail performance in 2018", Vejaläinen explains in the notice.
Against the backdrop of the second quarter's performance improvement, the success of the chain Lindex was still good.
Ketju achieved its best second quarter turnover and profit in all times.
The net sales of Lint increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year's total Stockmann Group operating profit amounted to 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will change from last year.
The revised operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.

Which public sports team is exciting a strange explanation of the doping scandal of coaching coaching.
Anzra was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it turns out that Anzra appeared as a national team athlete in doping tests.
The news agency AP told us that the athlete, when Anzrah tried to appear, is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Who's national team member Stephen Arac Sou told us that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had given a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials came to the authorities of Anzra.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home, where he "promised his crime against each of the national troops".
present as an athlete, gave a sample and even issued documents.
This is not acceptable", President Kip Kein, of the Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kenya, called on the news agency Reuters for information.
Olympics' public sport begins on the other side, and Rothini is scheduled to run right at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was established last year in the World Championships in the fourth quarter and has pre-empt Rio’s winning services.
According to Reuters, the source of the activity in Kenya's public sports team was the fact that Anzrah was driving with a sportsman's accreditation card only to get free meals in a small town.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was a sportsman and he was taken to the test.
The director did not explain to the officials because he was afraid he would reveal himself," he said.
All right?
The public sport platform is empty.
You all right?
At least not at Rio's Olympic Games watching the general public.
In Rio, a struggle for public sports medals began in the first place, but the world's top people have found their skills confusing for nothing to look at.
Rio’s organisations once again reported that only 58% of the first-day flags of the morning contest and 65% of the flags of the night competitions were sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was bulging about the cheering crowd.
The flags of the waves are already sold out in Rio.
The absence of Olympics at the Olympics in Rio has already attracted attention to public sports before.
For example, there have been thousands of empty parking spaces in Rugby, Melon and Organization's views.
At the same time, the American goal was Talita Antunes and Larissa, playing the beach volleyball in the legendary Copacabana, only 70% of the audience was full.
After the second two, the Netherlands played against Russia, and it was now about 30% of the 12,000 views.
At least the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far away for European and Asian competition tourists, and many of the Olympics are far-fetched to Brazilians.
I mean, even the first game of the football team couldn't get caught up in the football stadium.
Mario Andrada, a contestant informant, told us that 82% of the ticket had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There is still 1,1 million left for sale," Andrada said Reuters.
Eightty-five million tickets to the London Olympics were sold at 8.2 million, even though the flags cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have been around EUR 9 from the openings to over EUR 1 000.
Half the ticket costs less than EUR 16 per ticket.
At the Olympics in London, volunteers and military staff were sitting empty, but in Rio, this is not yet allowed, because the organisers need money and are trying to get tickets to sell from the moment to the moment.
Indeed, in Rio, the organisers have given 240,000 tickets to less known types of school in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places on the Rio stadium this afternoon.
Even the beach volleyball on the Copacabana sand has not been interested in the audience.
Yukka Messalo threw up in London in 2012.
That's enough for a little magazine.
New ways of protecting nature - right to land
Helsinki Foundation will participate in nature conservation by new means.
Founded last year, the Foundation acquired ecologically important sites.
After that, private, corporate and community entities can redeem their rights to the country with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land area from the Gulf.
The territory is actually divided into a series of caves that can be acquired by those who wish to acquire a right against payment.
The fisherman gets a power of 184 square times the size of the whole chain, which means in fact that it is not necessary for any person to have an agreement, if the use of the land is to be changed.
The administrator's rights can also be acquired for more than one log.
Acquisition of control is something concrete that can be submitted as an inheritance or a gift.
There is no need to go back to the banders or chains somewhere else to hold on to the nature", the right to acquire all of Juha Leviekiri is based on the facts of Juha Leviekiri.
The right-holders will receive accurate location information, which will allow them to visit the area, for example.
On the Foundation's website, the names of the rightholders are displayed on the same map as the data on the land area.
The paper sees the nature of its procurement as a risk only because the Foundation's activities change from its original idea.
The Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest designed to promote the environment and the environment.
It is a matter of fact that the Foundation would act in some ethical or scientific way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Manager project is nature conservation, so that they cannot be touched and in peace.
A foundation for the acquisition of land by purchase or sale of land.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial ownership by its founders.
The foundation is intended to provide more protection for the countries concerned.
It also aims at Finland's external borders and creates immigration from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will review its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market on 13-19 August.
The cyclists torture the largest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your home.
Bike thieves torture Turkey, the worst of the major cities in the world.
This year, more people have been stolen in proportion to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the bicycle thefts reported to the police, the number of major cities in January to August this year have stolen bicycles and parts thereof per thousand inhabitants.
In addition to Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose at the top.
According to the police, from four to five bicycles per thousand inhabitants, four to five bikes per thousand inhabitants.
On the other hand, in Espoo and Kouvola, the police were informed only about two bicycle return periods per thousand inhabitants.
After all, it's a difference.
"In other cities, relative to the number of inhabitants, there is a double number of thefts compared to others," says Tommi Reen, Inspector of the Board of Governors.
The police are wondering why the city is at the top of the road.
It is extremely clear to understand why more people in Turku have been stolen than elsewhere.
I have no answer for that.
"The frequency of inspections can be influenced by the amount of traffic in the city and the number of plays at all", worked by Chief Officer Teemu Äkäs.
The Tommi Reen of the Board of Directors is waiting for Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top of the line.
To a large extent, the amounts of circular theft go according to what are the cities of study and trade.
The market has a solid center, short distances and lots of spins for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different city, where the centres are at a distance now and the bicycle is not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
A little less bicycle theft has occurred throughout the country in January to August than in the previous year.
There is still no subject for joy.
Over the last few years, more than 20,000 bicycles every year become aware of the slowdowns.
It means 50-60 filers every day and only in Helsinki for about 4,000 days.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more shots, for only a part of the victims are reported to be in custody.
Reen calls on people to report a crime on a round-the-clock basis, at least every tenths of police reports.
The typical cleared bike theft is one where the police get information about the theft immediately and the thief gets caught in a carnage.
"There are also cases in other investigations where a case of a drug case in the house may be stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught on a weekly basis in the course of their activity or in connection with a police investigation, says Chief Officer Tim Leppämäki.
He believes that the wheels are being stolen from, for example, the bicycles, the inner courtyards, the warehouses and the wheelchairs, i.e., all the places where they are usually stored.
For one of the bike models, the most recent way to save Joki is to take care of Joki.
The U-lock gives the wheel better protection than many other locks.
Some of them take the bikes for their newest modern use, but most of the stolen ones end up in the store, for example, by using them.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it has not been known that stolen wheels would go almost abroad," Reen says.
The shoppers of the stolen rivers are, according to their opinion, common Finnish.
I'm sure you can buy a part of the stolen bike without knowing it.
Some might have doubts about it.
The shoppers who have been visited must be careful, as they may commit a crime of hiding or an offence.
"The alarm bells should ring, if the good 15 wheels come to light," Reen says.
Official of the Agency Severin Hírvi makes sure to use the colour scheme Nopssa always for his working day in Helsinki, Finland.
He's had five wheels, but no one's been stolen, Hiri says. "He hasn't been taken, there's a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so tempting to thieves, this is not necessarily a hipster's," the Helsinian Hirvi was wondering.
The quick-to-reacher in the Kiosk in Helsinki, Kallio, has a small U-lock on his bike.
Now the wheel has turned against the wall of the swing, but in general Valve locks the wheel to a fixed one, such as a wheelchair.
"There is a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing I have to do," says the Helsinki student on his bike, whose body alone is about five hundred euros.
"All the time I hear from my friend that I've been taken."
"Mostly bad guys, like the bad guys."
The house was stolen from the house.
Although the bike had missed, Valve was able to wait for it to be anaesthetized.
Less than 15 years of responsibility for any of the following:
experimenting with a familiar peerlighter from the United States
In Helsinki, so-called peer-lighting is being tried to prevent people from becoming involved in the criminal cycle.
The experiment is initially applied to persons under the age of 15, who are now leaving without criminal liability.
The peer-review team is short on one of the young people's goals.
The idea is that a peer-lighting team will discuss the incident with the offender and impose a fine.
The victim of the week later may himself be involved in the peer-reflecting crew in order to compensate for his actions.
The consequences may be, for example, a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director General, says that the model is not tight.
We also have other models that are used in parallel.
"All young people are directed towards a more responsible direction so that everything does not go missing from the second mistake," says Latio.
The reference fleet has been sampled from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after the first few years, the child does not have to be in the position of an adult body, but reflects with about the same age.
_Other Organiser
The following service editor of the Palmu service office, Mr. Kaikka Lovio, tells us that this was an attack, which was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first crimes of the people under the age of 15 years may not have been committed before.
"It's been a message that you've been on your way," Lovio says.
The reference lighting is part of the Helsinki project for Immigrant Youths, which is based on the city and Me-digy.
It stresses that new policies are needed for everyone, not just for immigrant young people.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to end the Trump campaign fund.
Over 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the Party to withdraw the financing of Donald Trump's presidential election.
The letter was published by the United States newspaper Politico, who had given a statement of this.
According to the paper, the letter was addressed to the President of the National Committee of the Republics, Justice Priebus.
Signatories will allow the party's money to be directed to the United Nations elections instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his indifference, inability and record disadvantages threaten to bring about a vote for the voters in the election," says Politico.
Only the direct transfer of all funds to the political elections can prevent Republicans from drowning the Trump-decorated anchorage of their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be possible, as the chances of Trump being able to help the presidential elections become smaller every day.
Polico writes that the letter is to be sent next week.
Among the signatories are the politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who have written a letter is apparently Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "the people who are entitled to the majority of the defence" and that it is not a case of support.
The paper reads a number of Donald Trump acts that are believed to have offended many voters.
He is also said to have shown severe authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this year, 50 national security officials announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton allows relief for families with children in the United States of America.
United States Democratic Prime Minister Hillary Clinton told me about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to be president so that the economy can go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy can go well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
Clinton's plan is based on a massive, 2,000,000-dollar five-year programme to improve the U.S. infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This is in particular the case of real tax increases, in particular by means of private money.
The work programme is a hand allocation to the other south-westers who suffer from the transition of factories to low-carbon countries.
Clinton called for more investment in paid jobs after World War II.
We are a nation of builders, we must return to build.
Clinton said so.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like he was at least stressing from Alliers that real people should pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States for tax purposes, it will have to pay taxes, Clinton says.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which is supported.
"As President, I am opposed to all trade agreements that act against employees or wages", Clinton promised.
According to recent speculations, the Washington Post magazine, prior to Clinton's speech, stated that Clinton was going to criticise the public economic programme of Republicans Donald Tru on Monday, that "it only favours millionaires like this".
In the past, Clinton has previously named the "Trump loophole" as a "Trump loophole" to the company's network.
Thursday, Clinton insisted that he was the father of a small entrepreneur himself.
It reminded me of hearing about small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has failed to pay, and about the clothes Trump himself manufactures in the USA and the USA.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton was saying.
The signs of Rio's viewer are: The little ones have not glued Finnish to the screens, but the mobile application is important.
Usually, commercial competitions see television viewers as sharp mountain peaks.
Rio Olympics have not yet reached high audiences.
At the same time, the trackers have glued up to 12 per cent of the population at the top of the squares: Tuesday night swims followed by 615 000 viewers from the Yle Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For the purpose of comparison: one month's annual public-public-public-sports EM competitions received almost 800,000 viewers on TV2, and one month's European public-sports competitions were fair to one another.
So far, most of the Olympics have been interested in Sunday night biking and the 5th day of the competition, which has opened up the competition, which has reached almost half a million viewers at the Olympic Channel at one time.
Panu Pokkinen, head of sports, is pleased with the numbers of viewers, and points out that the viewers will be divided into several different instruments at the Rio Olympics for the first time.
In addition to television, the Finns will be following the next Olympics from Rio Areena.
I am pleased to see how much of the TV coverage is generally elected by the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are distributed to TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
Rio Olympics are the first sports competitions Yle has owned a whole network of channels.
When the mission arrives 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 50,000 all the time, that's a good idea.
The ratings are lower than in 2012 in the London Games or 2008 in the Beijing Games, but the difference in time - a large proportion of Rio's broadcasts will be in Finland during nighttime.
The second reason for a mild opinion - if someone now thinks it's thin - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: If Finland had taken a surprise medal from the early fights, the interest would have bounced up the top of it.
In addition, public sport is still in the process, as is the case with other Finnish interests: sailing and accounting.
The starting figures have been close to Poknen.
When the general public starts, the numbers of viewers explode.
Yle launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile application for cats, which, on the first days of the competitions, went up at the Apple App Store for the most free-charged applications in Finland.
The application for land use had been loaded 10.000 times.
I'd bet we're already on our way to 200,000 downloads.
"Very good viewer numbers will be used until later", says Pokkinen.
Rio Arena has not worked for all users on purpose.
Positive says that feedback has come and errors have been corrected.
The use of Rioarena has been accompanied by delays and other minor problems at the beginning.
Applications have produced updated versions that should correct errors.
Rio Olympics will be seen on the Yle channel and in the arena more than any other sport event ever before.
Some species may be monitored by the Yle Fem channel, and Yle Põe cares every day on the Internet.
The Olympics are not only likely to be working for the above, but also the only ones that can be followed only by the above channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sport will be visible both at the Upper and at the market channels.
How deep is Finland's deepest lake?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is the Päijänen, whose depth is at the Crossback 95,3 m.
It may be even longer.
The technical language trainer Matti Kannela found on the cross a publication of about 20 metres from the base of which the Diving Computer showed 104 metres.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency was intended to strengthen its efforts by all means.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of 100 meters, says Development Engineer Jari Ha Kala.
So far, therefore, the full depth is still 95,3 degrees.
The deep lakes are Inarijärvi (1992) and Suvaswater (90 metres).
Saimaa, secondary waters and Lakes are more than 80 metres away.
It's not exactly as much as it's a Päjäjätte.
The bottom of Inarijärv has not been specifically mapped.
"That could be a good way to hide unknown depths," Kannella asked.
If the deepest lake with the help of the center, it is the Great Lakes, 23 metres.
In this way, your Päjäjä will not be able to get into the 10 deepest groups, and Suvasvesi will be even further off the top.
Corrigendum 12 August at 14.29: Last modified in which the mean value of the midnight was wrong.
Immediate tax burden: Pensioning is becoming more and more intense
Pensioners' incomes are becoming increasingly tighter than wage earners.
I admire the fact that this was the case during the parliamentary elections and that the payment of pensioners was promised to be equal to employees.
The government statement is not included.
We believe that that is what we believe to be.
The promises made should be continued after the election, he says to the Western Media.
This year, wage and salary earners came to work income reductions that would reduce labour costs.
In this Parliament, I was briefed by representatives of the Opposition, who were concerned about the choices made by Alexander Stubbi (co.) to finance the financial crisis.
The purchasing power will be secured, it will not increase.
According to Minister of Finance Petter Orpon (Kok.), one of the priorities of tax reductions is, in my view, primarily to safeguard the purchasing power and not increase it, as next year's wages will not be increased.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on leverage and employment if other things do not increase human uncertainty.
It is a pleasure to welcome Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) and Orpo's messages for the purpose of respecting the agreement reached with great effort.
He says that respect for the Treaty is important for credibility..
It is a regular economic and economic activity.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be shaken by reason of doubt.
It will be necessary because the economy is so much on domestic demand and on the basis of human future religion.
In the case of a change in the length of unemployment in the case of a change of circumstances, a change in the rate of unemployment may occur.
Admirable appeals to the government that it would be in a budgetary crisis to stop unemployment, at least to stop its growth.
In addition, there were about 17,000 more persons unemployed than in the previous year.
He says that if you don't stop, the target employment rate from the increase to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of longer-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large fall in society.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims known to be made aware of the attacks in the country.
At least four people were killed last night in this country and last summer.
The Embassy calls on Finns on the ground to be vigilant and to avoid the most urgent tourists and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no need to withdraw from the country for explosions, but you should follow the instructions from the embassy on the grounds of prudence, says Mr. Westphalen.
Very few Finnish people in the Netherlands.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finnish people in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to evaluate.
The Finnish travel period in Thailand is scheduled for the calendar year.
Most of the tourists in the country come from South Europe and from China to this day.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from the Finnish people in Thailand through Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has been trying to seek out Finnish information in particular on Hua Hin.
Several of our staff at Hua Hin are currently absent.
In general, everything seems to be okay, Westphalen says.
No reason for the event
According to Westphalen, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
The Ambassador thinks that events may be related to the political unrest of the Thai society and the last week's referendum on the constitution of the Soviet Union.
The law is put to the vote.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were kept who reported their opposition to the law were kept.
In the southernmost provinces of the country, the principle of ethnic conflict in the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims can add to the right of self-determination.
However, the latter has not been extended to commercial relations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
Here's where the queen's birthday and mother's day will be celebrated.
Transport in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the day’s flow so that they are very accurate.
Police in Thailand: The search is not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, says the Thai police office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day, when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as tourists' favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
Even in a popular tourist destination, a holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs last night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current actions, they did not require the death victims.
Remove two explosions according to a magazine on Patong Beach.
Two bombs exploded in Pang Nga, where one person was wounded.
The first tourist destination in Hua Hin has, according to the local authorities, exploded four nights and today.
At least one killed in both double-bombs September.
In addition, in the south of Thailand, in Surat Than, and in the town of Trang, at least one ring exploded in each of them.
At least one person died in each attack.
Surat Thani is also known to several tourists, as it is transported through Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao to the tabloids of Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The source of the attacks is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, head of the General Military Directorate, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to sneeze people anymore, he told journalists.
According to Deputy Security Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He said to Mr B.B. that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country, because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the most urgent tourists and to follow the instructions of the public authorities.
There is no reason for Finland to withdraw from the country for the purpose of the explosions, but there is no need for immediate instructions on the precaution, says Westphalen.
In the open Europe, we have a lot of people.
So far, very little is known about the blows and their victims during the summer.
Last night's attack on Hua Hin has brought you more information.
There was still a local woman and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
The number of wounded is at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian.
At least three people were injured in the most recent attack by Hua Hin.
The bomb exploded in the vicinity of the well-known bell tower.
The Thai PBS says he's isolated Hua Hin, where he believes one more time.
According to the governor of the province, the Palace of Surat Than had been hidden in the florists.
At the time of the attack, the government worker was killed.
The wounds are at least one.
The chief of police interviewed by CNN tells us that there were also two bombs in the Surat Than attack that exploded about half an hour ago.
According to Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States of America won the four fourths.
The United States of America Raisman was the second point of 6.4.98 and the Russian Alija Mustafina was the third of 58,665 points in performance.
Biles, 18, reaching out to Rio's little ones for more telematics periphery, jump and boom.
Bales has been in control of women's gymnastics for the past few years.
In the last three months, the two personal worlds of the world.
He has won the fourth and final championships three times in a row, both in the last year and the second year in a row.
On the team, Biles has won two team competitions in the world of the world.
Slower MM dimensions at the Party are jumping and from the Pole.
In the Netherlands, the Finnish ombudsman: "The person has no influence on the change".
Esa Huovila, who runs the Space Intermediary Office in Phuket and a children's play club in the same country, has not been concerned about the impact of the Thai bombings on the ground.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think that this will result in anything more amazing, estimated as a Finnish attorney in the United States for about twenty years by Huovila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen near many of Thailand's tried tragedies.
There's always something.
There was a tsunami at first, then something, and then last year, a bombing in Bangkok.
If none of these former tourists have been deported by tourists, that's the way it is.
Höjtlan's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Hula heard a blow from her own work.
The employee called about 9:00 a.m. and said that there was no reason to come to the office.
Hula says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early because of the attacks.
Where I work most often at work, my local staff will be able to work at the workplace in a way that is usual.
They thought that the roadblocks had been set for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and celebrates the festival in Thailand.
On Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to allow about an hour and a half of local time.
Many on the beach had not even heard about the attacks.
Half-time in the Thai time at Patong the traffic was normalized and most of the stores had opened their doors.
According to the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovla, who visited the site.
Later, the car in question was seen in the Krusty at Jouxomini.
When the police arrived, the car had been set on fire.
The patrol detected two man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-man-to-six.
Hold on one second.
The second one got away, but the man was found later in the forest by a cop dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and serious damage to the vehicle.
Thank you for the clues.
The Executive Director of the Executive Director of the Joint Undertaking on the changes to the Director-General of the Joint Undertaking: Clear decommissioning.
In Russia, one of the most senior executives in the years when President Vladimir Putin separated the head of his administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is the Estonian 44-year-old Aton Vaino.
He's an ex-deplomate and he worked as the second man in Ivanov.
The Kangaspuro says that the reason for the separation of Ivanov may be that Putin's desire prevents you from being able to understand too much power around him.
adding that the recycling of management tasks is one way of exercising power.
This is the way to prevent people from bringing that power to power.
There is also a possibility that Ivanov may have been involved in any conflict with other officials or screwing up.
Instead of the fall in Ivano, Ivano.
Ivanov, an insider of the Putin, is moving to specific tasks in the field of environment and transport.
On a tape produced by state media, Putin proposed a joint decision to convert it into a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself was a different shift to other tasks and suggested that the Empress be replaced, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from the point of view of Ivanov, this is a clear de-position.
Environment and transport are not very high in the current situation.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
Ivanov has also played an important role in the president's Security Council.
Ivanov joined Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but the president was Dmitri Medvedev.
The Kangaspuro points out that the old map, such as governors, has been replaced in recent times.
Senior Researcher Katri Pynnyniemi from the Institute for Foreign Affairs says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's location is that Putin is going to be closer to the younger one.
Isis fighters used civilians as human shields for their withdrawal in Syria.
They used civilians as a human being in their escape to the town of Jarabulus, so that we would not aim at them, said Sheikh Darwish, a representative of the United States Council of Manbij.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the population was located in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last year, Arab and Kurdish fighters came to control about 90% of the importance of Fathers from Manbij.
However, it is estimated that tens of jihadists remained in the city at that time.
Updated at 7:30: At the beginning, we were wrong to say that civilians were on the run from home, in fact the Isis fighters kidnapped the civilians on the run.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's paper publication agenda is illegal.
The Ministry of the Interior's order to the public is a legal act, according to Professor of Public Law Tomi Voitulainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
It tells STT that the document can't be based on the authority's own law but is based on law.
The Ministry of the Interior refused earlier to release the Minister of the Interior's appointments to the Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the basis of the instructions of the Government Office and the fact that the information had been recorded on a daily basis rather than on a database basis.
The Executive Director of the Ministry tells STT that there is a marked need to reform practices in the ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio.
Last year, Bolt has been running out of value competitions for a while.
He hurt the early part of his life and had to skip the Jamaican Olympic Games.
This has not been a perfect preparation, but I am in much better shape.
I've done well and that's the main thing, Bolt said in his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included low-dressed samba dancers and fans.
All around the port of Utti, it follows that the Jamaican star has risen in the period of one of the public sports has been struggling with doping scandals and sledding interest.
Bolt's last defeat at the Olympics came to Athens in 2004, when he lost 200 metres at the beginning of the year 21.05.
About 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loosen your practice position.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, where he thwarted the world record and the self-confidence of the competitors at the time of the final headquarters of 9,69.
This is more likely to happen.
Later in the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career at a point in time.
The worlds that have been created in the past 9,58 hundred metres and 19,19 seconds are still in place.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is reaching 200 metres of world record and 19 seconds below, but that it will be achieved by nothing but the Olt itself.
In Salassa Bolt's battle challenger is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the 200th Olympics in Athens in 2004.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During the reign of Bolt in Beijing, it has not been lost in the finals of the value contests at any time if only one is on the way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th MM final was left by Bolt without running for a half-time.

BBC: ManU's buy-in for a gaming ban does not see in the opening of the Electoral League.

In Flow, the grandeur is a virtue.
Attractively precise criteria and ambitious visions have stabilised the position of the Flow in the international appreciation of the event that stars the world’s world’s world’s world’s world’s champions.
Flow will start in Helsinki.
Fairy-walkers have typically expressed themselves with their own personal attitude.
The main stage of artists is in the punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stylized by, for example, artificial grass and art installations.
It is always not enough for us to be just a head and a beer tent, says Tuomas Kallio, the director or director of the event.
The Flow Festival in the Gulf of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
Against the background of success is the simple question: What event do the authors want to go to?
In the event of events, it is quite different to think this way.
Often the aim is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the mandates, reports the event or the director Tuomas Kallio.
This week before the event happens, he knows that Flow will be sold out this year as well.
The aim has been to raise the number of 70,000 people in the last year by 15,000 people.
There are also a number of interesting national and foreign artists at the titles this year.
The increase in the volume is a good thing, because there's got to be something to do with it.
On the other hand, we don't want too much, because at some point, it's like a herd of cattle that's being taken on a huge track.
We don't want to.
The ideology of a successful event has been expanded for 13 years in such a way that the artificial grass in the soms area has 130 present, art installations as well as numerous points and drinks bars.
In addition to the main stage and the smaller stage, this year 15,000 people's tents will be operating as a gig spot.
Kallio admits that the event could happen again.
Maybe I'm a little crazy, but at the same time, we've been able to capture Flow's life.
If it's lost, this isn't us anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work is that even today's great visions are the way they are today.
In the early years of the event in the mid-2000s, the operation was very dependent on the support of some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the net sales of Flow's operating stock company were on average net.
This will allow you to create "crescent things", as I bring in 73 m distance between the tent and the building.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own personal attitude.
In addition to the music event, it is possible to talk about the community of trendy adults.
However, the event has not consciously deteriorated to a very fashionable stage.
The main purpose of this is to distinguish between the content and the content, above all.
Still, fashion phenomena also fit in with the world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with others, says Kallio.
One of the main stage artists this year is the legend of 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
Who has a huge group of fans in his own generation, but he is not the most popular performer of the festival, where he has indareck, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kalli, Iggy was blind because now is the time, this is on the job in Finland.
We care about everything, the future.
It's not just what's being played on the commercial radio.
The latest album is damn good and he's done some damn jobs in recent years.

At least 11 of the victims of Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The people ran up against me and said they blew up.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Swedesman Emelie Olsson to Aftonbladit.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.

I mean, Hua Hin's is the second second second bombing shot.
At least one dead and three injured.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the Trang bomb.
He told me about Hua Hin, knowingly, at least one who hadn't yet planned to explode.
According to the authorities, there are likely to be rebel troops behind the bombings, who are not concerned with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
The public authorities consider that this may also be a matter for the public.
According to Aftonbladet, recent crime-related organisations have recently been involved in trafficking in human beings.
XSML: This part of the new stand-by force is going to battle in the event of an emergency first.
In an acute emergency, military officers are called upon to act only after several months of swearing a military oath, reports the Middle Finn.
According to the head of the Defence Forces, General Jukka Sonninen, interviewed by the paper, for example, 5.5 months of service in the military, only those who are at the end of their education will be able to fight in the event of a military situation.

If necessary, the units may be used for the purposes of the transaction already during the civil service mission.
Pamela Tola received compensation for her home house.
A player, Pamela Tola, and her former husband, the CEO, Eli Waroma, have won a hard fight about the housing they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The trade price of the Collage House had been EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was discovered in the house, which resulted in a dangerous microbial growth for health.
In 2014 a couple of cities sold the apartment as a fit-for-release year.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, resulting in a loss of more than EUR 198 000 for Tola and Waroma.
The couple took care of the matter and demanded a price from the seller there.
The seller contested the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in court and court.
Court judgment in the case-law on Wednesday.
It held the judgment in force in which the sale was ordered to pay Tola and Warom EUR 10,000 for the sale of the price.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 3 for the costs incurred by the couple.
The court was justifiable about the price reduction, as some of the rental needs of the dwelling had already been known to the buyers when the sale was made.
However, according to the Court of Justice, obvious building errors were substantially more serious than what had been said.
Tola is looking for a good home.
At the courthouse, Tola told me that the couple had been looking for a good home because they didn't want to do any repairs.
He had the impression that the building had been repaired and in good condition and that it would not be against the elements mentioned in the fitness check report.
The health inspection report referred to the need for and the inaccuracy of the air and the lack of adequate management of the rain and melting water that flows along the seabed.
On the basis of these efforts, it did not appear that it was in any way an urgent matter.
Tola and Warma remained convinced that much rainwater might have to flow a lot over a few years.
Last night on February 4.
Within a few years, it became apparent that the humidity conditions in the water were much more serious than expected.
The audits carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed a microbial increase, according to the Witness, due to both the huge rainfall and the capillary increase in soil moisture.
The air contaminated by half the house by microbes could, according to the inspector's assessment, be allowed to enter the indoors, as well as through the indoors.
Healthy access, limit values above home or cross-country or cross-country skiing was found in petals from the living room, the basement stairwell, the living room, and the basement bathroom.
The terraces are built without permission.
In court, there was also a dispute as to whether the dwelling was contrary to the extended permit.
The Court held that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision of Espoo to authorise changes to the housing contract prior to the transaction.
Among other things, the steels had been built, even though there were no relevant permits yet.
Home problems were, however, a key issue in justice.
According to the court, the buyers could assume, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before, that the building would be suitable for living and that there was no need for repairs in the near future.
In the opinion of Tola and Soma, the Court of Justice did not have any real reason to carry out a wider review of the standard.
The parties have not failed to fulfil their obligation of entry, the Court of Justice in its judgment.

The book says, however, that the sound of the sound did not go exactly as planned: The top of the head would put it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only a few minutes after a night's sleep.
We had been having a good time.
I was so in jail.
The bottom of my head is in a book.
You wouldn't immediately think that it was a song on the hangover.
Although I wasn't really at my best, the other one was good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and at the top all the time.
A man’s one of the most popular facts about which the book relates happened almost two years later.
In 2013 Silpää resigned from his then career and, of course, he also ended up in the texts of the book 'Gold Gold', which was published in English in 2014.
It says in the book that the songs ordered from the Scriptures from Törmös were not like the Skullhead would have come.
The tip of the head had imagined doing a record that was telling the truth about his own life, but the words in the divorce note were not true, but it was written on the basis of a 7-day newspaper.
In the news of the newspaper Jari and the ex-loved divorce, Jari was told that she was overtly talking and drinking, but Jari said that it was full-bodied and it wasn't true.
Jari said that she was mad at the record and asked for a song, but she finally finally found out about it - and that's right.
In June, the British each voted out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters voted in favour of the difference and 48% would have stayed in the Union, even though polling week's polls predict the opposite outcome.
British economists and economic institutions were alone in favour of staying in the EU.
Although a few researchers may have disagreed with the mainstream of their public administration, there was no such thing as a single research institution or university.
The basic concept of Western politics, the subject of the recent election campaign of former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", fell apart in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when they didn't hear their voice.
They collapsed when the economy did not seem to be the real thing about politics.
The economic conflicting language of the economy.
Continue for Macroeconomics tiva in its most recent monthly survey of trade answers to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists have not been heard, because this time the voters have taken a decision on non-economic grounds.
The explanation of the economic loss of one economists is not a person's economy.
Many people still have the impression that the number of employees has been created from the number of employees, which is almost the same as the number of employees.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's out of the way.
Many also have the impression that the value of the currency would be good; it is the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economic Committee, the voters did not believe in economic arguments, because the consensus of the economicists was not good enough.
They were given equal opportunities, especially for the BBC, in which only a few per cent of economic scientists supporting the EU's difference from economics to the majority of the majority of economic scientists supporting the economics.
The EU-obnoxious vote was not interested in telling the opinion of the IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capitals about the consequences of the difference.
New combinations of letters talked about the same thing as an economic activity, trade relations, debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both heard and understood, they were ignored because the economists represent bodies with which voters do not share common interests.
Of course, academics like economists in major cities would have stayed in the EU, but in small towns and rural areas the message was not working.
Immigration is a house.
The overwhelming victory of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrants are taking your job, immigrants are pushing you to death, immigrants are taking advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
There are foreign workers in each of these collages.
How much work would there be if they left?
Each and every one of you in the waiting room can see where you are.
How much easier would it be for a British person to have a visitation period if they were not?
There are children in each school. There are children in each school.
How much easier would it be for the right British to get a job if they got rid of them?
Each municipality lives abroad.
I mean, how much more do you think they'd have if they went away?
These are economic issues.
They concern employment, housing and public services.
However, the economists failed to respond and if they did, their answers did not get any visibility.
The economists failed to explain that, thanks to some, the British have more and more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for money and social security.
Immigrants - and in particular EU immigrants - are the British general economy's net wagers and their consumption generate jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate reserve was Brecit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose investments in securities are based on the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, in Aberdeen, there was an early booking for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, i.e. the victory of the EU-resolution camp, began to be reserved for just a few weeks before the vote, in case the result was left.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their money out of the market.
As a rule, the credit institutions do not have any kind of liquid assets, but they should now be required.
We're running out of cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd day, we had 25 % of the fund's investments in cash or in cash, old says Aberdeen's only open daily daily encumbrance from the real estate fund that was the subject of the news.
According to the old age, the average would be between 15 and 20.
The value of the money at that time was 9 billion pounds.
The total value of the corporate funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number of units of real estate in nine general, says Vanhanen, of all the real estate units in the United Kingdom.
considers that the lowest amount of money in the funds was ten or even below it.
In other words, the funds reserved for Brecit in very different circumstances.
The funds closed down.
When the camp in favour of EU divorce won, Europe went.
However, less than two weeks following the vote on the market, Vanhanen reported that it was very calm.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the talk by Mark Carney, Governor of the Central Bank, where he estimates that Brexit can be a major risk to a commercial trader.
The first of the households, Full Life, was frozen.
Together, these guys took over the main ends of the Financial Times and the BBC.
Things are happening immediately between 2007 and 2008, old says.
This caused investors to become nervous.
Institutional investors remained stronger, but private investors were nervous.
The ball seemed to spin, and the fund was now in the middle of the second round of the door.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the collected cash, but it may as well remain for the next few days.
According to the old man, they didn't actually understand this, but they changed the downwards trend.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of business.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, that would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of the report was cancelled.
Since then, it has been right, and now the market has been a few very calm, says Olden.
He points out that, for example, Aberdeen’s continental European funds have not had any equivalent problems.
However, there was a lot to ask.
shouldn't be seen as an equal value to the non-residents.
In the old opinion, accounting for the trading of financial assets received disproportionate attention.
The open funds covered by the closures manage approximately four per cent of the UK real estate.
The Aberdeen lock-out lasted six days and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors called off its investors this year for the fact that it may hold its assets for the year 2017.
There is currently uncertainty in the weather, and economic growth forecasts have been reversed downwards, but the situation does not look "more important" for Aberdeen.
The most important issues now concern the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some of the real estate investors new opportunities, old points out.
The price of pounds and dollars is at least 30 years, while the market also has a 15% discount on sales at the time of the Brexit vote.
The dollarmaker can now buy up to 30 % of the value of the sale at a lower price.
There are a lot of good buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brext has brought sales to the London market for the London market.
At two o'clock, the situation didn't seem much different yet.
On the 4th day that Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for investments in Asset Management in Aberdeen, a UK real estate company in Aberdeen, woke up again to review the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's it. That's it.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, Old says in another home in Helsinki.
Going to work right away.
London City was already alive despite the office.
The TV screens in the office, which were normally turned silent, were familiar with the news, and the loud crowd was very quiet when Mr. David Cameron came by to tell me the difference between the two of them.
When the market opened, the screenshots blinked red.
It was one who never believed in his life, says the Old One.
In fact, despite the inconvenience, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate companies in the United Kingdom, after the day following the Brexit vote, or the second one after the end of the vote, did not take place.
The presence of the substance was a burden.
However, the mind was well prepared for the alternative, and that is the fact that it was in fact peaceful, Old story.
The Brexit vote started the transit process.
The man was followed by a storm.
It's a pound, it's a change of heart in Britain.
The markets were beginning to anticipate heavy bills for the UK and, in particular, for the retail market in London.
In London offices, there were up to 20% mines expected in the coming years.
Soon the United Kingdom’s real estate companies began to ice one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the muck is out of control, but there's still no doubt in the air.
It probably doesn't look like it's the last summer holiday in the old man's house in Helsinki.
It is far too early to say much about the consequences of Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference takes place and how Scotland reacts, for example.
The developments in the London real estate market have already been the first to come to light.
The information provided by CBRE by the SSS on price developments covers about one-third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In the London City office building, 6.1 per cent of the total, the old list was 6.1 per cent.
The figures are not so over-crowded, but they are months of change.
The monthly index started in 1987, and only five months have seen worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All equal values took place for the period 2007-2008.
It is interesting, however, that Brexit was almost quickly hit by the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis on the United States market.
The old man believes that the comparison is not quite correct, as it is now a British domestic crisis.
The atmosphere is another.
In the market, the market is not now seen as a whole, but as a result of the development of liquid assets, says Vanahanen.
There's always money.
The repair movement could have been ahead of us in any case.
In fact, the course of the transaction is not necessarily - could have been ahead of us without Brexit.
Aberdeen estimates that the prices of London and other world-wide first-world real estate have already been too high.
We have been saying for two years that the House and the Houses are overpriced, says the Old One.
So the positivity was getting really high.
London prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the London population as well.
The second major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is going to be globalised, says Old One.
New entrants from the Middle East and Asia have come into the market, and more and more residents and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
It's an easy place to stay.
In addition, prices have been fed by the highest ratio, which is why some employers have had to look for new sources of income.
This loan has been readily available - although, according to the old man, there is now much less than in the previous year.
Spread out, spread out.
In London, the mist came to an end last summer, Vanhanen says.
Aberdeen began to lighten his holdings in London, and last year he was a salesman.
There was a possible change, and now it came.
What about from now on?
Depends on how the British economy is developing, old man says.
There's a lot he's afraid of coming up with, but he says that there's hardly a word he'll ever be allowed to do.
The climate suggests that there is a descending or a level playing field ahead of us.
Vanhanen has already seen several movements up and down, for he has been in real estate since 1988.
And he is still an optimist who believes that the dome is understood by work.
If you are well prepared, you will be in a better position.
He believes in a far-reaching decomposition.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of it.
If the risk is solidified, the risk is also solid, old says.
The S-group intends to register for more information on how to purchase.
The S-group knows what you're eating, as the Group of Directors has told us today that it is starting to provide more detailed information on the purchases made by its clients.
So far, after the data have been collected from a monthly sum, the last item at the beginning of this week will also be harmed by the products purchased.
The group will be here in Kesko, as the information purchased with the Plus Card has been collected in the Kesko User Register for a few years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala, the feedback from the programme has been only positive.
Detailed information will be collected with the consent of the customer and used on an authorised basis for trade.
The most efficient channel is an email.
Quite a few customers have denied the use of product information, Aritala tells Economics.
According to him, Kesko is not going to react to the S-Group's integration change.
Kesko grades its client in ten chapters, according to mere purchases.
The classification is updated monthly.
The applicants are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they make.
The information is used for the purpose of targeted marketing for the customer.
Detailed purchase information is collected only from K-Group’s own chains.
Partners, such as Neste Oil, will give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a parent client program and is not designed to do so at this time.
Finland’s Middle-Easter Business has its own YÜKYSBOURUS customer programme, which can be joined in the selection houses, Sibo and Euromarkets.
At present, we do not currently have information on product or product-specific level, and we will remain at the same level as the final amount.
In other words, we know where the purchase was made and on the same day, as well as the total amount of each receipt.
We have not gone as far as the K-Group or the S-Group, Director-General of Business Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer programme will be renewed in the future, but the next item will be discussed.
However, Ora does not expect that the product information will not be processed.
Start-up visitation
Sok's customer and customer register has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, the basis has included also professional, education, housing, and the birth years and previous personal data of the child.
Persons in the same household and their role have also been registered.
The date and time of purchase, place, balance and method of payment have been saved on the S-primary purchase.
In addition, information about the S-bonding partners has been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, product purchase information is beginning to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
On the other hand, information about S-markets, Prismojas, Kodin Terrois and ABC chains is currently recorded at product level.
For a long time, customers have had expectations that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjana Saarikoski, Head of Sok's Customer Owner and Partnering.
The S-group wants to inform its customers about the change.
They may prohibit the use of factual information for marketing purposes.
In any case, the data are recorded in the balances, which is what it is, of course, not.
A candidate may check his or her data stored on the S-type website.
For example, cashiers do not have access to information, stresses Saarikoski.
Video: Heila's kid is Customs's newest dog-stamping plating will be the first explosive dog in the world.
The Laboratory's puppy is bubbling hard at five similar branches of the same country lines at the Helsinki Airport airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila sat revealed a bottle of shells that were torching to the square gas.
The waste gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security and online trade access
They will be the first person to search for weapons and explosives in Customs and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The work may take Heila and Job, if necessary, to other border crossings and ports as well as to other ports.
However, the station will be Heila's main job, as the international security situation has changed in Europe due to serious terrorist attacks.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have been confirmed at Customs and after the attacks," says Customs Superintendent Mikko Grönberg.
Access to the training of the weapons and explosive charger Customs is a transit mission through Helsinki Airport.
There are up to 40 million broadcasts per year through the increased internet trade at the airport, which may include foreign ordered weapons and explosives.
In recent years, Customs has made about 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives in the Helsinki Airport, as well as their ingredients, out of a group of online shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo.
He'll be working all over Helsinki Airport.
It will examine registered baggage and mail.
In hundreds of centuries there will be great benefits when it can go through large containers and mark the areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of this report, Tuli will continue to test the weapon and explosive symptoms in the future.
Grönberg gives the idea a positive attitude.
Monday
The education of Heila-pennu is co-ordinated by the School of Customs, which is located in the Holy See.
Heila and I are also being trained by the Defence Forces.
There is strong experience with training dogs and explosives in the Defence Forces.
Customs, together with other matters, decides which smells Heila is taught to know.
They will be further trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Colleagues at the Airport are Customs's new drug dog, household and drug dog Mass.
Laborator Heila has been chosen from the kid's kid.
The criteria for the dog chosen for the home include tearing and hunting, as well as peace, because it is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives in the country, is a close colleague to the customs inspector, but also a close partner.
No one gets home without the Viila, Suntio shows up.
The household claims go to Hela for the rest of the time.
The camera of the Illa-Sanomas makes a good dog with the camera's mike protection, but Heila will change the protection from the other side of the toy right away from the "irti" hand.
Work hard to get the job started.
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still peer tests in progress, the next October, where training is expected to be necessary for demanding tasks.
They can be seen in jobs at Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes as planned.
Passengers, unfortunately, cannot come here to iron out the work-bearing oil, the impression Suntio.
The cost of one job is about 60,000 EUR per year.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days may be longer, eight to ten hours, but each part of the job only lasts from one minute to two hours.
The owner of the work dogs is the common competition in Customs.
Second, he applied for about 20-30 Customs legs.
Got hit by a Stopo who has not had a working dog in the past, but has one dog in one year and a watchdog in Customs.
The country became its first Olympic Games - the people get their day off.
Less than a million inhabitants of Fiji from the Olympics in Rugby are so highly valued in the country that the government has scheduled for the 22nd day of August.
According to the country's broadcaster, Fiji's government confirmed the outcome of the championship.
The day off is due for the team to return home the next day.
In his own country, refugees are also allowed to have a specialty in their country.
The Fijin Rugby team has a single championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the finals in the capital of Suur, where the stadium had been screened.
Normally, only the native Fijians are excited about rugby, but this game united with our multilingual community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardin.
Dramaa in Rio - the Finnish farmer passed out after the storm went off.
The weight-weighter, Miko Tokola, succeeded at the last at a distance of 175 kg after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and literal feature for the promoter.
During or after the rises of the penalty, he has been fainted many times.
I don't really know how to say why.
Tokola was able to get 175 kilos of labour in Rio and 145 kilos of plaice in Rio.
The total result was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her job at least 175 kilos, as well as the other one.
In an attempt, the weights rose as a result of the loud screaming.
Until the court approved the lifting, the body was released under pressure.
The Finnish speaker is pleased that he has suffered from knee problems.
Prosan - Veikausliga - Illa-Sanomat - Ila-Sanomat
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, which is playing in the football league, has concluded an agreement with Albert Prosa for the rest of the year.
We're looking for our team's lead player, who has powers and means to come to Finland and Rovaniemi with a small amount of money.
Over ten players and I went through a wealth of 55 players from all over the world.
Prosa, Coach of Rops, informed Juha Mainen, was able to stand out from the crowd as a good alternative.
Prosa, 25, arriving in Rop from the Tallinburg Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals in the 109th quarter.
He has also been threatened by the Estonian national team.
Prosan is supposed to be with ROPS already on the back of the Seinajoki, where the Royals meet the Master SJK of the ruling Lord.
Ropis needed to be re-attached when last year's secular king, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
Once again, the great Modern Church encounters: the teen shorts are all about everything.
As Alex Dunphyna became familiar with the modern team, Ariel Winter is once again showing up to look for her brave body.
In Hollywood, this is where the miniswitches were described, which do not make sense for imagination.
The Shorts revealed not only the player's legs but also this backside.
Winter, 18-year-old, has recently given notice to change his or her mind and conduct considerably more courageous.
The star has posed very little in the images published in common media and has taken many tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very few costumes.
Winter has recently published also photos of itself.
If the picture is not shown, you can look at it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked the first why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
The founder and CEO of WowomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter was in the process of "typical Hollywood transformation" into a child star.
He's been on television almost all his life and he's grown up in the Cardassia period.
He has learned that what more appears to be the surface, the more public and attention Hollywood gets, the more Palmer says to Fox News, and more that exactly the same expression has been seen many times before.
The Talker started in the Modern Family series, which is only 11 years old.
The actor has been pissed off about some of his long-time fans by changing their image.
There's no idea where he's gonna be in ten years' time, when he's already doing it now, one of Winter's dead.
Some of the women fans, on the other hand, defend the actor and want to make no mistake about it.
You look sorry.
I don't care what the others do.
As an inspiration for many women, a young woman is glowing.
Policemen from the Nordic countries prefer to go to Finland - tourists are attracted by a tear fire: In autumn it is possible to see a random murre aurora.
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese native air-refoulement trips from early autumn, Visit Finland will inform you on the announcement.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Finnish refoulement journey.
Revo fires are card cards on our winter journey and are closely linked to winter and snowy landscapes.
There is a good demand for the winter revontulum in the winter, but we are now trying to increase the sales of bought-out trips.
It is rare to know that the revontuliseson begins from the early days and goes on to spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called myrror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the ripples, making the vision two times a coincidence, reports on the announcement of Visit Finland’s see President Anne Lin.
The main target group of the Visit Finland Revontulkamp is the early 25-35-year-old Japanese women living in the city who are dreaming of villages and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
The tourists are attracted to Finland by, among other things, online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from the University of Turku and Tokyo universities, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among the Japanese in comparison with the rest of the Nordic countries.
However, the Americans would like to see more unique attractions from Finland, and this revont fire, according to Lindi, has an enormous power.
In Finland, the number of foreign tourists snoring has clearly increased more than in other Nordic countries.
The following year, in Finland, they hung over two times more than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
Citizens are an interesting target group for the Finnish population, as they spend more than 80 million in Finland.
The average number of Japanese visitors in Finland was $188 a day,” says Lind.
Britain was forced to content itself with the silver rugby-7 tournament when the Fijii Prime Team won gold.
The United Kingdom's success in the seven-player rugby tournament was thrashed by a thrift when Fiji won it on Thursday in the finals played on the Rio Deodoro Stadium, with figures 43-7.
Fidzi gave a master's lesson in the sphere, in moves, lateral misfortune, in support of the game, in running lines and in raw force, and won this gold — the first Olympic medal of all its history — on Earth.
Tapio meant silver, which was much more than a fat comfort to the United Kingdom, for it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They may be proud of their success in the Olympic Games for the first time in the rugby-7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard win from the American Box in the 7–9 semifinals last day could have a negative impact on the team in the finals.
In spite of this, the Fiji team in this form would have won the thanks, even if the 15-person team had been in full power.
The United Kingdom may be comforted by the fact that at least one of the United Kingdoms will be getting a gold medal tomorrow: Fidz head coach Ben Ryan, former English Rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
Experience has been quite a bit of an experience for the United Kingdom.
Eight years ago, they lost all games in Ryan's training at the Adelaide Sevens tournament.
In Rio, they just lost the game.
The loss is painful, but progress is shocking.
Fidzi started with an excellent start and presented his taco teas to the United Kingdom as if for fun.
It seemed as if the head Tom Mitchell and his team had joined a bunch of mobile buses, and the worlds would return to 5 to 0 when Osea Kolinisau hit the corner.
When it was four minutes, Jerry Tuwai scored another goal right from the goal shot.
Situation 12-0, and the United Kingdom had hardly touched the ball.
Mill's excellent guarantee did not prevent a rational Leone Nakarawa from making a third paint, but it did not take long to pass on Fiji.
When the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Vermalua made the right angle, after which the United Kingdom was 17-0.
Nakarawa made a second goal for the start of the second goal, when the first half of the game was still over one minute.
Vatemo Ravouvou then fell into the United Kingdom team through even more powerless tackles and fell over the finish line.
During the period considered, the period considered was between 29 and 0.
It seemed like the Fijians were born with the same number four rugby, while the scriptures are still in the process of learning.
Which is much to be true of.
The United Kingdom made major changes in the mid-term and managed to hold on to the Fijian entire four minutes, which was a good performance in the first half of the year, until Joshua Tuisova made the goal of the Fijian team thanks to the excellent team.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation by 36 to 7 steps to the left of the goal for the United Kingdom, but the game had already been lost to the North Sea islands, whose fans were able to sing, swing flags and dance.
Fiji's rather cheerful attitude was hard to help without admiring.
Mata Viliame made a finish for the Fijian cake in the last minute without the finish of the finish line.
The polls, the Fijians embraced each other, and the Brits fell into the field, just being crushed.
In the past day, Fidzi had won the Japanese semi-finals by 20th and the United Kingdom had gone over South Africa at a tight semi-final where the UK goal is to solve the balance.
Brown took over the South African Box during the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the finish line with his dazzling work and ran from under the goal pole in the second half.
Marcus Watson, who is the brother of Anthony Watson, a player of the 15 player Rugby team, seals the victory and finally the silver medal.
The battle of the Valaman against cancer is an excuse for Glover and Heather Stanning to row the gold.
I'm not sure how much I feel about this is going to be a little bit of fun.
The first bet of the last Helen Glover and Heater Stanning made a deal with 220 winning bets in history and found additional purposes for all about Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were in the air, they were two, each the third coach, Robin Chiss's voice, which opened up the second consecutive Olympics in the second two, which became the first of them in the history of the British sport, which exceeded the equivalent achievement.
Their supremacy was beyond doubt, their victory was already 39th consecutive and once again record.
What we see, the two great athletes in the water, as you obviously saw, is not exactly the same as the nature of the subject.
There are a great deal of helpful hands behind each row, of which two points have been achieved, but the most important of the assistants is the coach, which 30 months ago was diagnosed with cancer and which then did not know if he would see this day.
I'm sure the situation was tight at the time.
"I had bladder cancer, and the tumor could have been cut off.
It would have spread everywhere.
it would have been a long time ago.
It changes the idea."
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was lucky that Williams was able to start his own system during the first half of 2014, when he was able to start the session, which would mean that it would not be necessary to interrupt at all if, in these circumstances, he could even say so.
"I needed money, so I had to heal quickly.
It acted as an incentive.
I was down and walked around Sections 6, 9 and 15 in between, when they said there was only one moment.
Here we go.
The war itself is already far away, but this is the bigger one."
Immediately after the victory, the two minds were on the News, which had spent more time trying to be restless.
The head of the British Royal Artillery, Stanning, who was behind the trip to Afghanistan, says: "I've been here for hours in ruins, which is probably quite understandable, but that means so much."
"It just tells us how much this means to me and how much we work together with Helen and Angel.
For the last three years, the cashiers of Helen and Robin have been fantastic.
We wouldn't be anything, so thank you so much, she's the world's best coach.
I wouldn't have hoped for a better person with whom to train, or a better coach."
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition for the last five years.
The two have gone into an overwhelming rhythm, for which their competitors have failed to draw any comparisons.
As the New Zealand and Denmark began to approach the last 500 metres, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
"We were very close in a moment.
Helen hockey "Stay with, go with,"
It is very important that you do not drive away from the route."
"We were doing well and, at the same time, we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We're not doing anything today, we're just trying to make a good fight and win the race that we did."
Two years before deciding on the future.
Glover was talking to Steve Backshall, who was familiar with nature programmes last month.
I'm just having a good time right now.
"I didn't mean to say that this was my life's life.
It would have brought too much pressure."
"After London, it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so fine, and I was very strenuous.
This time it took about four hours.
It's so much better," he says.
The transaction will change the routing government of the Paban years.
The operation will hold early parliamentary elections in late October, which are already called for in the spring by the protesters of Panama's data leaks.
The so-called Panama papers revealed the tax havens of some of the Irish politicians who have converted taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlagsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for the protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to organise a new parliamentary election at that time.
The election has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts indicate that it is difficult to know how much last spring public education contributes to the evangelical expression of the Bible.
In the June presidential election, the criticism of the captains was clearly expressed, and the political candidate Gudni Johannesson was elected as president.
The true word was sarcasmous in his claim to be the founder of Obama Isis.
The president of the Republican Republican Republic, Donald Trump, withdrew his latest speech.
He said that President Barack Obama was the founder of the organization, and that he was a party to the establishment of the Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The Democrats were angry with the speeches and asked for an apology from Trump.
The chief of the army should never be allowed to let anyone who could fall down like that, Clinton's clue.
In South France, the Mayor of Cannes has forbidden Muslims to prefer the use of a covert bubkini swimwear on the shores, including British Guardian.
In the decision taken by Mayor David Lisnard, it is said that going to beaches and swimming is the way to do, where there is no good manner and no secular swimsuit that respects bathing.
It is also said that swimming suits, which seriously express religious policies, can increase the risk of disorder in the UK, which has been the subject of a terrorist attack, may increase the risk of disorder in the UK.
In the middle of May, 85 people died and hundreds were killed in Nice, when a 31-year-old male drove into the coup d'état that was celebrating the British noon.

The quality of the bathing water in the region of Oulu has spread through a screen - in the Bay Lake, the blue-silvered dam.
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region are quality standards for bathing water.
Only the shores of Pyykisjärvi have been found to have a blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue - blue -
During Tuesdays and Wednesdays in Oulu, water samples were taken from nine EU beaches and 30 other public beaches in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coast of the coast of the sea, the concentrations of all bathing waters of E.coli and intestinal gastropods in the E.o.b. were below the limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.goli and gastro-coke concentrations of seaweed water were confirmed on Wednesday, when the concentrations had fallen below the measures.
The blueness of the water in the riverside area does not yet make the water fit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation may quickly change to a blue-hot area, where the water is made up of a blue-green resting plate.
The procedure will follow with a more frequent review.
In the event of a change in the blue tsunami for each blue people, the information on this will also be provided on the bathing report.

ETSK's Pahtane Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside of the forest owners.
The forest gift is one of the tax havens of the Ministry of Finance in the next year's draft budget.
It is proposed that the income tax Act should be subject to a tax which would be granted on the basis of a change in forest change gift.
In the Ministry of Finance, the reduction in forest supply has four objectives: to promote changes in the generation of forest holdings, to improve the housing structure of young forest owners, to increase the size of the forest and to increase the supply of wood.
The aim of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner will make a reduction in the pure income of the forestry sector.
Of course, the idea of making such a tool for developing cycle changes in forestry is good, commenting on the Central Market (MTK) of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MK) Director-General Juha Vagyrainen.
However, it is difficult to find a critical proposal for a tax change.
The balance of the honey is to be charged with the pure income of the forest owner.
It's full income, it's all gone.
In the opinion of the JRC and the Jäärajas, the effectiveness of tax reduction would be greater if a reduction could be made in a clear way about the result of the sale of wood.
The VM's proposal starts by preventing the net result of forestry from achieving a clear return on income from forestry, which should be deducted from other taxes.
A person would benefit from tax, which would not be missing at all.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is not able to visualize it, says Jajarainen.
The point is, according to him, only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit for forest value is set at EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high in the mind of Pääras.
In such a way, 82% of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the least-favoured circle.
The model would have an impact on about 10 % of the forest owner, he says.
In VM, it is considered that the border pursues the objective of buying the order.
In forest forestry, forest management has been taken for decades, according to Pähärinen.
Against this background is the ageing of forest ownership.
According to the JRC, the average age of forest owners is currently more than 60 years, and about half of forest owners are living.
The powerful raving surprises the drivers at Himanga - two cars went up into the ditch and ran into each other.
There was a special attack on the Kalajoki Himanga the next afternoon.
According to the government, two consecutive times, the car was retreaded into a ditch, after which the rear came after the previous driver.
According to Päipäjö's minister, Mr. Harri Päytä, there is no doubt that the process of being re-introduced into the ditch is the result of an entrenched covelopment.
In this time, there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no specific information on their injuries.
The driver of the driving car did not hurt the driver.
Accident occurred on the highway from 8 Spirita to a few kilometers from Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer medicines.
Recent research results by researchers at the University of Turku can help to develop cancer medicine even more effectively.
The findings made by Professor Johanna Ivaska in the study group indicate that the incidence of cancer in cancer increases the malignant nature of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as the breast tissue, are very soft, and the cells of the tissue grow like this in this environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer could be prevented under laboratory conditions by causing the cancer’s surrounding tissue to return to normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effect of anticancer medicinal products may be enhanced by focusing on the interaction between the cell and the active tissue.
The results have been published in the 4th of September book Nature Communities in Cell Biology.
The provocation of domestic death is still under way in the Court, and the prosecution is also asking for a murder conviction for another perpetrator.
The promotion of home death in the court is complete in both cases.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for domestic death in Muhoks.
For the second 8 years, he received 4 months, among other things, from a young person’s murder and gross murder.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for the murder and brutal murder of a person.
The convicted person was also convicted of serious road safety threats as a young person and of the right to drive a vehicle as a young person.
The Court of Justice was elected by the prosecutor, the prosecutors and the man who was the last convicted.
The prosecutor is asking for a lighter sentence of 12 years of imprisonment for the murder of a person who has been convicted of a criminal offence.
They were in the process of acting in a full understanding of what they understood.
According to the Court of Justice, 17-year-old young people killed a school child protection unit manager last January.
The 17-year-old, who had been attacked by a conviction, claimed to be behind the living room on the couch, sat at the manager's door.
The director had the right to take off and tossed the young one into his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a vacuum cleaner.
The director was also, among other things, strangled with leadership, punch and kick in the head.
According to the mindset, both judges were fully understood at the time of their action.
According to the court, young people were planning to escape from their home at least from the day before.
Ice is the longest in the world’s long-lived, growing at the age of only 15 years.
For the most extreme life, icefish is confirmed, reports Science magazine recent research.
In the north of Greenland, such as the ice rink that floats around Greenland, the rink can live to the age of 400.
The female growth rate is only 15 years of age.
I'm going to spend a little more time in my life that it's only a centimeter a year.
Only one shellfish is known to live longer than the sharks.
The researchers discovered the age by radio interference.
Due to the nuclear tests carried out in the 21st century, some sharks had radioactive residues.
On the basis of this, the researchers were able to assess the life of the sharks.
It is estimated that 392 years for the oldest tossed or the second tossed may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economic Agenda - News
Donald Trump's world does not change today.
Up to one third of the total tax revenue would be missed if the change in corporation tax imposed by Donald Trumpin resulted in a change in corporation tax.
Incomes would also be reduced, in particular, by the least useful tax incentives.
Trump photographed his tax programme as a revolutionary presentation in Detroit on Monday.
The corporation tax fell from 35% to 15%.
Not to raise a really high sum, 1,000 billion dollars per year.
The total income tax rate is now 39,6, after the sale of the real tax 33.
The inheritance tax will be abolished in full.
Trump accused the state of overregulation of the economy and of bankruptcy of small businesses.
The main environmental standards laid down by pipelines must be renewed and energy regulation must be strengthened.
Barack Obama's capital reform is to be re-examined.
The management must be appointed "experts instead of red tape".
According to Trumig, "damaged" trade policy is one of the most important reasons for the United States of America.
The free trade agreement should not be used.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty duty of 45% and 35% of Mexico.
We're waiting for a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our religion, Trump advocacy.
Donald Trump's world does not change today:
American cars are going to drive on the streets, they are going to come across cities, the U.S.A., and they're going to check the sea, the U.S. steel is going to be all over the country.
On the contrary, Trump truthfully went through the talk written by the helpers, even though well-founded protesters interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, will see Trump taking him to some sort of economic recession.
Hillary Clinton published his own schedule early in the second time in Finland.
Attack wave from the past - News News
The sea is fatal, but the actual wave of attack strikes the middle of Madrid's street tip - accounting with the past can start.
It summarises the story of Pedro Almodovar's new story.
Almodovar's previous job as a tour manager was a fun and rustic satirical comedy, which is also the skin where I'm going to be a career leader in the ê ê í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í í .
It is also Juliet (2016) who is located somewhere between those two works.
It is an amicable seismic, human, and family drama, the center of which is the relationship between mother and daughter.
The story is a simple game, and we're seeing a great deal of a long-term setback.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the last few days of random encounter, a new man (Dario Grandinet) may be a miracle to the end of the world.
In the form of a back and a second letter, the last time the phases of the marriage were grown up again.
He starts before the day of birth, from the moment of this day (Daniel Grao).
In the second female section, Julieta, as a young teacher, presents Adraina Ugette, a television-knowledge from the Ommelt series (2013-2014).
Ageing has been handled in a way that can be considered a bonnet, but I myself would say that it's time for a simple-to-tunnel and a simple-tunnel-to-tunnel.
For Almodóvar films, it is always fair to say that the distance to the humour of the sublime of Vieta is always fair.
It is a smooth play, quiet, placeful of good music and a very mindful film, in which there are elements of electricity in it.
On the other hand, a typical visual view of the co-director is preserved and so that it begins to give a little bit more thought to itself as a pure shapeance than a functional artificial effect.
Diseases, deaths or otherwise just sudden loss of life for people in the film, but still in the same ice.
This applies in particular to the dress: in the case of a name-named person, costumes change from one scene to another, and the same applies to the displayed baskets.
Almodóvar is well aware of this, but the main thing, i.e. the phrase of each scene, is not much better than that.
In mechanical times, the impression is external and unsouled.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript from Nobella 2013 award-winning Canadian Alice Munron based on three novels.
←it has been published in the book Hero: Reports.
Almodóvar has contributed to the dialogue, resulting in a bit of saga writing literature filming.
The facts would have been emotionally inextricably inextricably intense for even more reason, as much of the big things - especially the blatant guilt - are dealing with the subject of the film's subject matter.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Zenro Alice.
Main features: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
known as the “Employment Party” - News
No new copies will be made, daring ministers, so that the basic Finns do not completely collapse.
However, in the spring, the final operations will be done at the bulk store.
No new copies will be available.
The already decided fourth savings are sufficient.
This is how the Prime Minister, Juha Sipilä (medium) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (co.) are assured under the budget line.
In fact, it is true that there are no new treatments for VM's head, as social security cuts were decided in the spring context.
A cut of 0.8% is made in the paper, the public sector, the basic security of unemployment and almost all other interests linked to the public accounts.
The period of protection of the economy is reduced to 400 hours from 500 to 400.
The training sessions are ongoing.
Plastics are haunted.
Is it true that we are not doing new practices?
This is the first year of the year.
Kunicalas are held in July and are the most important febrile meter of the day, not the galleys.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the local government's various political parties have been ruining the public's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallars indicate that the government's basic Finns are waiting for a rickety loss, although the result of its previous elections was modest at 12.3 per cent compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the Finns received 752 new councillors, most of which next spring the price of influence in the real estate government will be realised.
The lifeline of the three about the same size as the three governments is based on the fact that the population of the basic Finns endures.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters have had enough of the government during the first year.
The first important points of the party parliamentary group's visit have also come to light.
First of all, the new replicas will not come -rectories will be puzzled by the fact that next year they will be carried out sharply and, secondly, will be used to soften the basic Finnish expected impact.
How big was 2018?
The second of all is, in fact, the other way around - if the Sipillon regime is still in operation.
The government has set itself the goal of indebtedness this afternoon, but the budget proposal for Petter Orpo will be set at EUR 5.9 billion next year, i.e. more than this year.
After the election, there are two options for you to choose from.
The first is to raise your hand in the middle of the day and admit that you are unable to comply with your own law: debt does not win or even slow down.
Another one's holding on to the program.
This means that the past is getting even tougher in the 2017 budget period.
The budget would be at least close to balance during 2018 and then spring will be held in the parliamentary elections against what will happen.
Such activities did not allow for any indebtedness.
It is very clear that in the current activities indebtedness will not be overcome, even though Juha Sipilä is trying to create a positive atmosphere.
In the event of a public awareness of the budget of Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen, the curves used by the Secretary-General of State to prove it in opposition to:
The growth projections of the global economy have once again proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not yet risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy in the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% this year and has been extending from the average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Employment is now higher in the year.
On a weekly basis, general government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the mid-term of next year.
is responsible?
On the day of October 2015, the Commission rejected the Commission's decision, which was considered irresponsible.
The maintenance of unemployment next year will cost around EUR 3 billion, which is actually covered by the new debt.
This is a central, assembly and basic Finnish idea of what is responsible.
Question: When you want to leave a lot of work to do.
Four of them believe that the organisation of day-care, work and physical activities of the child are the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the study conducted by the Two Municipal Development Foundation (KOKS).
The majority of the people also hold a responsibility to one municipality for books, culture, citizenship, building supervision, university education and waste management.
In turn, the responsibility of the county is to be more clearly expressed in terms of county planning, specialist care, vocational education, vocational education, universities of applied sciences and institution for the development of the disabled.
None of the tasks performed by the municipalities in line with the law are intended to be transferred to the State.
The underage drunkard ran away from the chase at the end of the chase.
A 16-year-old biker drove a police patrol to run away in Joensuu at Ilomantsiti on one hour.
The police were trying to hit the bike without lights, but the man went on to run away with a fair overrun.
The rear-wheel drive went to the Sokajarandan road, which was still on the Sorronaho and the lower forest road, where the motorbike ran out of the way.
After that, a young man ran off running away, but a fast-legged police officer ran off to the runaway.
The pilot-in-chief test for the driver showed 0.75 promos.
I also didn't have a driver's license that would have changed the way the bike was driving.
The case is being investigated, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was on the steel cargo fell into the ditch.
The truck that was in the rock truck fell into the ditch at 11:15 p.m. on Pölkijärvi on Cavinti on Thursday night at 11:15 p.m.
The truck had driven left in a curved bend out of the road and fell half into the ditch.
The rescue service lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door, along with the life-jackets staff and first-hand nurses, through the door left behind.
It was left to the owner of the car to pick up the vehicle.
The truck from the henhouse hit the road with hydraulic oil that was absorbed by the fire department into the peat.

Great power elements in the air - see the photogallery about the destruction of the Parafest.
The tents of the Para-festivals have been torn down by the flow of floods caused by massive destruction.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parasitic Association, estimates that the festival will be financially well established, and the event can also be held next year.
The most recent performer Kalle Salonen appeared at the end of another evening in the hands of the Republic of Austria.
On Saturday, the program will be running with presentations in the public theatre facilities starting at 13.00.
The Art Centre in Ahjo will be at Parafest at 13-15.
A plan is being made to plan.
The fluctuation is determined in the rain cloud when the rainwater and its weight are driven by a falling airflow.
The changes in the condition of the wet-pillar water bind to heat and therefore the falling air cools and its speeds towards the earth are accelerating.
The Atmospheric Science Department is informed that the current flows occur during the summer.
The path of the encyclopaedia is just a sign.
The lost flow struck the back yard of the Joensuu Art Museum as the location of Parafest before five this afternoon.
The three tents fell down, the tents had a total of about 200 people.
The accident hurt herself slightly by four people.
With one child who was slightly injured in further treatment.
Smells of aging weather in London
According to the survey, the skin of the Londonian population is older than usual.
It's air pollution.
The British study is presented by Eveninging Standard.
The smart home care company Caci introduced London air into the most toxic small particles and their fat.
The results show that many people in life are two and a half years old, as are those living in rural areas.
Aged small particles of skin are very high dust, which originates from the transport of fuel.
The same components also cause vital disorders that, according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 lotomas die each year.
The studies have found that the particles are small enough to penetrate the ultimate layer of the body.
Cacin’s investigation found that early ageing is a risk especially for those who are walking on their way to work in the vicinity of busy streets.
The residents of London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example by wearing a variety of masks, but regular cleaning is recommended for a more detailed decision.
The brakes of the tractor failed to see the
The man had been ironed in his yard with stones on the tractor.
After he had got out of the tractor and gone past it, the brakes of the tractor were broken and the engine poured on the man.
He did not fall under it, but, however, he was chasing the same man to the extent that he was transported to the Central Hospital in serious harm to the follow-up investigations.
The tractor didn't want to go any further than that, as it affected the stones that were in front of it.
I'm going to be able to do this again and again in the future.

Anne Jumppanen has been playing only in all the Salibandy World Championships since 2003.
Now we're going to have the sixth race, only in 2013 between the best in North America since Canada.
I was at work and playing with women around the world when I saw the announcement.
The United States was setting up a salibandy national team.
I was interested and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
The 40 was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth, New York.
It's been a year.
In 1987, in the University of Joensuu, Japanese entered the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I come to Joensuu, such a form is not yet played at the MS level as a salibandy.
The wire was played in college.
I played in Katjaja with a ball and later in the Jockey game in the SM series, Jumpanen remembers.
With the university, he played the salibandy SM series for the period 1991-92, three times went to Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the club's A-trutt at the championship.
The SM series peaked in silver.
In total, Jumpan played through the 10 series of SMs, the balance was accumulated in the 169th quarter of 51+34=85.
The latest MS period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Võhänen were appointed to the national team.
Josban, the Josban of the University of Joensuu, was raised by Perttu Puska and the Eno-based Tatu Väänänen in the Finnish national team, which played in the Czech Brnon EFT tournament on 6-8th and 6th September.
In Helsinki, a 25-year-old Perttu Puska has been playing this game before the 9th Earth War, where I have accumulated power points 9+4=13.
The 32-year-old Beléen Wiler-Ersigegin defender Tatu Väänänen has arrived and arrived at the country's standard data base, which includes 117 countries, with the exception of the country market share.
The team was also appointed to the National Team by Michael Kohonen, the co-player of the Seinäjoki Players, who was seen in the English shirt for the first time in the World Cup last December.

Essi Hassu is about to end the beach volley player at least once after the current period.
Beach championships in Finland will be decided at the Kouolela Sports Park.
For three days, the medals will be played both in the adult and in the youth series.
In cooperation with the SM final tournament organised by the Kou Volan World Players and the World of Finland, the top three sets of each will be ranked as the top three sets of each.
The first colour in the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish Beat Volley Summit for several years now.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of the familiar audience.
As far as possible, we'll be able to see this afternoon.
I'm sure there's gonna be a great arena for Pesstadion.
I haven't played much in the adult series in Kouvola, so it's time to play in the finals at home, Hasu atmosphere.
The Kouvola region lit up Hasu's spark of sport and gave good illegitimate entertainment.
There are very good memories of education.
At the age of 9, I started a football in the E-work of Elänen NMKY.
The top mind is too big a toy shirt, the knee-caps on the ankles as well as the high thunders and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the sports club was a community where everyone was in each other's ways.
The single spirit created an environment where there was fun playing.
All of you were working very hard - the teammate's father trained us and our father was with you.
Essi Hasulle beaw volley was already the premix of the selection.
There's been a song played on the beach of our planet since the 1990s.
Action in the field has always been active.
I also went to the juniors' MS tour to think that one day was there.
This dream will come true when Hasu's game at a party together with Anniina Parkkis in the MS finals.
After the Rikak Lopkänen and Taru Lahti, the second-defended two goal of the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still need a S.M.O. for a prize cap, if you're throwing a riddle at me.
The weekly presence of Kouvola in Kouvola may be the last in front of Hasulle's familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for work will be expected.
It's been a long time since the Kiskallio tournament.
Other toes are nailed at least once, Hasu does.

The 90th anniversary of the Los Angeles Central Library is clearly celebrated in a new book.
Koli Koli of Koli bravely became a farmer.
The business of agriculture means risk-taking, sweat and perversion.
The young farmer, Koli Posun, 25, took up the role of the Minister for Agriculture, because he believes in a strong work in rural areas as well.
Koli soon started working with his little brother, Valtteri Kolin, as his homemaker, two months ago.
Your father's father, Koli, will help and instruct the brothers with his own life.
As a landowner, the fact is that you're borrowing and ordering an increase, so you can't get your hands on agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a little boy.
I've always been on the farm, and now I'm done.
If something is to be done, I think it has to be done seriously and properly.
In 46 we started building a driveway, and the bank had not even been concerned about it at first.
However, I myself had the courage to join the project and have been fully involved, Mr. Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had not believed in pure Finnish food production and that everything would still be good.
The aim of Mr. Koli, who is building a truck, is to invest in his even bigger craft.
The work has been successful, since Koli is the top 10 in the Maasure Future magazine in the young food producer competition.
Right now, he's competing for any profit he can make.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
In the first eight months of the month, Bulgaria reports the inflation for the first time.
According to statistical statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for many years (after June 2012) and the first time it rises more than nine years after last year's autumn, when the earth came to 0.2% of the positive inflation.
The CPI's average annual average over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to 12 months (from August to June 2015) was -0.2%.
In July 2016, the price index was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to 2015) has been -0.2% and the annual per cent of GDP in June 2016 was -0.2% in June 2016.
Compared to the previous month, prices of the following categories of consumer products were observed in June 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
The prices fell in terms of wear and footwear (2.2%), furnishings, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following products remained on the same level as in the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, electricity and other fuels, transport and education.
The anime effect of Snapchat is criticised as an Asian caricature.
Snapchat says the anime that inspired this filter, but some observers believe that it is racist.
With Snapchat lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change the reality and play in ways that are approaching absurdity.
You may change the way you look like an anaesthetic, or form or form a character for Roy Lichtenstein.
Lentils are incorruptible, feature-distorting tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfie per day.
All delusions become very common knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have benefited from the criticism of where it has been charged with the use of blackface makeup or bleached beads as a beauty project.
When it provided some of its users this year with a filter that turned their eyes off, wrongly teeth and made cheeks out of it, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
Critics also wondered if these repeated conflicts would respond to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the wind spread widely on Wednesday and the way it was written about, for example, the Verge and Mothleple the day after Snapchat told me that he had lost the filter.
One of the following was the explanation: the lens was intended to be a tribute to anime characters, not to be the Caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
It's a really nice anime comparison.
The American art student Grace Sparani, whose tweets were widely shared, said in his message that the lens was "at least insulting and awkward".
adding: "It is difficult to deny the comparison of the Asian caramel with the filter's performance.
It shows that the filter is not just a "Yellowface", it is a "unfortunately extreme one."
Snapchat is not something that must be avoided by these cultural traps.
In an American culture, it seems that there will be an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, especially from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat's public audience is made up of young people who are more diverse in ethnic background than their responses. This can mean that they are likely to expect even more know-how.
"When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image, which is used by the user, these kinds of things are no longer easily ignored as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in the interview on Thursday.
Zhu, the manager and designer of the media release platform, decided on Thursday to delete his Snapchat account and try to do the same.
In his media article and in his phone interview, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in Snapchat's recruitment methods.
Zhu criticises, for the most part, the leadership of the company, made up of white and men only, and wrote by Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It is clear that in one-sided staff there are no colored people who can make these kinds of decisions, or they are also employed in colour, but their position is not such that they dare to tell their minds honestly and easily," says Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely rejected the argument.
One does not publish the numbers of its staff from the ethnic background, on the basis of its status as private individuals.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to ask about the ethnic background of his staff, but according to his informant, the employee has recently hired a recruitment officer who is intended to enter into a well-managed group of people and promote participation within the company.
In this respect, Zhu says that he likes his Snapchat account closed and adds: "I wonder if they really need more of us to be able to say that this is not OK."
According to the Congress's expert expert, the military official was wrong about Isinen's information.
On Thursday, the Congress’s expert group reviewed the report that the US armed forces, Central Command, amended the intelligence reports so that they would give a more optimistic picture of the war against Isis in a more optimistic way than what the events in the field gave them to understand.
The presidents of the Republican Committee responsible for the inquiry and defence of the House Army Services Committee set up a working group that reports on the "general dissatisfaction" of military intelligence analysts in the interim report.
Central Command, on the other hand, Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States armed forces in Tampa, Florida, responsible for operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Inquiry by the Supreme Directors of Centcom generally gave a more positive picture of the US anti-trafficking activities than the facts in the field, and were certainly more positive than what the other US units in the analysis," reports the press release on the report.
"Centcom's events are unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when they report false analyses to high-level political decision-makers," says President Ken Calvert of the Republic of California.
"The errors in Centcom's lead port reach the highest level of the organization."
A 10-page report on the problems that have occurred between 2014 and 2015 in detail, including the descriptions and analyses of Central Command's activities to train the Iraqis, reports on the activities of the United States.
The report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports made by the Obama Administration have been forged, it gives an overview of the investigations, which suggests that the Centcoms would have pushed them into a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
"In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command's press releases, statements and testimony to the United States were much more positive than what was happening in the report," says the report.
"For example, the Centcom official made a public statement that a great military campaign for the return of the site could take place in April or May 2015."
Mosul, which is the second largest home in Iraq, is still under the control of the Father.
"After months of research, this is very clear," says United States Republican representative Mike Pompeo in his briefing.
"From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest intelligence officers in the United States armed forces, in the United States, were manipulating the intelligence received, without any doubt, in the face of my father."
The Republics established a working group after having learned of the doubts expressed by the analysts that the information on the fathers was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more detailed reports, as the studies will continue to follow.
In addition, the Ministry of Defence's Chief Inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
The members of the constitutive committee responsible for the inquiry of the House on Thursday are drawing their own conclusions, which were at present in agreement with the conclusions of the Republican Bureau.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created too limited a process in which Isis and the Iraqi security forces were evaluated", says Adam B. Schiff, a high-ranking spokesperson for the Committee.
According to Schiffi, this method "switched the publication of the results of the inquiry, "injured the morals of the analyses" and "not enough to take into account the differences in views".
However, according to Schiffi and the Democrats, there was no evidence that the White House would be under pressure from Centcom's analysts to adapt its conclusions to "the objective or the political public".
The news site Daily Beast reported on Tuesday’s survey of the beginnings of the survey.
Last time, the New York Times reported on an investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector, which was initiated following actions brought by Centcom’s investigators.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, informs that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the report as long as the inspector's investigation is in progress.
However, he says: "In many cases, experts disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Defence welcomes a healthy dialogue on these key issues of security."
There are other consequences of the investigation, not only that it is trying to find out if the US-led bombings have been successful in Iraq and Syria (one more point raised by the public defender).
However, the arguments made last year may have doubted the extent to which President Obama can rely on the Central Command and the fact that it gives real evaluation of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticisms of father-to-father intelligence corresponded to differences of opinion over a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hookertös, according to a study conducted by President George W. Bush, in spite of the objections raised by many of the investigators, supported only a small number of troops in Chicago and only took a little time to think about what the 2003 invasion would have resulted.
Hooker also played a key role in the uprising on Isoise's intelligence.
According to the authorities, last year Hooker's work concluded that, despite opposing public statements, the aerial attacks at refineries under Isis had not seriously affected the labor economy because it had built temporary workshops and was able to sell them on a dark market.
The result was not conveyed outside the Central Command, The Times in September.
The commander of Centcom at that time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was critical of last year after many legislators had assessed too positive estimates of the war on the testimony issued to it.
General Austin retired in late August and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as his successor to the Central Command.
The second is the fourth double fight in the mahogany, and it is establishing its position in the middle of an inquiry with the United Kingdom.
With three goals in the win, in the game of goals 6 to 1, the United States made the first two goals for the country team on Thursday, which the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be regarded as a great achievement, but Bam, aged 27, was not sure if he ever made it that way before.
"I have no idea," he says.
"I don't belong to people who need to read about their paintings."
However, he knows that the Americans have won four games in their Olympics and lost a hot game and are sharing in their group at first with the United Kingdom, which continued its winnings on Thursday at the United States chapters 2-0.
The United Kingdom and the United States are playing the opposite game on the last day of the first round.
Each team survived the final outcome, which will determine which of them will be the second and second of the six teams.
The first is a longer-term encounter with the tough Dutch team that won the second picture.
Despite what is going on in every game, the Americans have already raised the odds of their surprising success in this race, four years after it was the last of the 12 teams in the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He went to the team at the age of 16, and he was the youngest national team player of all ages. He became the first to enter his country country at the age of three.
The 2008 Olympics were missed when he did not work on the album.
After this year's 2012 competitions, where no success was seen from the start and his team.
The following year the coach was appointed as an Englishman, Craig Parnham, and then things began to change.
"The change was cultural, mental and physical," says Bam.
"Our work in London was not like it is now.
I have made a complete translation."
On Thursday night, Bam opened the goal during the first half of the ball with a move in close to the ball.
One had come into play without any tournament profits, but it proved to be a surprisingly strong opponent and maintained the 1-0 position until the third period, when Bam acted on the field.
Bam passed along the ball along the left side of the field, twisted to the center, hit the ball in the finish, and thus took the Americans 2-0 to the lead.
Ms. Gonzalez made the third goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The game was the first of the tournament in which the US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to score the goal. In the first three games, the American goal had drowned in each single match.
Briggs is now living his career,
Just like bam.
"Our position is good now," says Parnham, but all right, that's the end of the game.
The Olympic Hull in the middle of a trampoline brings you something like that.
In any event, no matter the timing and time of the finals, it is inevitable that one of the most important events will be held at any time.
Rio de Janeiro events, competitions and struggles will feel like the next intense message all the time and everywhere.
It is as if the Olympic fire itself would be a flaming message cable that moves from a firefighter to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
You can't open a television station, study a newspaper, or try to talk to each other about a conversation in a coffee shop line that you can't possibly hear about Simone Party, Katie Ledeckus or Michael Puses and Chad le Closs.
And then there's a party called Logan Dooley.
The Olympics' next Dooley charm with a good look and might well be the name on everyone's lips, which would be seen and famous for the best viewing and listening time, would be popular with the sponsors and would be present in TV commercials if he were just a bright, gymnastic or even a swordman.
Dooley, 28 from the Great Lake Forest, competes in the Olympics on the trampoline.
The Olympic Games do not equal all competitions.
Farthest from the center, there are some less well-known sports, such as air gun shooting, fire extinguishing, badminton and taekwondo.
We'll always be in the front, and we'll always be in the middle of the championship.
But if I may be allowed to write a simple story about my own special favorite, I would like to pay attention to the secluded charm of trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic since the 2000s, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many of the people I interviewed did not even know it was an Olympic.
The lack of clarity can be a point of view.
Of course, the United States of America has participated in the Olympic trampoline, but the country has never made it to the medals and has never made it to the finals until 2012.
As men in trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russians, and women on the medallion are two Canadians.
The Chinese Dong and the Canadian Rosie MacLennan defend this year the gold medals they won in London.
However, Trampolis has the appeal power of the underdog, partly because of the uncivilized substitution it sounds more appropriate for the circus school than for both subjects.
(In this context, I recognise that I am not an expert, just a normal fan.)
The species have a comical effect, which has been used in the cartoons in endlessly continuum situations, but it also has the same value as in gymnastics and swimming, i.e. in species that are essentially incorporated in trampopolis.
The word trampoline comes from the word el trampolín, which means "punitive platform".
The ambitious champions will jump on a huge trampoline that will push you to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before descending on their feet, jumpers will have to make aberrant movements such as spins, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympics, you are being evaluated on the basis of performance, severity and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete on the title of the trampoline competition, 16 and 16.
The trend for the most common Olympic species is moving forward.
In the pursuit of gold, the mind must go further, faster, faster, higher and higher, sometimes above the goal, sometimes at times around the field.
In addition to a paint or a wall of origin, they also have another objective to pursue in television-based reporting weapons, the true world or the Olympic record.
This determined goal is noble, admirable, even fanatical — and is even able to get the viewer to tears.
This is also what I find exhausting only in the eyes of the poor.
This trampoline offers a stopover.
Trampolis is heading upwards.
The aim is not to move forward.
A gymnastics worker bounces up weightless as an astronaut, falls down and tends to bother back up.
Of course, there is also a competition aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve an intense attack on the target or jumping point, only a dreamy and melting time and strength.
It's just as close as the Olympic Games can get away with it.
Women's games and finals are scheduled for the afternoon and start at 1 p.m. local time and match at the same time.
NBC will send the finals as part of its afternoon message, which will take place either day at 2 p.m. on the 14th day.
The Olympics who bring in a calm and wonderful moment, which may be ignored by a general loonyman.
And if awareness can only be increased by making it possible to look at male athletes and objectify them – as the U.S. Manpowerers in the Wall Street Journal recently suggested – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to notice.
The whole generation protests in Ethiopia, which is a long-standing ally in the United States.
Violent protests in Ethiopia.
Government forces have been violently involved in dissenting demonstrations throughout Ethiopia that require change.
According to witnesses, a number of protesters have been shot to death in conflict with the police.
Is Ethiopia falling apart?
For the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a half of the western Union, the economy of which has once again grown.
In the last month, however, the country has been ravaged by anti-promising demonstrations that are spreading to the widest areas.
Just the last few people rushed to the streets, demanding a thorough change.
According to the civil society organisations, the government was impeccable.
According to the witnesses, the police shot and killed a number of unarmed protesters.
The impressions are expected to be seen in the videos described at the beginning of last year or at the beginning of this year, as to how safety is hitting on young people who are forced to stand still.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for in-depth research.
"The coherence of the country has always been difficult, and further progress has been even more difficult," says Rashid Abdi, the research director of the International Crisis Centre for the Horn of Africa project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second country in Africa to which the Western world has promoted.
The United States and the United States of America and the United States of America strongly support the Ethiopians in their fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, especially in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, receive such assistance from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has gone radically, and there is still a new urban port in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Addis Ababa.
City streets are now peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from a model of democracy. Human rights organisations have constantly reported on the rule of oppression, opposition in the country is very limited and dissenting the dissidents.
Many people have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
The way things can be changing.
"If people are suppressed, and that is all they have to say, it's going to come out," says Seyoum Teshome, a professor at Central Ethiopia.
"All the people are in the mood for their minds.
The whole generation resists."
There are many reasons for failure, every use of the land under the control of the ecclesiastical rule.
After last year's widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies knew each of the opposition's previous places, which will lead them to control the entire Parliament now.
That means that the tensions are increasing at the Eritrean border, where hundreds of dead victims were killed in the battle that took place in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years, more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Revolution or the Ogaden Revolution, may try to use confusion and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the mind of the surface is falling apart right now.
The first is obvious guilt: the smartphone.
Over the past few years, Ethiopians have been able to communicate in the public media when the cheaper mobile phones became public and the internet became more accessible.
Even if the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during the demonstrations, they can, however, access the Internet via the proxy servers that hide their location.
Many Ethiopians said that this was how they called people into demonstrations.
The second is the increase in humanity between the two largest populations of Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amharas, the second reason for this increase in humanity.
Oroms and amhars are not natural allies.
Amharas, mainly from Christendom’s superstitious highlands, have already managed the politics and business of the country and have taken out oromas, most of which are Muslims and live in the Netherlands.
This is also changing.
"Cooperation is deepening and we are coming under the same umbrella," says Oromo Director-General Mulatu Gemechu.
The most important demonstrations are currently in the oromo and amhara regions.
Many Amharas and Oroms are trying to ensure that Ethiopia is ruled unfairly by the tigrel family, which represents only about six percent of the population and, however, manages the world, the press, trade and politics.
The third cause of the restlessness is the death of Meles Zenaq.
Meles was the Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, and he died of an unrestrained illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius who could see behind the corner.
Analysts show that he was particularly skilled at detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and sending out the leaders who were considering the defendants.
"The current government lacks this essential instinct," says Conspirator Abdi.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn entered Meles' boots from the unknown.
Like Meles, who was from the region of Tigre, North Ethiopia, the Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts indicate that he has no trust in security forces managed by the Tigre tribe.
Many people fear this means more bloodshed.
For the first time in Ethiopia, there were similar riots in 2005, when thousands of people protested against the elections, which according to the analysis the government first failed and then stole.
In post-election restlessness, many protesters were killed. True, the deaths were less than in the previous months, and the restlessness ceased relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their far-reaching infrastructure design, such as the new urban city train, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
The intrepid resentment towards the rule of Ethiopia has clearly not been a factor in the strength of it.
And the takeover is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month in Gondar in Amhara, protesters attacked companies owned by tigers, and the anti-tigress talk is on the way to the media.
Analysts indicate that protests put the United States and other Western settlers in trouble.
The United States has moved to Ethiopia as a base for the unmanned, the rest of Somalia to a wide range of aircraft, but the facts have recently come to light.
While we want to support democracy clearly, it also does not want to collapse its commons already in the unstable region.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he's being sarcastic in his claim to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back in the last debate on his campaign, claiming that he was not really being claimed several times this time by President Obama and Hillary Clinton.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican Presidential candidate to send a clear message to the people of his country.
It is also difficult for his supporters, who must try to defend themselves in these harsh moments and explain the comments he does not mean.
Trump made a statement at the meeting on Wednesday night and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he meant by the premise of President and Mr. Hillary Clinton to create Isis.
In the early morning, however, Trump tweeted and said that he had a sarcasm.
Trump took a full look at his speech on the first day of his interviews, when he was serious about his attack on several interviews.
When the radio runner and Conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Truming to smooth up his claim by saying that Obamahan is trying to destroy ISIS, the President of the Republican Republic refused to give up his claim.
The last one of them was when Trump was trying to focus his campaign back on the decline in farm support figures.
Trump and Clinton held an economic policy dialogue in Michigan at this time.
Friday, Trump tried to reintroduce the subject.
He warned me that Clinton's work would raise taxes, and he thought Clinton's speech was annoying.
Trump has defended himself at all times.
At the end of July, he received a great deal of criticism when he asked for the help to hack into Millary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments, saying, "Of course, I was mammoth."
In this way, it will stretch the limits of the political speech and draw its words back as soon as possible.
"I believe that it is his way of conveying certain messages that are counterproductive to his supporter. He sees how the supporters respond to messages, and "to clarify whether or not"," says Communication Officer Ruth Sõrman, who has observed the language of each of the main candidates.
"But I also believe that he understands his reasoning and knows that they are round enough to make sure that they do not get the same."
Instead of texting his opinions to the electoral community, Trump has, in recent days, made himself more and more sensitive when his number of votes of support has continued to fall.
A new opinion poll published on Friday by the NBC, the Wall Street Journal and the Christianist revealed that Trump's support is significantly lower than in Clint in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is very even.
While Trump is usually trying to try to ask for his provocative words, he often blames his critics for correctly interpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
However, after paying ever more attention to their presidential election in the last few months, Trummin's games have put his loyal supporters in a awkward position, where they are obviously in favour of Trummin's comments, no matter how provocative they are.
One of the most important supporters, Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, advocated the presidential election in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I would like to say that he was a well-founded, pompous speech," replied Giuliani, when I asked him if Trump was real about the claim that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Isis.
"It is true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, an organization that Obama called completely wrongly "the lower set of teams", and this is why it happened because he pulled many of them out."
Most of the Republicans representing the mainstream are trying to claim that the Obama regime, where Hillary Clinton was Foreign Minister, allowed Isisin to continue his work when he did not act decisively in the Middle East.
Before one election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media in the knowledge of where he accused them of talking about defamation and about a violent attitude towards you.
He mocked the "qualifying and pathetic" media comments that try to learn about him, but he says he can't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and they just said it would prove better than before that that he would not be a president.
For the sake of a reasonable rent, quit opening a coffee shop in Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a big-ass coffee shop in Williamstán, where the money was only cash and where there was no Wi-Fi, but who offered good coffee for 15 months.
Of course, the workshop had to be priced out of its street spot in Bedford Avenue when the request was made to be unreasonable.
In place of Verb Cafen in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, who has become Soap Cherie, is selling cake-shaped soaps in the form of cakes.
They consider this mid-termisation to be an important factor in avoiding the loss of the cafe.
Artist Molly Crabapple is well aware of: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB won't exist anymore, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed and Verb is now a shopping store."
But even if New York is no longer in any way, it will also create a new one.
Last night, Verb Cafe opened a new coffee shop in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and you can pay with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same and the atmosphere is still inconclusive.
It's still good.
The owner and manager of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old coffee shop.
He started in Verb in 2001 and he was working all the way there.
When one of the customers offered to finance the opening of a new factory, he said he was very busy doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb holds bagels from the same supplier as before and uses the same espresso model.
It also reintroduced the new verbs of modern verb.
Rodriguez says that, however, he also saw something new to see,
add a new one.
Bacon eggs-bread-cheese-sandwives and stuffed with capers and fried onion rings are available.
There are also dark people on the list.
No more beer from the coffee, but instead fresh juices made from fresh ones.
After nine months, Rodriguez says that he has noticed that the old standard agents have started to visit Verb in a steady stream.
"Even many of our old customers were priced out of Williamsburg," he says.
One of them is Rebecca Oliveira, who went to coffee this summer.
Oliveira, 34, formerly lived in Williamsburg and visited verb regularly.
He used to go to Greenpoint, and he used to travel to the verb where he was still stationed in Williamspark.
Verb shut down, he says he's stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I knew I liked verb's tea and culture," he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, even though he's been drinking a chai tea report instead of his two ice coffees, which is also a novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, a long-term client, has been faithfully visiting Verb since 2003.
He used to go to coffee every time he worked and ordered the same thing.
"I took up a coffee every day over seven minutes as a machine, and there they already prepared my butterbage with all the fillings," he says.
Photo: Rodriguez made it possible to try something new and bring something new to his food.
Today, Rosenthal still uses his standard product, but then he becomes a bagel of bacon, eggs and bulk.
Rodriguez says he doesn't have a grudge for the soap shop.
Soap Cherien’s owners even offered to produce special soap for the production of Verb’s own cold-baked coffee.
"We're still going to make an offer," says Rodriguez.
The former Polish people who lived in Green Point have also welcomed the laborshop with joy.
One of the new users turned the menu upside down, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a place for him so that his new friends feel welcome.
The place has brought other benefits.
The local juice shop wants a bottle and a cup of cold-baked tea.
The villa may also expand next to the building.
For many customers, however, it is important that they get their own favorites from the new verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer in Williamsburg, and he says his heart was broken when the coffee bar was closed.
When a new place was opened and I ordered a coffee, it felt like I came home, says Whitt.
"I love the smell of coffee."
The great depression of the great season is a heavy food in the new work: AAA Mean
In March 1933, shortly after his office as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the room for lunch in the middle of the house.
President Roosevelt, who was known as the Culinary, was pleased to feed on the restaurant in Fifth Avenue, such as his hen pasta and Maryland's placekeeper soup.
On that day, his list of meals was more modest: devil's eggs (delified Eggs) in tomato cake, potatoes and dessert from a plum baby.
"It was a demonstration of culinaryism for people who suffer," says Jane Ziegelma.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message for the public about how to eat."
A couple living in New York Heights work for both church historians.
The last book of Coe, called Ch Suey, tells about the Chinese cuisine in America, while the latest book of Ziegelman, called 97 Orchard, tells about the story of the story of the apartment building in the town of Lwer East Siden.
His new joint work is Harper's publishing and Tuesday's release A Square Meat, which describes the history of the American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The couple referred to their own culinary solidarity at a meeting with the editor Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar in the vicinity of the Flatiron Cloud and was opened in the same year as the big stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, potato and mixed anger.
When the editor ordered a bonnet, the couple said it was very appropriate to have a very large epoch for a discussion.
"The tools were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People use the earth's minerals, the livers, and the beans.
They were made of substances that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine eating so much peanuts that they're enough for the whole thing."
Andrew Coe makes a noise.
"It must press in the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great years of depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, worked on the buffet principle, "eat as much as you want".
Women's food for farm workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served with freshly-flavoured pies.
The Americans had sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meat is a flexible way for the public to survive when the abundance was suddenly turned down.
"This was the time when food became a key and troubling topic for the Americans" says Coe and explains why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The annoying new cheap news was: according to Ziegelman, mysterious foods such as worry and battery food became the main food, and the pet food was called "a great way to use the feed stars" because the machines could cover up not so attractive materials with cream powder.
Fresh fruit was replaced with less dried green beans.
The man who had been the third part of the American family in the last few years came to be a wasteful use of luxury.
Crude mixtures, where the most important thing was the completion of calories and food values, and not so much the taste or even even the sound of the pipe.
In carrying out a study for a book, which also includes recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared a pula-time meal of ground-based oven powders.
"It didn't get to be popular at dinner table," says Coe, where.
Ziegelma adds: "It was unlikely.
Landings and ovens do not match at all.
This was a characteristic of many household recipes."
Households, as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Economic Office, in the years 1923-1943, served as the head of the State's household, conducted civil employment practices in an unprecedented and unique way.
They publish papers and articles in newspapers and journals, and try not to be very specific budget holders and respond to the challenge of making delicious dishes of the likes of the kermaspage.
The A Square Meat book is an integral part of historical flavors.
In particular, there are reports of government reactions to its people, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Give me a cake" position.
While he publicly praised the children for their food on an iowal farm, he was, as a million and refined lord, who had become of him.
"He liked a continental pan-European kitchen, like fish and cucumbers" says Coe.
"he should be in the middle of the house, wearing a tuxedo on top of his head.
He was completely welcoming from reality."
Mr Roosevelt could have done the same thing if his wife, Eleanor, had no idea how to look at him.
The book says that when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in the taste, the food in the house was not only the most boring, but also the worst-made food in Washington."
Many of the food from the depression was abandoned as soon as your country returned to its feet.
According to Ziegelman, the survival of tradition still stands at the point of our attention to calories and food and how science is applied to cooking.
The couple, when writing the book, have started to understand better the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother, the fact that she cannot throw away her home.
"he was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away," said Coe.
"People could even beat his food," recalls Ziegelma.
"For example, for the first time, about the smelling. "
When the main food plates were empty at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Zigelma and Coe brought out the pumice food they prepared at home, the one that President Roosevelt had at lunch.
"It's called a plum foam," says Ziegelma and adds that giving a good name to a modest receptacle was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, just plums, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We immersioned in the back of our feet in a thick, brown hole.
Not at all. Not at all.
Coe played twice and twice.
"The German nuts know about this better," Coe says, "of course, sounding like a positive budget holder."
Gilead has the full legal fees for the patented hepatitis C medicine with Merck.
The Court of Justice of the United States of America ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to make a full exception to the legal fees it received from Merck & Co Inc for a legal dispute concerning the patent of the hepatitis C medicinal product with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released for 200 million million of damages committed against two Merck-owned patents in violation of the Gilead Sovaldi and Harvoni-s. The United States judge found that Merck committed crimes involving the commission of a second oath and other unfair practices.
In the action brought on Thursday by the Court of Justice of the United States of America, Beth Labson Freeman says that Gilead was right to object to legal fees which he was entitled to defend the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which manages the market with a new set of anti-hepatitis C drugs that can be treated with over 90% of hepatitis C.
This is the case in 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other's rights and called for the public service right of Sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in Gilead’s medicines.
The United States forces have taken over the city of Manbij from Isis, the city of Manbij.
Some of the supported troops have taken control of Manjib in Manjib, near the border of Latvia, in northern Syria, when the only extremist Isis fighters left, says a team informant.
Syria's democratic forces (SDF) group is now building up to find all the Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A member of the United Nations Council of Manbij, Sharfan Darwish, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages captured by ISIS fighters have been seized.
"We're all in possession of this place now, but we're still doing search operations," said Darwish.
Clintons earned 10,75 million in 2015 and value 34.2 per cent in the general government
In 2015, Democratic President Hillary Clinton published his tax return, which shows that he and his spouse's income at that time amounted to 10.7 million dollars and the actual government tax rates paid by him and his spouse at that time to 34.2.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. First President Bill Clinton was responsible for nearly 5.3 million dollars in speeches, and the Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton, formerly acting as Secretary of State, announced that he earned $3 million from Simon & Schuster, his book, which dealt with his post in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's Deputy Vice-President, President of Virginia Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton announced a 10-year tax return.
The actual federal tax rate paid by that country in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are still looking for economic transparency", says Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier in his communication.
The complete opposite is Donald Trump, who lies behind excuses and withdraws his promises to make his tax information.
It is common for the United States of America to have always published their tax information, even though the law does not require it from them.
Trump, a New Yorker, and his lawyers have appealed to the audit of the financial government to explain why Trump has not published his income data.
"Sirto is yours" texted Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, referring to the democratical tax information.
On Thursday, Trumpi's Vice-President, Michael Cohen, told the CNN that he would not allow Trumpi to disclose his tax information until the checks had been completed.
Most critics, including the 2012 President of the Republican Republic, Mitt Romney and other members of the Republic, have said that his refusal to disclose information questions about Trump's own resources, his grants to the welfare, his business and many other aspects, including relations with him.
Clinton has taken hold of this issue and re-enacted the online video, where he will bring up the present Republicans, who will reinforce Trump's tax information to release his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades and not to make public his tax returns," he said to the Clinton public.
According to the Politico website, Trump did not pay taxes at all or at least twice in the 1990s, and New York Times' business columnist quoted on one occasion a number of co-legislators and auditors that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rates have become the central issue of the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported a rule named by investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that at least one-third of the earners would pay a tax.
Also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week in Omaha, Nebraska, at a Clinton election, Buffett, the head office of the Berkshire Hathaway multi-venture company, challenged the Trump meeting, where they both disclosed their tax information.
Buffet tells us that he is also a member of the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authority, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been taxing until 2007.
Clintons currently resident in Chappaqua, New York, account for 32 per cent of the average value of the second federal tax in 2007-2014 and the actual total tax rate they paid was around 4 per cent.
The Clinton 2015 tax return indicates that, unlike most of the Americans, only 100 of their income was paid.
Their capital investment was a low-cost index investment fund, and Clintons reported the amount of interest and interest income at USD 109 000.

In order to support the protection of elephants by means of a lead powder-filled mobile environment in Tanzania, it is necessary to provide a high level of protection for elephants.
Naturalists in Tanzania have created an unusual way to keep elephants away from human costumes – elephants are being hurled by throwing chili powder at them.
The show has proved effective, and the idea has been invented recently by the Hungarian Foundation, together with the US Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign to teach the village of North Denmark volunteers how residents can protect their homes and grow elephants without harming them.
One second ago, the elephants were sneezing with spears.
Saturday is a world elephant dedicated to the protection of animals.
"We have seen a change of attitude in these areas, for now the villagers can count on their ability to keep the elephants away from their fields without harming them," says Damian Bell, Executive Director of the Homeguide Foundation, in his communication.
At first, an intrusive elephant is disturbed by showing a flashlight and using a horn.
If this doesn't work, let's throw the so-called chilipilvi.
The multi-mixtured chili powder is put into a condom with a wire, followed by the end of the condom to be fixed so that only the ignition thread is excluded.
When the ignition device is lit, the condom explodes the paper and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the atmosphere.
Only one spiced cloud could be used to drive an elephant away.
The last way is by shooting a Roman candle-known fireworks into the air and creating an explosive and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticised the beblin hotel for removing the economical number of the Arabs from the "hot" – RT News.
A French film director, who was quite a Jewish film director, gave birth to the media track when he discovered that the Kimpinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not mention the heading in its country index.
Claude Lanzarote, author of the Shoah document on Holocaust, was able to express his frustration at the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) newspaper.
At its recent visit, Lanzm found Israel's guide list for the hotel.
On the other hand, it is not one of the countries in which the room can be spoken straight.
"How is it possible that in September 2016, in the New German capital, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist at all?"
Lanzmann is writing.
On the other hand, both Bristol and Bristol will allow us to consult each other through a separate exchange of views.
The film director asked for an explanation of the hotel reception.
Mr. Lanzmann wrote that the response of the reception officer was directed by him.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the proposal was "the decision taken by both sides".
The reason behind this was the film director again.
According to Lanzman, the official said: "The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they call for the removal of the heading of the country."
In an interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German Ambassador to Israel, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said "of course."
"The kill stuns us all and upsets us all.
It's a big one.
And the more upset it is, given that we are in Germany, and this is the only hotel that we are talking about.
There is no need for any further explanation.
We expect the right conclusions from the hotel," says the Ambassador.
The incident caused quite a reaction in one where it was called a scandal.
You took part in the prosecution of once-in-a-life claims made by the once-in-a-kind customers of the Kinkinski Hotel.
"Get away" was said in a publication that revealed the location of the hotel near the synagogue in Kurfurstendamm.
Der Spiegel is the hotel's controversial accusations quickly, called it a mistake and asked for forgiveness from Lanzarote.
"Indirectly forced to leave Israel out of the heading list was never made," writes Suddeutsche Zeitung, representative of the Kumpinski Hotel, Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the number has been added to the list at a later date.
He was looking for cynical gas and rubber bullets in a demonstration by Brazilian students.
The students got together with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they joined together in a protest against public reforms in the public education system.
Use protestors against tear gas and rubber bullets.
When law enforcement tried to reintegrate a group of students, the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
There were hundreds of students who wanted to show their discontent with government plans.
Governor of the Land of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, has proposed a conservation measure in which almost 100 schools are established and 300 000 students are placed in new schools.
Participants made graffiti for walls where the Presidential Office was also opposed to the Michel Temer.
The workers' demonstration took place just a few days after the streets were separated from President Dilma Roussef from the provocative protestors in the country in the vote on this issue.
Trade between the two countries has increased by 71% - UM
Since the departure of the packages, annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 7.9%, says Foreign Ambassador Levan Dzhagarya.
According to him, business interest in business in Iran has increased since the international sanctions against Iran were imposed.
"Possible companies maintain existing relations with Iran, while companies are best placed to enter the market.
Trade imports are still one of the primary objectives of cooperation between countries," says Dzhagaryyan.
He concluded that during the first five months of 2016, turnover between turnover and Iran increased by 70.9 in the same period in 2015 and rose to USD 856 million.
"In particular, Russian exports went up fast to 91.5%, to 6 million dollars.
Imports from Iran from the country increased by 16 to $1 million in 16 years.
The sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons was boosted," says Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also looks forward to record the number of governors travelling to Russia this year.
"For the last year, the Russian Foreign Mission in Iran gave Iran about 35,000 visas, the majority of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was the first country in the 20th country to which the citizens visited in Russia.
It is not too dangerous to say that the record number of tourists travelling to Russia will change this year," he says.
On the other hand, the number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the Ambassador wishes to change.
"I can personally recommend that you stay in the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which have left the monuments of Persian civilization in good condition," he says.
Scot Callum Skinner scored the goal of winning the bikes.
The Scottish Callum Skinner appealed to the reputation of the players in the team's print on the Rio's Velodrom last night, when the British Trio defended the title earned in London in 2012.
Glasgow's 23-year-old Skinner was in the position of the anchor he played by his country's Scottish Sir Chris Hoy. The young man made an effort to thank him for his goal and for his victory as a pre-emptive team in New Zealand.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago, when Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after only the sixth of March in the March London Cycling World Championships, despite Hoy leaving his competition for the last time.
The problem between Beijing and London was the first role played by the driver in replacing Jamie Staff.
Leis came up just at the right time.
Hoy's decision to decide on the race was also left behind the gap between Kian Motherd and Matt Crampton.
The Scottish Skinner was the man to whom the British coach believed and where they saw the locust, which he has now redeemed.
Hines, Hoy and I won the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner won the last Olympic record in time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the three of Great Britain won in a duel.
Although he was shy after his game, Kenny made a effort to lead the team, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was made in such a way that, in time to slow down speed at the highest speeds, Kenny and especially Skinner were able to speed up.
Hoy observed BBC as a commentary and reached Skinner, Kenny and Hindes while he was standing on the prizes.
Glasgow, 23-year-old Skinner, says: "I'm flattered for comparison.
I was just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made an Olympic record in the finals and won the world's worlds.
It was incredible.
There's no better way."
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes together with Kenny and Hoy, having accidentally landed on the track because of a bad departure.
Later, he withdrew his word, and the UK's competitors had no choice.
There were no problems of this kind with winning the sovereign.
He says: "The feeling was like in London, all the British flags were flying around.
Our team was formed together in the last three months.
We have lost so many worlds that victory in the Olympics seems to be a miracle."
In other words, one truth, one greatest goal for a country that won seven out of the seven six ratans in both Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of the progress made over the last six months, the last five days will be on the debt account.
As Kenny has shown, it is not impossible to imagine that she will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympics in all the Olympic Games.
This means drawing up an account on six divine medals and one silver medal for Kenny, which is about 12 years larger than Hoy and was also born on 23 March (the magical date of British sports, which is also the anniversary of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
The medal grants would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny's next in business, who's going to talk today and solve in three days' time.
A Bolton 28-year-old Kenny says, "At the moment, all I can do is enjoy this.
The game race is always the best.
Have fun with each other.
It's like being lonely."
He says, "If he still wins two grand medals, he must have the knight's value."
This was the only match of the day, but the United Kingdom received more news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four men on the team run.
The time was 3:1.
The world that was created in London in 2012 and that won the gold is 3:51.699.
The first round and final (section 22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition, and the focus will certainly be on Wiggins.
He and his competitors had a last-minute dispute with each other about the time he was called to the same length by the contractors.
In the same competition that will take place and tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Mingavi reached World record time 4:13.260.
The British team can now count on its powerful team of bikers to withstand the middle of the Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
The expectations before Rio have been assessed in the wake of the truly exceptional evidence of Beijing and London.
There have been dramas on the back, the least of which have not been the intimidation of Director Shane Sutton in the middle of the arguments about sexism and bullying, and the end of major athletes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
First of all, however, the competitions on the velochrome indicate that the real reputation of the United Kingdom's rise to the top at the present time is once again being realized.
The future of the Portland melting plant is at risk for the end of the electricity agreement.
The future of the outskirts in Victoria, Portland, and therefore the jobs of workers are at risk when the power plant operator told that one of the factory owners was about to terminate the contract and that all production contracts would be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken by the Victorian Government last year not to interfere with the aid that the plant is in operation.
42, 20 years of aid for the period of absence of aid.
There is a danger of losing up to 2,000 jobs at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Even 2,000 jobs, direct or indirect, may be put at risk by the suspension.
The impact on the environment can continue to exist, as the melting plant consumes about 10 % of the total electricity output in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa shut down Point Henry's melting plant, which resulted in the introduction of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland melting plant loses money and is in danger of being forced to find its door.
The results correspond to the fact that the future has already been subject to a number of speculations, which were first produced by the Australian Republic and published at the price of its production.
AGL, which supplies power to a large fire-extinguishing plant at its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it expects the agreement to be terminated by the ten other refiners, too.
The factory's majority owner is Alcoa and Alumina joint venture. Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp owns minority shares of the factory.
AGL says that it expects Portland's production plant to be in operation, which means that the physical electricity demand is about the melting plant.
AGL states that the so-called protection agreements which were to enter into force in January 2016.
The period of termination of the transactions is 12 months, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects agreements to produce revenue in the financial year 2017," says the power plant.
Any impact on AGL from the financial year 2018 will be further developed by the current market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says that it has already lowered the value of its contracts in its book book of 1,8 million dollars "for the conclusion of contracts".
According to Alcoa, decisions on the re-establishment "are not affected by Alcoa ...'s capacity to keep the melting plant in operation or to secure the supply of electricity to the fuse".
The public undertaking announced that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force since this year, although it still needs to find out why it has now expired.
Due to the low economic situation, analysts have been realistic in the assessment of both the refinery in the Land of London and the factory in Tomago, near New Zealand.
In his speech to the analysts last week, the operational director of AGL told us that Portland spends about 600 megawatts of electricity and Tomago about 900 megawatts on the annual level.
"If these plants enter the market, this means a significant drop in demand (market) on the market.
For us as a producer, it would not be good news," says Mikkelsen.
The Kardashianit project as a cover image of Kendall September's Vogue.
The model of the Kardashian-Jenner code, and the fourth name of his mother and his manager, Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous number of the Ogue of the United States.
Kendall, who is the protagonist of Estee Lider and has appeared with Milan, Paris and New York fashion shows, will be announced on their Instagram account on Thursday.
"Looking at a room full of my most loved ones got me to tears," Kendall wrote.
The publication of the film was followed by an odd video (or perhaps only by the Kardashiant series?), a scripted video showing all members of the Cardashian-Jenner family (Bar Harms Rob and Catlyn and all favorite uncles, Cardashiant program producer Ryan Seacrest) who wrote a second picture of their two positions. Video in the article: they were all in the second surprise lecture for their older brother.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost all the dates of the programmes (Seacrest says words: "Did you think that we'd forgotten you?" as sincerely as the character of the children's ten-TV), but Kris had to make it any other way in this public?
The presence in the Vogue's 19th issue will undoubtedly mean a new era of the Cardassians.
Kendall's big sister Kim was able to reach the Vogue action before (there was a Vogue deck with her husband, Kanye West, in April 2014), but the September issue is just a matter of its own.
The September issue is Vogue's publication each year.
A large number of advertisers are attracted to a large number of images of more than a fashionable magazine (the fashion site Fashion calculated that the last year’s 832 page had 615 pages of advertisements).
The cover of the September issue is so intense that the images in the previous two years have leaked out to the public even before they were officially announced.
Previously, last year's scenes have been like Naomi Campbell, Linda Evans and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more famous works than models that are famous than models.
The winner and the Dior-promosulto Jennifer Lawrence was ranked in 2013 and received Lady Gaga for a year.
The magazine describes Jenner as a success model in its nation, and even if he is among the first to be among the best-working celebrities, he's still quite well with us.
These celebrities are not relatives of people we know, true TV stars or children of the modern age, who know how to do a good Snapchat video (although Jenner of all of them).
They can rightly be described as talented semi-subsistences that exist in entertainment other than entertainment.
Last year's Beyonce in the cover photo has one of the strongest years of his career when he saw his Lemonade album.
Not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Because of its true background, Jener's role in the fashion world will always be a pain in the ass.
In June, the original model of Victoria's Secret, Utie Seymour, criticised Jenner and his fellow Gigi Hadid by calling them "shit".
These things have gone back to the surface when the news of Jenner's presence on Vogue's deck became apparent.
However, the continued act of satisfaction is unlikely to exist.
Kendall Jenner is the film model for the Vaguan September issue.
He's a supermodel, word in the best sense.
Walks through the style box of the Basic Jacobs.
He is the focus of the Estee Lider objectives.
She and all her sisters were making pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He's making pictures of Cindy Crawji's murder, which he pictured for the Love magazine.
And in his spare time, he's on real-time TV, maybe just a way to meet his sister and this child.
Justice units leave 160,000 people
Every year, the most vulnerable people in over 160,000 countries are turned away from the centres of justice, and the sector is preparing for the effects that additional cuts in appropriations will already have on the centres operating at an extreme level.
In the state of Queensland, legal aid and legal services are already being turned away from five people - the majority of them are old people, people, people who are in need, people who are victims of violence and justifications, and people who are not fighting.
Public legal assistance, which is already overburdened, is preparing for further surgery.
As of next month, legal aid centres will be at risk for an additional 30% of the state finances.
James Farrell, Head of the Court of Justice of Queensland, says that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Agency for Legal Affairs, the Centres are already being turned away from the Centres on a yearly basis.
If the board of directors does not spin its decision, Farrell says that the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public legal aid centres are constantly underfunded, which means that some people are being turned away in their search for essential services," says Farrell.
"The people who come out of a violent relationship, the people who are under an uncontrollable and crippling burden of debt, the families they exist, the workers who are unsubstantiated – all of them have problems with the facts, and this report shows that they are unable to provide the help they need.
From 30 June 2017, the federal government intends to cut funding, which means that thousands of the most vulnerable in Queensland will have to cope with complex problems of air support.
We appeal to the Chancellor of Justice and the Queensland Revolutionary George Brandi, so that the financial cuts are stopped immediately, so that we can get the legal aid we need.
Last year, the Federal Government fulfilled the right to import legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to take account of the needs of legal aid centres and their customers, and the Government of Laszczuz must undertake this important work."
Donald Trump’s campaign against the threat of threats to the employee was brought against the opposition.
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was brought to justice when no action was expected to be taken after it had been told that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had been armed while they were driving in Jeep in February.
The event will be described in an action brought by Vincent Bordin, a former U.S. citizen of the U.S.A. campaign, at the U.S. Court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini says he waited months for the situation to be discussed within the campaign before, according to his own words, he understood that this would not happen.
Bordini says in his application that Earl Phillip, the CEO, "produced a pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger and pressed the pipe into Vincent's kneecap".
According to a complaint to the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini found that almost four others had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the guns are not fired, it will cause damage," says Bordin in his action.
The action will only take two days after the President of the Republic has elected to protest in his speech to the public in North Carolina that "the supporters of the second additional clause" – which is considered to be gunowners and arms fighters – may take measures if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, is elected and elected to the judges.
According to Trump's staff, the media took away his words and Trump did not speak out of violence.
Bordini claims that the campaign should be compensated for the carelessness of the campaign and for the intimidation, assault and mental suffering caused by Phillip.
Trumpic informant Hope Hicks will not be asked to post a comment.
Phil was not targeted despite attempts to do so.
The local news agency in Charlotte, WCCB, reported that Phillip had left the campaign.

Britain must use the Olympic mind to expand Heathrow.
Heathrow also stimulates the economy and creates well-being, not only in the local community and in London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the thing that was most interested in Heathrow. Like in the Olympics of London in 2012, we were tremendously concerned that our entire nation and all our regions would benefit from them.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to Stratt and East End.
We will do this again by creating an open door for local people and for people close to Goodthrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new workshops and 40 000 new jobs, which will help to prevent unemployment in the neighbouring regions.
At the London Olympics in 2012, there are always people who believe that Heathrow's interpretation is too much of a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will be tempted in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be true of Heathrow.
The obstacles that exist will always be met, but Heathrow will answer any question that has been asked.
The Olympics, including Heathrow, are an infrastructure project that helps many instead of many.
The expansion will create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing skills and employment both to the home environment and to the United Kingdom as a whole.
At Heathrow, we have a great task that has been carried out on time and in a budget of £11 billion in infrastructure investment, which included the T5 terminal – voted for the best airport terminal of the year in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal that was built into two of the world's most crowded runways.
They are now the first to be able to reach the first runway, supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be an extension of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic idea for the extension of Heathrow, so that we can guarantee the world and the knowledge and employment that the United Kingdom can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and the former Trade Secretary of the Treasury.
Camblock Plus and Facebook advertising on cat-mouse games.
The efforts of businesses making money from online advertising to mislead advertising prevention software have become a cat-mouse game, says one company producing prevention programmes.
On Thursday, only two days after the Internet has announced on its own page that it will be able to access the adsteste, Adblock Plus Write a blog, where it was said that users could update their blocking software filters and thus again prevent social media advertisements.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would change the advertising codes for its over-the-board website, so that advertising promotional programmes would be more difficult to identify which parts of the page are advertised.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he's been working on the code.
Adblock informant Ben Williams wrote in his blog that "this kind of spin between the open-source advertising community and misleading people has been going on ever since advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will again make its own changes again.
The fact that the world's largest public media effort has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of the fact that the advertisers have formed themselves in the sector.
Around 200 million people worldwide use advertising prevention programmes, reports Pagefair and last year's work.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile devices on a daily basis, and mobile advertising already accounts for about 1 % of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the Commission intends to make an effort to mislead advertising prevention programmes in its desktop application, as according to the informant, mobile prevention programmes do not work on Facebook's mobile applications and software.
The revenue from the dek advertisements is still very high, which is why Danny considered the investment to be worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us that it is up-to-date for users to update their advertising tool so that users can better check how advertising is targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises the Adblock's new filters, which means that they will also prevent some of the common Facebook writings from being displayed.
"This is not a good time for users, and we are going to solve the problem," said the Facebook informant in his e-mail.
"Advertising programmes are clumsy and ineffective, and we have instead contributed to the development of user settings such as advertising tools, so that people can control the focus of advertising themselves."
She committed suicide by abandoning a car under a Swiss engine.
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
ask for the help of the witnesses to drive on Thursday at the first hour of the visit, where he deliberately left behind.
The accident occurred on the A1-engineway on the port of Vadi near Morges shortly after midnight.
The woman did what she did wrong by lying on the dark road, and she hit one car, she says in the information.
The victim was a 49-year-old woman in Switzerland, and her intention was obviously to commit suicide. Among the overrun cars was a truck.
The woman died at the scene of the accident.
Many drivers who were involved in the accident have already been called, but some are still unidentified. Ask for help or other accidents to report to witnesses.
In the Le Tribune de Geneve, Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter reports that an investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges against drivers involved in the accident are being brought against them.
"Is there a chance to avoid a collision?
It's for the D.A.'s sake," says Hofstetter.
In the last six years, there have been two similar cases of non-responsibility for drivers.
According to the newspaper, in either case, the person walked on a dark engine and the right to decide that motorists cannot wait to meet a pedestrian on a motorcycle.
Last year, the police officer was released for charges against him who had been prosecuted after he had fallen on the A1-engine near Paynne one night in midsummer.
The court heard that a 22-year-old had committed an intoxication and passed out on the road.
It was noted that the way in which the police, who was responding to the emergency, was driving was a reasonable and on the way was "a complete and unpredictable man".
Any accident that occurred in Morges on Thursday close to us, we'll be asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
The modern climate model: Venus has been viable.
According to the assessment of this new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model, which helps you to examine the history of Venus with the same tools and algorithms that are used by climate researchers.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions in Venus could have been the same as the one on the planet, even though Venus is hot and waterless and its medium consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide.
According to previous submissions by the investigators, Venus's slow pacer appears to be on the opposite wheel.
However, on the basis of the most recent simulation, it can be assumed that Veus has been a thin, circular atmosphere, and it has nevertheless gone wrong.
The model was also used to determine early Venus’s surface formation.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been plenty of water and geographical changes in life support and rapid evaporatory.
The ancient Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% flat.
"In the GISS model, Venus spins in the long run and the second half is almost two months long," says GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in his press release.
This is a surface and a rain that creates a large cloud layer. The cloud layer works in umbrella conditions and protects the surface in a large part of the sun.
As a result, the average climate temperature is up to a few degrees lower than the current Earth temperature.
The model created the Venus story, which corresponds to the previous assumptions of planetary scientists about its development.
Venus may have been viable, but for many years it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light.
The oceans disappeared, and the UV light burned steamed water.
In the runaway of water, only the carbon dioxide atmosphere and the deadly greenhouse effect remain — that is, Venus, as it is today.
Researchers reported on the development of a new Venus air-conditioning model in the Metaphysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy, on the other hand, gives up as a coach at Avalanchen.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned as a coach for the Colorado Avalance team and vice-president of the club’s hockey activities, calling for a lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
The Vice-President/Director-General of Colorado, Joe Sakic, confirmed the news and announced that the next meeting would start to apply for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have performed my duties as head coach of the Colorado Avalance team and as vice-president of the hockey team," says Roy in his 50-year-old report.
"I have worked best and hard to understand how I would be able to understand the team, give it the insight it needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the vice-president of the club’s hockey activities must be fully in line with the same objectives.
He must also have a say in the decision affecting the team's performance.
These are not at the moment fulfilled."
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about my decision today," says Sakic.
"We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we hope for all the good for the future."
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach in the league this year for his first season as Head of the National Assembly in 2014–2014.
Following him, the club reached 112 points and won the middle division, but Colorado lost to Minsk in the playoffs and has not been for another two years.
The Avalanche scored 39-39-4 points for the period 2015-2016 and remained five points away from Minnesota Wild in the second Western Conference of the Wild Card.
Hall of Fame Mayor Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the ranks of the ← Canadiens and two in the ranks of the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers start negotiations and stop the strike.
Director-General reports that the wages and salaries of workers in the North Sea will be interrupted when all parties to the dispute participate in the new negotiations.
The Wood Group, which offers oilfield services, has to be charged with drilling trucks under the control of the Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
According to the Common Position of the Parties, "Wood Group and the Trade Unions Unit and RMT confirm that they have agreed to renegotiate the negotiations in order to resolve the dispute".
Next week, from the beginning of the week, we will be attending several full-day meetings for the next few weeks to discuss fresh issues.
Trade unions argued that their recent activity, which, according to them, was the first in over 25 years, was a protest of up to 30% wage cuts for any of them.
Due to national market pressures, Wood Company is cutting its contractors in the North Sea by around 9% this year.
The reduction in the tariffs of the companies concerned was the calculation of the prices of contractors working in the country in 20114 by the 10th of 2011.
According to each of these, the additional elements will give it the space of discretion it needs to explain the decline in the market.
On the other hand, he has lost thousands of employees on his payroll and announced his plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, thus making it more efficient to work with the UK Energy Agency BG.
Lower oil prices and conditions resulting from the decision taken by the United Kingdom in June to leave the European Union create pressure for energy companies.
Mr. Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member, met with the Labour Directors earlier this year to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts experienced in the North Sea for the whole of the whole population.
The North Sea is vital to the rural economy.
"In the North Sea and all over the world, we need a economy that benefits many and not only few," says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be used in 2016 at less than 1.4, while in the last six years there are around 7 billion in them.
Kepler determines the star's speed at which to play in the population of Plejats.
The most recent task of the Kepler Scop is to warm up the orbit of the stars, which has helped to gather the astronomers so far the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of the stars of the Plejats.
On the basis of the new information, the stars of the same population are able to determine why the stars of the same population are spinning in varying order and how the revolutions are related to the planetary formation.
"We hope to learn more from the relationship between weight and age, and even from the history of its realm," says Researcher Luisa Rebull of the Calwork University of Pasadena, in the press, who is working in Pasadena.
The audience of Plejads is located 445 next year from the earth.
About 12 million years ago, many of the stars are about to come, which means that they are just about to reach their adult age.
They are currently living as ever.
With the speed of rotation at the top of the rising stars, the great numbers of stars are pouring out from the star.
These things have a star-braining effect as they progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As it grows older, its speed starts to slow down.
Kepler will determine the speed of each hour by observing the time between the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of the time of
The latest recorded speed data suggests that the larger stars are running slower than the smaller ones.
Rebull matches the stars to the screams — more flashes at a slower rate than the smaller ones.
"We see the Plejads in the "tance" that the real worlds are essentially larger, whereas the most common worlds are generally very soft," says Rebull.
Since the stardom of the Plejas is so close, it acts as an ideal space laboratory that compares the star properties with the speed of rotation.
"The Assembly of Plejas provides a support pillar for theoretical models dealing with both the younger and the film-spinning processes," says Rebull.
We can still get a lot more information on how, when and why the stars will turn around and stop "it".
Rebull and its colleagues will present their latest analysis of the spin rates of Plejats in their three new articles, which will be published shortly in the Astronomical Journal.
