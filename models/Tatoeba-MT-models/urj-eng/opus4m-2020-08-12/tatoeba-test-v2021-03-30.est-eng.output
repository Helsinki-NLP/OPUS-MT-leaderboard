Have a good one.
I don't have any hobbies, except for jayaking.
I just finished the rest of the night.
I'm here.
We all want to go with you.
Clear and clear.
Me, too.
I won't tell you what if you don't.
More generally, please.
Where is it deep?
I'm sorry, Tom.
The guy won the match, standing on four to two.
There's two.
He's atheist.
You know who Tom is, don't you?
I fell on the exam, because I didn't.
The two of you are laughing.
Wait a minute.
Tom never wants Mary.
I need to make some changes.
I didn't want my mother to know about this.
Wouldn't have done it, he did.
That's it.
I'm gonna go in there with a gun.
She waited for my answer.
So, so, what do we got here?
This long-haired young man is rude.
No, no, no, no.
I don't know if he was a kid.
I have to go home and get some sleep.
I hate a man.
I'm a volunteer.
Give me that.
I gave Mary a blue folder.
I'm sorry...
Where is Cornwall?
The player made a big mistake.
I wasn't very busy anyway.

Who am I supposed to be here?
I told my dog to run free.
Maria is a library.
We went on and on.
Where's the vanguard?
Tom loves John, then Tom loves John?
I'm not trying to destroy anything.
We believe it is time to smile more often.
I trust what Tom said.
I'm kissing.
Where's my cinnamon hat?
He stood at the end of the road.
Nothing.
Tom sleeping on the top of the net.
I'm in the middle of something right now.
New York is a huge city.
It's the least of what I've ever been.
Maria is in a piano class once a week.
Are you calling?
I didn't charge you for that.
The handwriting is unreadable.
Good-bye.
Hi, I'm Tomoca Sato from Japan.
Let's see what we can do.
He's his father.
We're late.
How many cars?
The floor of the floor is in its chambers.
I'll have my dinner.
Before this stop, it was never a restaurant.
Hard to resist the urge to turn Tom's neck twice.
I'm gonna get a half-hour's work done.
I'm having a drink.
Are you?
Take this medicine in order.
That was an article.
We'll change the future.
Earthquakes are Japanese customs.
What are the mesiologists investigating?

He's got a basket of strawberries.
It's a game.
I'm going to your house.
Give me a hug.
I didn't know Tomil was a sister.
Walk slowly.
Tom thinks he shot Mary for self-defense.
I agree.
I was looking for the right words.
Let me see.
He doesn't know his strength.
is liquid.
This isn't about life.
You mean?
He wants to become a singer.
Whatever.
We think there's more to smiling.
I'm sure it's quite clear.
Tom is dangerous, isn't he?
I'll take care of it.
Let's start again, let's finish this.
They're mine.
Looks like Tom's sleepy.
You're not going up high.
Otherwise, you should find out how she feels and, uh,
I'll do it.
Why didn't you eat your chocolate?
The doctor used X-rays to examine my stomach.
It's the truth that sitting in a weather like this is the truth.
Mary's running.
I don't know anything about the girl.
- No, it's not.
We'll import coffee.
What is your marriage?
Let me taste it.
Is it a part of the game?
I don't have any other hobbies after jaywalking.
Put your back on, the night air's fine.
I don't sing.
He's all he's ever been.
Sus has a look on his face.
Here we go.
You ate out?
I'm a result.
I want to become a language scientist.
You're on the wrong floor.
- Yeah.
Did you see that?
All beings are freely and equally free of their own dignity and right. They have been given a sense and a conscience and their connection to one another must be carried by the spirit of the brotherhood.
All of them will be you.
You can relax and count on me.
The walrus under that tree is mine.
She'll be a good husband.
Back up.
I want Tom's voice.
I don't want to talk, you broke my heart.
Here.
The literature is the future of the people.
For last night.
Do you speak Turkish?
It's not here.
There's a house.
We're going to play a game in the Italians.
I have five cats.
The powder is water-soluble.
Debbie, is your school near here?
It was two hours ago.
To begin with, we suggest you go to your own profile and show which languages you speak or which languages you are interested in.
We'll work this out.
That's it.
You didn't have to have to.
Huh?
A cat reads a book.
It's very tasty.
What's the weirdest thing you've ever eaten?
What are you doing now?
What is it?
It's...
The bus drove along a long and ridge road.
I used to do that.
Did I miss it?
I'll give it to you.
Are you ready?
I have two conditions.
Hey, you ready?
I need your help.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
The rooms of the room are covered with curtains.
You're coming.
The brush is used to dry the cloth.
I like people like me. I like people.
I'm going to kick my ass.
Come on, let's go.
Tim is a social worker.
No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah.
My dad was walking every night.
I'm in the game.
I'm not bad.
The part where I was out of school, and I was out of school.
Tom needs a change to change.
You blocked me on the Facebook, and now you're going to die.
It wasn't a good idea.
Did Tom get the briefcase?
The picture is in this book.
Take this.
He's a family black sheep.
I'll never tell you about it.
The Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican without adjudgment.
- I'm sorry.
Does Tom believe?
Is the air or the right hand of the Tom?
Although it was raining, I went out.
- He's trying.
Come on!
I didn't mean to go to the family.
Ovens eat both seeds and nuts, as well as insects and mushrooms.
I'd like to get some more sleep.
I don't.
We'll stay here for a while.
There's a lot.
You have to follow.
if you want me to leave you alone.
I don't remember seeing Tom so alone.
Can I see your old books?
If it's the oldest person, you know?
Emila is my best friend.
The nurse is sick.
I'm tired of Paris, but I'm sick of Brussels.
We can see a beautiful sea view.
I think I have a theory about that.
Keep out of the reach and sight of children.
I'm not sick.
No longer trust Tom.
You don't want to go with this jacket.
Mary.
Boys are weird for a while.
All animals, but not all animals.
He's too drunk.
What can we do for you?
No, I'm not.
You can look for words and find translations, but it's not exactly a dictionary.
I've got a cat at home. I've got a cat at home.
There's one.
He worked all night to get ready in time.
Tom didn't want any of his friends to know he was a drug dealer.
Your apology is accepted.
I have a 64-bit processor.
The platform was silent.
It's just a rumor.
Mari shares flowers.
There's something, right?
I can't decide if I'm sad or sad.
I've had enough of him to say.
I have to go now.
I don't.
That's the question.
Let's go for a ride.
I can handle this.
I'll give you a book.
The urge tried to help the social problems.
This adds a new dimension to our problem.
Do you like country stuff?
Reserves don't cost a living.
I have two cameras.
Excuse me, but do you know what time it is?
I owe you a debt.
Horses are animals.
Come on!
It's on the table.
Bill often goes to the park.
I had a glass of wine.
- Is it?
Some people think that the president spends too much time traveling.
Let's go, let's go.
We're trying to get Tom into trouble.
Check that the border window is closed.
I didn't know you were lying.
Tom and Mar are going to leave.
Talk about it.
Will you give it to me?
It wasn't raining for a long time, so they had to dig a well.
You're gonna love it.
You're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're acting like you're not.
Did you go?
It's not that anymore.
I'm afraid of earthquakes.
It's been a while.
I don't need your forgiveness.
I'm sorry about what I'm doing.
What's that?
Are you here tonight?
Absolutely.
That's it, what's it?
That's it, Tom.
We moved to a new project.
It's okay.
Tom told Mary that she would be wise.
He teaches English.
Tom's on his way.
Am I?
He told me everything he had.
The münt is fiery.
The bus leaves every fifteen minutes.
Tom is smart, isn't he?
Listen carefully.
I've got it.
Let's go.
I went to London.
Do you have bread?
It's raining.
I don't want to work under these circumstances.
I've lost my mind.
Did you look at yesterday's flash?
How did that happen?
The lunar cycle is six months long.
I can't get involved in this.
My girlfriend is very good.
Are you coming?
You, who am I?
I'd like to be there for you.
Are you?
You can take it with you.
Wait a minute.
Tom in his bed.
I want a drink.
Is that even possible?
You're using this?
I didn't notice.
I'll wait.
Do you believe that?
I'm sure it's Tom.
How are you doing?
We can do this later.
It seems that no one was paying attention to what he said.
He wrote a letter.
I'll be when I am.
Come on.
I drank milk.
Why are you drinking?
Today is a good time.
The Germans won't help.
What more do you want?
Do you have an ant?
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
- I don't mean that.
I live in Katas.
I didn't think you'd show up.
Tom tells me Mary's on a diet.
What's the newspaper?
Don't you?
They sound so much like it's hard to distinguish between them.
Tom had expected something quite different.
I knew her right away.
Can I talk to you?
It's never easy.
You are a hale.
I'm speaking Chinese, but I can't read it.
Is there something I should do?
Language is officially prohibited here.
Stay calm.
How's your leg?
Mary can use it.
Yesterday my uncle bought some food.
What's the use of talking?
This is my table.
When we started, we were.
He's in the church.
I know how you work.
Anybody want to eat?
I'm not a good person.
I know you were born in Boston.
No, it's not.
I'm going to go see my boyfriend in Germany.
Toms is all yours.
He's older than me.
I wish you were wrong.
I'm from the country.
Happy day.
She's my sister.
Your part is twelve dollars.
Am I?
Tom.
Are you trying to help me?
Come on.
The machine.
I don't have to go - I'm going.
The account is closed.
Tom is three-three.
They have no chance at all.
Mom's pissed.
I like astronomy.
By the way, did you take the umbrella you said you were?
That's the other thing.
The pelicans have big beaks.
Did Tom really?
It's nice in bed.
He's not likely to be heard.
You kept giggling.
I'll eat.
The flower is a red color.
He would have almost drowned in the coup.
Deadly certain.
Tom is not a very good driver.
It would be better if you hadn't come today.
It's not really important.
Check, please.
No, you can't.
He was wrong to think he came to see him.
My wife is a woman.
I will write a letter in English.
Come on.
Hold on.
I'm going to stay with him.
Tom was obviously disappointed.
I'll eat this shirt.
Am I not?
You're on the list.
He's got his afternoon.
Tom came in a bit longer.
I had potatoes peeled in my fingers.
I'm not here for you.
I'm very unhappy right now.
I'm sorry.
Tomb.
Is there a bookstore?
The trap tried to cope with social problems.
Over here!
It's very clever.
I think we should get back to work.
Come on.
Did you know?
Tom came out the door.
Tom doesn't take a bus to school.
Hurry up.
It's snow.
We have to postpone the meeting.
Do you have a beer?
It's not that good. It's not that good.
I want you to see it as soon as possible.
Asi, you are not!
Tom is the last one.
I'm going to go swimming for a few moments.
I still have a lot to learn.
I know what this is about.
I only went to the driveway to give Tom a day-to-day gift.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
The wedding is tomorrow.
It's a recognised book in America.
I'll give you one good advice.
I'll try.
There's a message for you.
I'm not always home on Sundays.
Here's what you're gonna do, I'm gonna give you a break.
It's not my decision.
I bought it for my girl.
- Yours?
The investigation is ongoing.
I like provans.
Whatever.
Tom is barely alive.
I would never do that to Tom.
Please, I don't have all the time.
You're in the paint.
Hey, John, how are you?
Do not use the words "borš" and "cauliflower" in German.
Hey.
It won't be long now.
I'll learn from the background.
He's looking, he's looking.
Just stand there and help me clean it up!
You and Tom must be happy.
Here we go.
I had a shower before breakfast.
I will.
You kissed in the rain.
I'm Russian.
It's a lot easier than that.
We went to London.
More than that.
There's three cameras.
Tom put the door on the chain.
Didn't I?
It's a fact of life.
As long as he's still alive.
I have to wear boots.
I mean, you were Tom.
Here's this.
The subject was really very unfair.
The opinion is delivered by Tomb.
We have what we deserve.
I slept last night at 10:00.
We need to talk about this.
Do you mean in?
So this is what it is.
That's it.
I don't have anything to do with it.
The box was full of strawberries.
Yeah.
I'm an American singer.
Let's go, let's go.
Are you kidding?
One language never matters.
I was, and I needed a home.
He put everything in his jewels in a small red box.
What's your favorite dessert with strawberries?
He threw a hat in the back of the head.
I can't believe I said that.
Hey, it's me.
I'm awake.
The population of Estonia is about 1.4 million people.
I can hear some saxophones.
Help me!
My wife's trying to sleep.
I was working on it in the factory.
I'm going to go.
I'll see what I can see.
We went to the beach.
Do you have the right to table for two?
The 3rd of December is the Day of People with Disabilities.
Are you in trouble?
I didn't wake up.
He's trying to live.
She's sitting on the bench.
Is.
Paul was right about the two-legged Paul.
The wife drinks water.
There's a lot of pictures in this box.
A tiny, bright event can lead to an excellent result.
You did your best.
In Hungary I have the name Borat.
I'm a chicken.
Who have you been with?
I just want to know if you're in trouble.
- What's that?
They look all right.
This is the attitude here.
I'd like to borrow about a hundred thousand dollars.
Are you?
She turned her back on.
It seems that this is not a crime.
I think I'm out of money.
The book is on the table.
I'll see you at least once a week.
Shoot him, he'll tell me I'm talking.
It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
It's not.
This is the third week.
The money was worth a lot more than it was.
Language is my native language.
I didn't have to move it.
Come on!
I'm in.
It's hard to get this back bag.
I'm warning you, I'm warning you.
We're not.
I don't know.
It's okay.
Here we go now.
I'm going to call Tom again.
Do you have a vocabulary?
When's Tom coming?
Did you feel the Earth last night?
Is Tom aware that Mary did what she did?
They don't always go like we're gonna do.
What are you doing here?
Give me a bath, baby.
Can you do this?
I'll read this book.
Where's the hut?
Do you have any strawberries to drink?
Learn to read and read.
My eye, my eye.
is currently out of work.
What do you think if I met you two to three days a day for dinner?
Come on!
My mother wants me to learn in the soup.
I'm under the tree.
Does this letter have to be in English?
Did you like the bike?
What's your name?
What are you doing?
Get up, Tom.
Did you go?
Is that what I'm talking about?
There's a glass.
Have you understood your mistake?
It's for Baudelaire.
Who are they?
I don't know what to say to him.
Toms is trying to protect me.
He's in France three times.
How often do the buses go?
You're not local.
See you around.
My name is Roberto.
Is that enough?
What I remember most about the story was the last scene.
I'm a college student.
You should know what you mean.
Stay calm.
All the doors are locked.
Tom's got his own way in.
Good-bye!
We're working on it and we're resting on it.
The flower shop is right here.
It makes sense.
I'll do it without trouble.
Laus is fine.
He doesn't know.
I'm 12 years old.
Wash your hands off.
Come on!
They're the flowers of our lives.
The noise went up.
You're a bitch.
Here we go.
You want some?
My name is Hopkins.
He said he was alive.
Anything?
Flowers flourish.
How's that?
He likes to read books.
It got me into trouble at first.
You're giving her?
I have to go now.
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.
Whatever you want.
There are two cars.

Tom's today?
Dogs smell very sensitive.
Would you tell Tom I stopped by?
Lands are expensive for winter.
It's a house.
Thank you very much.
I know what to do.
- Is your son?
I've got a son.
I'll go and talk to Tom.
There's nothing we can do about it.
The greens are on their way.
Toms from our conversation.
This is my email address.
She's a woman.
Tom did not understand why Mary had made such a decision.
That's not the only thing I have to do.
have you?
Come on, Tom.
Years ago.
What's Tom doing lately?
I'm learning English.
Tom.
- Is it?
They don't have any.
I slowly opened the door.
I like the juice of coffee.
I'll take care of Tom myself.
Tom and I will be singing in May.
What?
Bees fly from flowers to flowers.
How much language was that?
There is no place in a world I can say I'm from that country.
Good afternoon, Muiel.
Let's help him if he can.
I've got a 98-AS-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S.
My name is Ricardo.

This is a very important story.
Life will be the day of life.
Wait a minute.
He told me.
Do you want to see a screenshot?
How are you?
This facility will be built in the city.
He'll be a good help.
The cat caught the pins.
I don't want to.
He's not.
Go on.
You're in third grade, right?
Now, I am.
Come on!
Apples are sweet.
Is that an English-skidded badger?
Let's go.
The leaf and the tree fall.
The cat is under the tree.
Come on.
A tom of moss.
South America is the largest country in the world.
Let's go back to work.
No, no, no, no.
Toms the heads down.
Today is today.
Yeah.
I'll try to find him for you.
I'll give Tom a message.
I'm fine.
There are many good things in life.
Please don't get involved.
What do I get from the store?
The car is ready.
He's a good student.
This bag is too heavy.
Did you have a drink with him?
He wants to borrow some money.

I mean, I...
You both have to go.
It's the house.
I'm glad that there are so many translations in this sentence already.
Doesn't that sound nice to you?
The train's going out at 9 o'clock.
This suite is over $50,000.
He does mean it.
Here you go.
I've made an incredible mistake.
Tom's hands are dirty.
Obviously.
How are you doing with Tom?
I had not had much choice.
You guessed that?
Did you have to share the room with your brothers and sisters?
You're very good-hearted.
I told Tomi.
I've been at the house.
What is your favorite and your crew?
This is a beautiful dress.
in my heart.
Tom is real.
An ambulance is about to arrive.
Carefully.

Omei!
Investigate more.
I'm Irish.

Can I pay by card?
I'm sick of it.
There's no salsa here.
Oi!
This apple is big.
Have a nice day of your own.

Good afternoon.
I like to drink.
I'm fine.
I ate a sandwich.
What are you doing?
Bees are social creatures.
Where was where?
I'll stay for you.

What do you want me to do?
Nice to see you.
I didn't understand.
I gave him a letter of love.
Taxi's waiting.
I think you're really busy.
Don't tell me about it.
He's not a long-term growth, but he's strong.
My father is stronger than your father.
Please close the window.
He's wearing a glass.
I'll make my cup of tea.
Looks like he's drunk.
I have a blue eye.
How did you get your nickname?
You hit it.
I'm the teacher.
My father is stronger than my father.
I do not believe in true love.
Toms with his own hand, right hand, Mary.
The door opens.
This camera over there is mine.
Lock the doors.
Tom grows the strawberries in his garden.
- Is it?
There's an amber.
Tom is the one with the car.
Get out.
I went to the cabin with a train.
Oh, yes.
They're watching.
What's wrong with you?
Ice.
Come on.
This is one of the largest cities in the world.
I'm not a Stock.
This cave is full of bats.
We're serious.
Tom spoke quietly to Mary.
against
No, no, no, no.
Are you ready?
It's before.
I'm really shy.
Say hello to your father for me.
"I'll order in time," I mean.
That's not a question.
It's a secret, I can't tell you.
They're coming.
Let's all die.
I want to borrow some money from you.
They're kind of weird out there.

Focus on your work.
It took me a while to change with a Russian accent.
Good night, everyone.
That's a simple way to say it.
I'll tell you something.
That's what this is.
Tom, tell me, and I'll get to know you anyway.
It's not that big of a deal.
I've never been able to get over my modesty, but I don't know what to do.
I have a tree.
I can't find Tom.
I won't hold back.
I wish I was you.
Whoa!
I'll do it next time.
They go away.
Good morning, sleepyhead.
You're famous.
Drink with me.
Tom doesn't like how Mary laughs.
Not all fascists have a Carousel election.
I wish I was next to you.
Quietly.
I cannot accept it.
What time do you have to go to bed?
He's embroidered his mother's signature.
You don't know what that is?
