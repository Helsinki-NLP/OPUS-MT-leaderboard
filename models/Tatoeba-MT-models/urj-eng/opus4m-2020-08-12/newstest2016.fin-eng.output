A 9-year-old son found a 9-year-old son who had escaped from the 19-year-old.
The police have had a search warrant for a 9-year-old boy's escape on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report for the son who left the West of Tampere with his friend has spread through the media.
According to the police, the boy has been contacted, and he has no danger of life or health.
The son's father told Ila-Sanom half-knows that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start some research.
Got away from the neighborhood of the house, didn't you?
Rozaldo's again in the heat - ripped the paint off the Messin.
Castiano Ronaldo struck five goals in the Spanish league during the weekend and continued to work in the Masters' league.
The battle between Lionel Messin and Cristiano Ronaldo from the league of the Champions League, turned to the final favour for at least a moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo, alone, reached the top of all the goals, when he shot a visitor to the Shahtar Donetsk network, two hits from the policy options and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal level to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess has 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Since the beginning, the announcement has been a failure in the British football league in Serie A, but in the D section of the League of Masters, it started with a strong 2-visual victory in the city.
The most powerful one was the 10 minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the ground was dulled by the absence of the kneecapper Sergei Aguro.
Aguro, who was injured in the election game during the week, only arrived at the field on one of the 10ths of the week.
In addition, the second company in the United States experienced a hard fight against PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands in support of the 1-2 loss.
Man's 20-year-old I.A.R. Luke Shaw's only needs a quarter of a hour.
The dangerously-looking release of PSI Hector Moreno hit the ManU package that was attacked towards the paint so badly that Shaw was likely to be cut off by the tibia.
Jeff lay on the lawn of the Eindhoven home stadium for a decade before the medical staff took him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy only lasted a few minutes.
Two times a week with more time.
In the second half of the period, the PSU's profit was made by Luciano Narsingh.
At the turn of the Masters of the Landing season, the A-block began Paris Saint-Germain.
The subject was the changed Argentinian Angel Di Maria to the United States shirt PSG.
Di Maria entered right through the right and raised the ball back past Malmo's goaltender, Jul Wilandin.
Edinson Cavani went to PSG for the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the

The function is not correct, but Malmö, a member of the too small-scale league, is not the best benchmark for comparison.
The main beneficiary of PG, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, met for the first time with his career's departure from Malmiö F.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes after his team lost in the B-block match in Moscow, Germany, to Wolfsügi 0-1.
The opposition requires immediate separation - the President gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe spoke in the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has once again spoken in the country in the same speech he gave last month.
Mugabe did not understand the same speech during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, a 91-year-old, was in full life.
The main opposition MDC insisted that Mugabe resigned because this is too old for the world.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that there was only Mugabe's presence and that he had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben spoke earlier and now about the impact of the country's economy on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria have a few additional summits on the refugee crisis.
Germany and Austria have been looking for the next six additional summits of EU leaders for the sake of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council to meet, will assess the opinion.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how more effective registration could be achieved in Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on asylum quotas are part of the Ministerial Conference.
The teacher tells the teacher that he shot during his own emergency call.
Sounding only a little bit of a color university teacher Shannon Lamb will tell the police during his emergency call that he shot at him and that he has to come back to them again.
She pointed out that she was alive and likely to be shocked, and said that the contact information of the dead woman's neighbours was available from the inside.
The home police found Amy Prentiss's body and anger on the side of the handwriting message: "I'm so scared that I could take off this beloved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me," said in a letter that says Lambin's signature.
No reference was made to the fact that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Cleveland Delta University in Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 1,000 kilometers to the school fair where he believes he had killed and killed the school teacher of that history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study room.
Chief of Police of the State University in Delta Lynn Buford told the staff of the University about the shooting at 10.18 am.
He said that Lambin made a fatal emergency call a while later.
By the end of the day, the number of people killed was one more:
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motives the day after the farmers and the staff had been hiding behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Researchers in both parts of the state have published information, according to which students and staff described Lamb as a creative teacher, where, of course, there was a problem.
The students told me they were waiting for his hours.
The police of Prints' death place, Gautier, says that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in his written book, where he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught social sciences and history in an institution with a total of 17 staff members, and many students participated in each course.
There were some signs of problems in mind.
The owner named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "it was as if something had been wrong".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said in the Lamb that he had a lot of fun at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
In the past, she had been sick from Delta State University saying that she had some kind of health problem.
This year he only learned two online courses.
Recent changes in university pay principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not give him automatic career development and post of assistant professor.
University principal William LaForge said that he knew there was no doubt between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "of course there was something in Lamb's mind".
These are questions that Lamb is no longer in a position to answer.
After Lamb had escaped from the exhibition, he ran away from him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Ar States.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself. A 38-caliber pistol in the back yard about one and a half kilometers from his parents' house in the first place of Mississippi Highville, reported death inspector Methel Johnson of Washington County.
Lambi's car was still in the driveway.
It wasn't quite clear why Lamb went to this house right now, even though Johnson said that he believed that Lamb was living there.
It grew up in the area.
I started working at the university in 2009 and studied mathematics and education. The university has 3500 people and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
He completed a doctorate in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and bright.
Carla Hairston reported that she was 15 years old and she was 20 years old when they met by common friends.
The Hairston fan was in the wind, and Lamb was fun, the guy who tried to teach Hairston for many years to play guitar.
He was quite a drummer those days ago.
They were all hot when he was there, and now he's 40-Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburbs, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently dating for a while.
On the emergency phone, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but they have no evidence whatsoever.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the river bank in Gautier.
He said he was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, reported that he was divorced 15 years ago, but left behind. They are now 19 years old.
"He's really upset," O'Sten described his son.
He was a friend of his mother's.
O'Steen told me that there was no one in Lamb, but he had probably heard from Abigail that she was one of the music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both present on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they used to play with each other with a bunch of gigs.
O'Steen told me that he would make and sing his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who was mostly a nurse for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, the bar and occasional entertainer of The Julep Room near Gauter, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night on the 5th day after Lamb had closed his guitar and lip gloss performances to the public.
Nothing seems to be wrong.
"Only a couple," he said.
We used to play games and we used to play tricks on each other.
So they were both quite clever.
A dead teacher, Schmidt, introduced a first-year student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, told school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of U.S. Emporia and was the president of his brothership and of the college board.
On Tuesday evening, in Cleveland, the Delta State Parliament held a candle alert, involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, to attend and to the Community.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also took part in the fair during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Monday, Wednesday.
"We're trying to get us to come back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to recover.
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Mississippi Cleveland.
Translation Press by Emily Wagner Pettus from Mississippi, Greenville, and Rebecca Santana New Orleans took part in the report.
It's been said that the police are now talking about Lamb's emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and that even though I referred to her as Prentiss during this conversation, there is no reason that they were not married.
Toys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for the match.
Toys R Us says that it does not pay as many jobs as it did last year, but the dealer of toy and baby products says that today's permanent and seasonal workers are given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to its own estimates, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while the number of employees paid in 2014 was 45,000.
Part of the work is part-time.
I said that the interviews of the applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
It is months to leave, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help you manage your stores and sell, post and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox is laughing about "tretting" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film "Back to the Future" was, of course, a huge moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also equal for personal reasons.
"We sat at the theatre waiting for the arrival of the royals, and I realized that I was sitting next to me empty, and then I realized that the place of Princess Dialan was at my place," he said, "and then he wrote a movie about the movies in Back in Time.
The movie starts and I'm thinking, "I'm just a job stop and a hand stretch away from dating the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time is a document about the film "Back to Life", interviewed by Foxa, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemecks and CEO Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future was received 30 years ago in the first place.
Spielberg said, "To me, it is definitely the greatest time travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available in subscription, DVD and some movie theaters.
The President of the United Nations says that Syria does not resolve the Syrian process in an armed manner.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's response to the fact that Russia's increased military support to Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "is not being remedied" and that more weapons only exacerbate violence and the suffering of people.
The United Nations has once again called on all parties, including the feared UN Security Council, to unite and support any non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
In a press conference on Wednesday, Ban reported that he was going to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five Member States that are staying - the United States, the United States, the United States, the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom - in the context of the General Assembly ministry later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted the fact that the complexity of the Council, the Syrian people and the forces of the region "is impossible to resolve."
(b) called on the five Member States to demonstrate, in the context of the discussion of the Syrian Act, the kind of humanity and consensus which they would make in the context of the implementation of the Iranian programme.
8 support for the result that shows that Donald Trump is really real.
Some people have tried to make him public.
Others just think he's a badass.
There's a lot of confusion to look forward to.
Although some Republicans have tried to keep Donald Trump off the top of the support polls, it has not (we) failed.
In the 10th of the last 11 national surveys, Donald Trump has been in charge of a two-digit series, and some have begun to think seriously about what this means to name a real estate king.
Of course, it is only early in the day.
This does not necessarily mean that Trump is likely to become a candidate for the Republican Republican.
The commentators point out that Rick Perry was at this point in 2011 losing his leadership over the emerging Herman Cain, both of which did not get back from the state in the nomination process.
There is also a reason why we should be in general elections.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Association for Growth have noted the tenacity of Trump and started to use its means to cover him.
The following recent statements of support polls suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing step:
The history of popularity has been translated into a complete translation.
Before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth’s support survey showed that only two out of ten Republicans welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-May, the figure was 40%.
August was 22 per cent.
Currently, six of the six Republicans are being treated by Donald Trumpin.
About three out of ten says they're reacting differently.
These figures are also valid in the first pre-election States.
In a support poll at the University of Quinn in Iowa, the last 60 per cent of the Republicans said that they welcomed Trump.
Two thirds of the Republican speakers would be pleased if Trump were to be elected.
In the first half of CNN/ORC, 67% of the Republicans said that they would be either "inspired" or "satisfied" if Trump were one.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "freaked", that I would make a decision.
Only Ben Carson brings about approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (4% of "innovation" vs. Trump 40%).
Is the next greatest reason for this?
Marco Rubo is only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be "unsatisfied" or "mad", and the Presidents' favorite Jeb Bush would be the candidate.
The nature of the Trums game is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his dazzling speeches and insults, according to the Monday ABC News/Washington Post, 52% of the voters who are on the side of the Republican side at national level think that the real estate king has the right quality to mark.
According to the light market survey last week, in the Iowa State of the First Party, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has the right quality for the president.
However, according to the ABC/Past survey, 44% of people think that he or she does not work as a judge, and nearly three out of ten think that he or she is not part of the House of the Great.
Republicans get used to the idea.
When Republicans think like commentators, they think Trump is a real option.
According to CNN/ORC’s survey, four out of ten considered Trump to be the most likely alternative to asking who is most likely to be nominated as candidates for the Republican Republican.
At the end of July, four of the four teams supported Jeb Bush.
Release of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the most recent possible planet at their disposal.
Over the course of this election, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was nominated as a candidate, and only 28% of the final candidate, Mitt Romney, was in favour of the final candidate.
In any case, this shows that most of the Republican voters consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
The Republican Republic would be in favour of the second candidate, Trump would still win almost anywhere.
Some commentators have pointed out that a sickle field is likely to have contributed to Trump's leadership, as the support against Trump has taken place between numerous other candidates.
However, the survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that, in the inevitable bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republicans, Trump will receive the majority of the support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bushia at 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasichia and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
The first winning candidate?
If they were the opposite of the gun, Ben Carson would win the player Trumpin with a big 18 point difference.
Right now, most of Donald Trump's supporters have been told that they have made a decision.
The New CBS/NY survey on Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump's pro-voting voters decide who to vote for themselves.
The situation can, of course, change, and no one can be sure to say that they would never change their mind.
46% said that they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trumbi's biggest player at present is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely to be on the right side.
Six out of six Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been in the middle of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trumpi's focus is driving Latin players further from the Republican Party and is causing injury to rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are in agreement with Trump on immigration.
It seems that as long as immigration is at the heart of things, there is also Donald Trump.
Freeing up to the population has reached the new top.
The support for Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican rectors, largely due to their role outside politics.
Six out of six Republicans said in the ABC/Post interview on Monday that they would choose as if they had a government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register/Balmberg's survey of Iomaa showed that three of the four Iowa Republican Republics have been frustrated in the Republic of the Republic: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% are "really angry".
The Prime Minister's Question Time for Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance in the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby's first appearance in the Question has been eagerly expected from his choice.
The new President of the Labour Labour Party, Jeremy Corby, will meet David Cameron for the first time in a quarter of a quarter of a year.
Corby asks about his first six questions shortly after noon, and most likely both the public and the Labour Party members were careful about his performance.
Corbyn has called for this weekly statement to be "less theatre and more facts".
He has also said that some of the times he has to deal with his colleagues could be left to him.
This encounter is the first formal test of Corbyn's leadership after he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke to the trade union center at the annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision of the President of the Labour Party to stand up during the National Song on Tuesday's Memorial Service, held on the 75th anniversary of the World War of Combating the United Kingdom, has been a cause to be rejected by the Conservatives with the representatives of the people and has appeared in several front pages.
Corbyn's decision not to mention the national song has been taken into account.
The representative of Corbyn spoke with due respect and acknowledged that he "recognised the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the Great British Air War."
Mr Corbyn's board member, Owen Smith, stated to the BBC Twon Newsnight programme that he would have called on the working party to sing the national laureate, despite the fact that he should be suspended in his mind.
Almost a dozen prime ministers have refused to participate in Corbyn's inner circle, arguing for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences of policy regarding the role of political parties in the European Union and the government's support ceiling are also "assessed" within the working population after the appointment of Corbyn.
Corby said at a meeting of the Federation Centre that the working party would propose an amendment that would remove the whole roof.
A few hours later, Secretary of State and Minister of State, Smith, noted that the party was "very clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to put a ceiling of 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Force President, who David Cameron has been in contact with in the last decade, when he has been president of the Conservative Party.
The Labour Party President has promised a new approach to politics, and now he says that he has "combined" ideas for the Prime Minister, and has received over 30 000 proposals.
Mr. Corby, President of the Islington North, has said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Times is too counterbalanced and that he intends to refrain from both clever words and stuttering, but instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corby has said that Angela Eagle, Secretary of Economics of the Board of Directors, is in place of her for interviews when Corby does not attend - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also suggested that other colleagues should be able to speak in a real way, and he has shown that he has approached the chairman of the House, John Bercow, from the team.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that we wanted to move further away from the political theatre that is most often brought together in the final Question Time, but he had to admit that he had failed later.
Since their launch in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important indicator for the assessment of the President's discretion, his sub-room management, and his position among other Members of the people, even though the critics have criticised the questions that they have become only a whimsical image that requires far-reaching reforms.

The weight of the pound is rising as the UK wage growth rises as the UK wage wage growth rises as the UK wage wage growth rises, as the UK wage growth rises as the UK wage growth rises, the UK's wage wage growth rises as the wages rises
The value of the pound jumped upwards after the figures seemed to be coming up at the UK's wage increase, while at the same time the FTSE 100 index reached the tender target with SABMiller.
Between May and July, wages and salaries of the United Kingdom, excluding bonuses, went up by 2.9 per cent over the last year.
The fall rate was on track after 2009 and was considered to be accompanied by an assessment of the rise in the course.
The pounds rose by more than one dollar to $1.505, and by $0.9 per cent to € 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index dropped by 1.49% to a total of 6229,21.
SABMILLER was the most discrete stock on the market and again 20% after it was supported by the competitor AB InBev.
One of the two largest plants in the world and one of the other brands, such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peron and Grolsch.
The Burberry stock rose by 0.9% after the encouraging news from Richmont from a group of competing luxury products.
The latest sales figures in the market were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in the industry - which is the Burberry's single market - had begun to grow again.
Glenho's shares rose by 5% after the miner told me that it had imported $2,50 billion by re-calculating shares as part of its debt-cutting strategy.
Package and Paper Group The share share of Timi was 4.3% of the largest in the index after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendation from the company to "sold".
JD Sports rose by 3.1% after the Dutch company disclosed the information six months before taxes: 83% increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to the Director of JD Times, higher wages may harm enlargement.
Peter Cowgill, Director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for employees is raised in the United Kingdom, it can mean that "the power of potential consumers is growing".
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed higher labour costs for the company, says Cowgill.
The costs could be related to the company's expansion plans, which would increase the number of more jobs.
Metcash will launch a grass-root campaign against the invasion of Aldi.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA business from Aldin's attack on South and West Australia.
The wholesaler of food Metcash has launched a grass-root campaign to support the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's 700 million attacks.
Aldi is preparing for two distribution centres and the first opening of the market early next year in South and West Australia, which are still 120 trades, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build the IGA brand through the mainstream and social media markets and through events such as Adelaide Drive.
IGA traders and buyers have jumped in, and brands such as Simmo's ice cream manufacturer, Dunsborough, are offering you a great deal of goods in IGA stores, and retailers are selling low-priced tickets to their customers from Australia.
It is expected that Metcashin will disclose more details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when it will be the end of the annual investment day for wholesalers of food, alcohol and commodities.
There is a lot to be played, since South and West Australia account for almost 40% of Metcashin's IGA transactions, and the margins are higher than that of Metcashi's Eastern States.
The visitors to the purchases in South and West Australia are known to be a whole country, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the north and 24% in the west of the eastern 14%.
Analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe, however, that Aldi will catch about 5% of these two markets in the EU within 12 months of opening the first movements.
In his report this week, English English Analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers will be able to make up to $360 for sale and Metcash will be able to lose $250 by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25th and 30th in the West, which will generate a turnover of between 500 and 600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at Metcashi's high flat-rate cost base can pay Metcashi about $13 million in operating losses before wages and taxes, said Kierath.
The same means that Metcash is a market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although in the recent Roy Morgan investigation it was found that IGA customers were the most credible in all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcashi’s food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10 per cent in 2020.
Last year's manager and founder of Magellan Financial Company, Hamish Douglas, said during a business lunch in Melbourne, that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade".
Metcash has refused to reply publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that the President of Metcashi would have contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, the market share of IGA has decreased from 18% to 14%, and the outputs from Metcashi's food and food business, which distributes products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012.
However, the wholesaler holds half, and has imported more than 150 million dollars of goods per week at the same price as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to renovate stores by increasing the higher volume of fresh food, as well as importing a better choice of private brand products.
Mr. Metcashin Ian Morrie says that the calculation and improvement of prices and sales have increased the appeal, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of growth in income in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Australia's President of the Tenure Union Steve Healya supports Thanasi Kokkinakis.
Tranasi Kokkinakis deserves more honor than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer on the side of the last night, which has been hurried around Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own conduct, says President Steve Healy of Australia's tenure.
Mr. Kokkinakis, called "special Ks", is by no means a member of the general public in a case where Kyrgios was an agitating member of the Stan Wawrrrikada at the Oceania Masters Competition.
Shortly thereafter, the chief judge in Cincinnatit, first of all, failed to separate Cooking and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, when he declared: "Wawrik should have hit Kyrgios, and I should have hit that kid."
Every single one of them was last seen disbanding their country since the crash ruined his possible victory from Richard Gasquet at US Open, Healy has been a hard-core security guard for the Cook.
Now a gentleman in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth for a second place in doubles with Bernard Tomi in the Davis Cup physique against the United Kingdom.
"I'm pretty strongly of the opinion that you've just been dragged along," said Goody.
He broke his country to lose because of the split at US Open, but he is not the first player to break his country in his frustration, and I know that Tranas is not himself enough to know that he is not.
However, he has been doing very well, including in extremely provocative situations with the US Open with Harrison and so on, and deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a nice circle around him, and I think I've been treated a little hard.
She's very mature at 19 years of age, she works hard, she's on the team and so on, and she's never been a problem with other players. She's highly valued in the locker room, she's working hard, she's in good shape and she's a very calm and mature young man, and I think I should appreciate what she deserves.
Welly has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgyz in any of the important games that begin, describing this "common plan" as a good decision for everyone, but still supporting the return of Canberra to the team's standard platform.
"We want the team to be completely focused on games, not all around [Kyrkgios]," Healy said.
And Nick has been very quick, as the Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he grows up in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has given him. However, we are trying to help him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public thinking about these consequences.
European Migration: In order to declare an emergency, border, to arrest immigrants, to bring about a crisis.
The country declared an emergency and shut down its international border against Georgia, holding back those who were willing to enter the country in the illegal state.
There was chaos along the border as hundreds of immigrants were formed in the area of the Party, and the Serbian authorities reacted with a knockout.
The people who fled their homelands of violence have now been able to set up their tents and have been on the road between inspection stations in two countries for an indefinite period.
Appendix figure 3.
While staying in the fire, immigrants in front of them were saying, "Open the border!" and calling for violations to the Hungarian riot police.
They begged for food and for action to resist.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it is "impossible to approve" migrations from Hungary when there is more and more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece all the time.
"(Serbia) is a part of the solution, it does not harm civilians.
Discussions are needed with neighbouring countries and countries," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The confusion at the border between Hungary and Serbia was born after the fact that the group of ten nationalities failed to establish a common immigration policy in a controversial discussion in the debate.
Ministers agree on the division of responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers, who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers are looking forward to reaching a final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries 120,000 more refugees, including some of Hungary.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an additional EU summit next Tuesday, which will discuss the immigration crisis in the country.
I would like to point out that the Commission's proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
On Tuesday, the emergency in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to act in crisis and enabled them to close down and decide on the right of asylum cases.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that now that I am ready at the border with Serbia, the country will also set up a land for a part of its border against Romania to stop a flooding country through the land.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners had been recruited to last the lead wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last month, Hungary has become the largest bottleneck and arrival for refugees from the European Union, who are in war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are homeless people looking for life in the future, and not those who are vulnerable to protection - this is a strong change with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at the centre of Hungary, are now setting the company up for the purpose of crossing or causing damage to a 4-metre (13 ft) ridge fence that has been built on the south-west side of the country, and contain a longer prison for convicted human traffickers.
"Because of the fact of mass immigration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency," informant Zoltan Kovács told journalists in the south of Szeged.
In fact, it is quite clear: crossing the law is.
Parliament must continue to accept the general public's position expected for the first week, but the reporters of the Associated Press at the border have seen, for days now, heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs.
Orban's Homeland Security Adviser Gyorgy Bakni said that 45 people had been caught by those who were trying to cross the border, as well as 15 more than once.
They got over the fence by hurting them, now they're under the control of the world, and they're being accused of new laws for certain crimes.
The authorities are going to fix the fence quickly.
On Tuesday morning, the Hungarian officials also closed two of the two crossing points against the border with Serbia, after they had sent a truck covered with silicon wire to one of them.
The main crossing point near Hungary's Roske was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small box of machines for handling people and forced the people to enter.
About 20 entrances in, but thousands were excluded.
A group of immigrants between Serbia and Hungary say that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to come home.
2016 matches: According to the National Survey, the leading director of Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders is narrowed down on the side of Bernie Sanders.
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton will continue in a two-digit lead in the democratic roll-call, but Senator Bernie Sanders has him held up.
Clinton now supports 47% of democratic voters (reduction of 58%) and the second Mr. Sanders now supports 27% (increase of 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential contest, but he supports 15% of the Democrat voters.
Five months before the beginning of the primary elections, most of the democratic voters say it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
Clinton's supporters, however, stand behind their own choice at the most than other candidates' supporters.
Clinton's popularity has fallen among the population since last month's CBS News Poll survey, while at the same time the States has risen somewhat.
Clinton is firmly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership is narrowed.
The score between these two is calculated by the factor, and Sanders is only 5 over.
Clinton's distance to the over 50-year-old anti-pollutionists has disappeared, and he's now even with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with the parents among the voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders with a double number of liberals, but now Sanders is running this group with five units.
About half of the country's democraticists say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm if I become a party candidate.
Fourthly, he supports him with his own reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is.
The moon would not support this at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be keen on his mind.
The opinions are more confusing for those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - just a fourth of them would be eager to support him.
Where 48% of the democratic voters say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the first of the Republicans to speak of Donald Trump is the less-favoured Republican rector (3 %).
On the open question asked by Clinton's supporters why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%), and then the most popular answers were that now is the right time for a female (13%) and that he is the best score (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 %).
The same terms and the opportunity to be heard were also relevant.
Since the Vice-President has an influence on the possible presidential candidate, 57% of the democraticists would like to see him in the race - although one third of them disagree.
When asked about the dissidents they chose the other party's name, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half says that they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than the Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue democratic candidacy, the head of Hilary Clinton will be replaced by Sanders. If Biden comes along, the management will be 20 points, but if he leaves, the chapter will be 30.
55% of the Democrats believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
At this point, Bide remains long, but the ones who hold him most to vote have grown.
When asked what was most important about the candidate, however, they raised opinions to be put to the vote.
In any case, last month, none of the Democrats or potential candidates are considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates are very well placed in certain key issues among the party voters.
The majority of them consider Clint, Sam and Biden to be playing, reliable and strong leaders.
From the Biden three to the best of all, while Clinton's strength is the driving force.
Thirty percent of the Democrats say that they don't think Clinton is true and reliable, which is more than only (15%), but 27% say they don't have an opinion about Sanders.
Democraticists in general also believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are in agreement with the ideology.
When we look at all of these, about a quarter of the demersalists say that they have no opinion on Sanders.
While the use of Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and address in his capacity as Foreign Minister is still under way, the majority of the voters are pleased with his explanation of the matter and say that there is no public opinion about him.
However, this is different when we look at the whole of America.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about one third of them are out of their minds.
In the morning, public opinion was announced shortly after the day-to-day light came on.
The majority of the Americans say that they do not have an impact on their common sense of Clinton, even though 36% of them say that they are disillusioned.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their own Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him to be true and reliable, this is still a matter for all the registered voters. Only 32% of them consider him to be true and reliable, and this figure has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since today.
62% of the registered voters say that they do not think Clinton is true and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters registered throughout the country do not believe Trumps to be real and reliable either.
Both Clinton and Trump are considered to be good leaders.
Six of the candidates involved in the study Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most important.
Sanders is generally considered to be true, but many people have no opinion of him, just as they do of Carson.
The error margin of the investigation, which involved 351 matches, is 6.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump at a national summit.
Carson will be near Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times.
Two candidates collected half of all the votes on the new news, leaving the others fighting for a foothold.
Throughout the country, the Republicans continue to strongly support Trump, whose support has risen from 23 % to 27 % of the CBS's 10th quarter of the previous month's Fox News debate on Tuesday.
However, Jason rose from 6% to 23% in the same way.
It is also a question of Carson among the very different demographic groups and is being replaced by Trump’s higher-ranking Republican rectors.
The rest of the field is behind, except Cary Fiorina and the Governor of Ohio, John Kasichi. The support of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen from 10% to 2% last month.
The former President of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of the United Nations, Mike Huckabee and the Senator of the Florida, Marco Rubio, are ranked at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this latest 376 Republican rector of the September survey is +/- 6 %.
The last poll last published by CNN/ORC survey showed that Carson was in the middle of the question: he has 19% support for the Republican Republican Republic, and Trump is in his 32nd position.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was much ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last time, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgeon for being too much, even though Carso for pardoning Trump's belief in him.
"We need energy", Trump played last night on his campaign visit to Iowa.
The fifth member is charged with the death of Baruch?
Almost two years after the death of the fraternity's embalming ceremony in the Pennsylvania Pocono Mountains, the murder charge has been raised against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Group of the Baruch College University in New York City genuinely visited Chu during the "Michael" Deng membership dispute in September 2013, and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thereby contributing to his death, said the police.
The authorities say that Deg's eyes were tied and his back loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, and then he was repeatedly tamed when he was looking to walk through the ice field towards the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head would be hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The members of the Board of Directors did not call the emergency number after Deng fainted, but, according to the accusations, they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, they say.
However, they had time to change their search for Deg, to look for information on his symptoms on the web, and to contact the National President of the Church of the United States, Andy Meng, asking for advice, Chief of Police Chris Wagner, at a press conference.
"This is where the members of this section were able to hide their ritual equipment and thus, in reality, put the well-being of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," said Chief Wagner.
Deg was not given a break, and he died the next morning.
According to the Mortgage Protocol, Deng was repeatedly hit by a dull object in the head, body and thigh.
"More than one member of the family has had to suffer from the exorcism of the brotherhood, when at least one person is dead as a result of it ever since," said Doug Fierberg, a representative of Deg, in his statement.
Governments and they must be given responsibility, and this is an important step.
The large court in the county of Monroe supported the fact that the first members were charged with the murder of a third party.
32 other brothers, including Meng, are also accused of violent mutilation and of plotting the enemy.
"We do not want to be held responsible only for individuals. If there is something behind what has happened that is going on, either in public or in informal terms, who will also be held responsible", Wagner stated in the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch Ž banned the Church and the Church of England from liaising with the Central Unit.
This happens when the United States increases the ratio.
The interest rate rise is coming, and the rising market for prices is falling, the yields of bonds are falling and the economy is going to decline.
This is it.
What we don't know is how much longer it takes or how long it takes.
The past does not allow much time to pass on to the economy.
After the first increase, the return has taken just 11 months, while the return is as long as the end of the month.
The aggressiveness of the United States central bank in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a determining factor in the way in which the economy and financial assets are managed.
On the other hand, the officials of the United States have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on the fact that interest rates are starting to rise, but rather on the development of the time to normalisation.
There are definitely several variables in the equation.
However, in the end, market participants may find that all the stress increases have been overstated.
"The first increase in the central bank's post-global economic crisis is necessarily interpreted in some circles at the end of the 'bad money' period," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economics Officer at Capital Economics.
Instead, we do not expect the United States to return to normal, even though still too much, to a normal state of stability that many people feel is changing.
That doesn't mean that it would.
There is an overview of how some of the economic areas will come to life on the basis of previous developments:
As seen in the market over the past six months, waiting for weight gain can make the situation unstable.
When the promotion becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital has tended to reach 12-12 months after the first interest, which, in turn, may reflect the delay in monetary policy," the GE Bank investigators said in the open investigation about what would happen after the weighting of the central bank.
In other words, over the last 35 years, the market is generally stable, at about 14% at the end of the call, after 250 days the situation is moderate (average 2.6%), and the normal value has been reached after 500 days of average return in the sixth period of 14.4%, reported in the final analysis of the most recent capital strategy of Asset Management, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deuce Bank, the influence on the shares is generally closer at a later point in the increase cycle when the yields begin to fall.
The recessions are a part of the economy, but they often improve their income.
In the present situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously existed and which can stimulate the recession.
This is particularly the domestic product, which will be closest to the lowest ever before the central interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, at 118 increases since the year, nominal annual GDP has only been once more than half a per cent.
In the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, while few believe it will remain, as the third quarter has reached 1.5 per cent, reports the Atlantic Federal Reserve Bank.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economic situation can be risky and wondering if "this is different", Deutsche Bank noted.
Market participants are booked for the central bank's increase all year round, and everyone is waiting for this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting to end on Thursday.
For example, a number of methods and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the change in this context, with the aim of calculating the probability of a 25 % probability of general government trading.
"Our research shows that since the year 1950, all the increasing cycles have been present in the superspheres of the increasing leverage effect, where the heat has passed the recession very quickly since the start of the recovery," the report reports.
On the other hand, the process has been quite slow to recover from the recession that has been the worst in the day.
In the present period, the central bank has been looking at the most distant end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now 74 months already in progress.
Production has also been unstable in the face of the market, and the model is a bit of a capital-driven product.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its heading, its effects are seen in documents more easily than in shares.
The trend in the yields of the bonds seems to change immediately with respect to the first increase/outturn of the cycle.
At the end of the lifting cycle, the yield of the bonds shall be calculated immediately", Deuce Bank said.
Mr. Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will result in a combination of income from longer-term and short-term securities, thus equalising the yield curve.
Output bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "we are still careful to look for a profit", stated Schwab's fixed-income analyst Kathy Jones in one analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank's premises.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the fall in inflation expectations, there are several factors that the market has adapted to tighter monetary policy positions," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the yield is evener, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are the best in the market when the bank has tightened its policy.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States can win when the ratios rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies, which have a lot of debt, earn worse when the value of each product makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they are making.
"Historical evidence shows that 'quality' shares are usually cheaper in the three months after the first interest rate increase," Goldman Sachs’ analysts noted to customers in their final report.
Enterprises with net turnover passed low turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital and low volatility shares did more than lower-quality companies. First, the average was 4 (percentage) and the highest was 3 (percentage).
You're gonna be a big problem.
Those companies that owe a lot of variable interest are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to the stock exchange speculation, consumers too have a chance at the expense of a dollar.
Savings can also benefit from higher incomes, even though experts disagree on how effective the effect works.
BBC Radio is the second of a single FM," says MP Andrew Bingham.
The Conservative Republic of Andrew Bingham is charged with the "nationalization" channel.
He claims that its separation from a commercial trader is becoming increasingly common.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just copying the British Awards.
The Voicea is criticised by Damien Collins, a Member of the European Parliament, saying that it is neither original nor original.
BBC IN 3 is a "changing" classic FM, claims the leading MEP, adding the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial companies do not do.
Conservative Congressman Andrew Bingham also said to the Directors of the BBC that the public service radio is saying "national law" and that it is more and more difficult to say about another competitor.
"It seems that the term "nationalism" is becoming a Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards Prize Gala, which was launched last year.
"Last year's BBC Music Awards only look different from the British Awards Gala organised under different names.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two things I really remember about, in fact, just one thing you already found on the market," Bingham said.
The BBC contested the accusations that BBC Radio 3 is much more than a commercial competitor in relation to live music and the sharing of information to the public.
Inter 3 teaches some things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
In fact, its commitment to living music and music is of the highest quality.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 has committed itself to new music and new works," he said.
Earlier this year, the manager of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, argued that the channel must do more than previously to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of BBC's offer that was criticised for taking up commercial competitors during the hearing of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Member of the Conservative Tory Party, Damien Collins criticises The Voice, the music competition bought by the BBC from a Dutch producer company, Talpa Media, estimated to be 22 percent.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is neither original nor in any way original?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1-channel program, where Paloma Faith and Boy George are the stars, was produced "in a very BBC style".
added that he wants a copy of the "find a living house" once it's finished.
However, he did not agree to interfere with the future seasons of The Voice, or to decide that the money of the promiseers would be spent on other forms of entertainment.
The net sales were the least in the past few months, and Black Friday may be the cause of this.
Net sales fell by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015 in the first three months of the year.
Last month the trend was at a low rate after the start of statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales made the use of mobile devices to make purchases.
Experts believe that I'm Black Fria may be responsible for consumption.
Virtual purchases have increased sharply for more than a decade and turned many British shopping into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption of August grew most recently in the year 2000: only five per cent from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures only accounted for 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and come back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be in order over time," Andy Mulcahy, supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
It explained that, three years ago, online sales strengthened when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be done under different conditions, such as a couch.
Now it is balanced, and (growth) can fall.
The issue of Black Friday from the United States is one of the main reasons behind the slowdown in trade.
Experts believe that consumers will control the purchase before the last night.
Over the last year, the average number of buyers that visited their computers was increasing by 3 pcs.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, who got the buyers to argue about the findings, can make purchases.
In a study published by the British Retail consortium, it was found that only about one in a dozen of the five networks were online.
More than a third of purchases are now made online of certain products, such as televisions and machines.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy work and shoes from the network instead of using shoplift fashion chains.
Muslims are burying the deaths of Mecca's heavy-duty accident, the sanctions for Bin Laden's family.
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies across the streets during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly been accused of the breakdown of the building leaven Saudi Binlain in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured when the crane turned down.
29 people were killed in the air across the streets when hundreds of Muslims met to bury them.
In the main proceedings, the guilty mourners filled the route with respect for the first of the dead who made their last trip to Al-Moaisim cemetery.
The sad passage passed by the sacred place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and overthrowed the worshipers.
The tombs were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia caused the Bin Laden family to be desolate by the building company, which also killed 3 4 people.
The killing of the upheavals that fell in our big mosaic was carried through the streets of the streets by the bodies of the farmers.
Among the dead were the four children's father, Qasim Akram from Bolton, in the region of Manchester. He was on his first pilgrimage when the nostalgic currant broke down.
Akram had been in a major shop with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the Hajj Mecca will move when they arrive in the world.
President Salman said that the Binlatin Group should not have left the crane on when it was not in use.
In the ambiguity version of the decision published by Saudi Press Agency, led by the State, it was said that the Binladin Group is partly responsible for the appeal.
The U.S. U.S. service did not understand this detail, but it said that the managers of the company would not be allowed to move abroad.
Earlier this year Salman swore that he would understand what caused the nostrils to fall into the courtyard of the Great Moscow, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had taken place before this month's event.
The Binladin Group has not published any information on the severe shock, and its representatives have not been caught up for comment.
The king’s decision also accused the group of failing to keep up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the cyclotorologists.
There are tens of the upheavals around Meka's major mosaic, which are part of the huge building unit run by the Binlatin Company.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruling family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
The late President of Al-Qiida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel son who was banned in the 1990s.
The breakdown took place in wind and rain weather only for days before millions arrive in their Word for pilgrimage, which every competent Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities are telling us that 1 1 is still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a large sum of Ralal (14,000 pounds) to pay to the families of the dead as well as to those permanently injured.
The others get half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that those working for the East Europeans who work for them are a good thing behind them.
The Brits increasingly use assistant services, says Vernique Laury.
The number of officials coming from Eastern Europe is behind this.
As a result of the opening of the Screwfix trades for professionals, 200 more will be added.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes a 60 B+Q store all over the country.
author Rupert Steiner, the leading author of the magazine Daily Mail.
The Brits say that they give up their hammers and paint pelts, and that they are the most skilled Eastern European workers to do domestic work.
It seems that if you're a pin with a hammer or a hack to paint the walls, you're in the majority now.
The British see that more and more assistants are hired to do their own job at home, says the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new owner of the retailer's shop, said that the success behind it was the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they were offered their services at a price of ridicule.
This results in Kingfisher planning to open up 200 new Screwfix shops for workers and close down the 60 B&Q store.
Lary said that she wanted more women to work in B&Q storehouses because of the fact that four out of ten shopping decisions are just making the nicest sexes.
Today, most of the staff are men.
It felt that changes in the poor should be taken into account: there is now more economy in which there are more domestic purchases than before.
Laury said: "The majority of our store staff are still men.
We need to choose better balance.
However, half of our customers are moderate, and 80% of the products are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the only five women who run the most important companies in the FTSE100 index in the United Kingdom. He has restated his position so that there are as many men and women in it as there are men and women in it.
He is the only company with a population equal to 50 % of women, including the general budget and the financial director.
The man said: "This was a conscious decision - the difference is a matter of fact.
There has been no difficulty in getting the good lead."
Bankisher reported an invoice for both six months of both income and sales after the company took over the cost of closing stores.
In line with the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Crewfix and B+Q stores, is renewing 200 new movements.
The three women decided to resort to a coercive law to save the economy.
Visual effects are expected to be quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other CICs began to turn immediately, and the country is lying down because of the widespread manifestation of workers.
Many people also believe that there is reason to be.
Let's ask if it's worth a strike when each one goes badly.
A resistance business has even been established.
Over 50,000 people are already reporting that they are not going to participate in the protest but are going to work.
For the good old consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where you protest, but openly declaring yourself true would have been a human being.
One million-member trade unions, thousands of protests by thousands of people, do not repeat much, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the online communications movement is no longer as clear as it was twelve years ago.
Not all are familiar with the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement’s operation, Government’s radical decisions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have been showing up on their own for years, then, of course, in connection with matters such as the right to defend, be aware and correct.
In this way, the government may want to hold back the role of the ay movement, when membership in the trade union is often seen as the most important in the past.
Whatever the opinion of the organisations is, it's nonsense that one's expression would somehow end up in Finland.
Finland has long since returned to Finland.
For example, industrial production has been down 31 months in a row for example.
Gross domestic product continues to fall and unemployment is increasing.
Things are supposed to force everything to the head.
The University of Lappeenranta is a hard-to-use economy: Aim for a million savings, with 130 employees.
The Technical University of Lappeen Beach is starting a continuum, which aims to reduce costs by a total of EUR 1 000.
□ the Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EEC) No 4077/92 on the common organisation of the market in agricultural products.
In practice, it means about 130 employees.
Other activities are also intended to save a lot of money.
In the context of the single market negotiations, the 2016 budget, which foresees that the actual functioning of the budget is a total deficit.
The budget of the Government is also responsible for this.
This year, the university will spend approximately 2.6 million consecutive years.
In the first instance, the growth rate is low, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry is reduced by 2 and other funding by 3.2 euros.
The total budget of the university is about 85 euros, which means that the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combination of massive education and research interventions and corporate finance with our university is very important, says Rector Anneli Pauli at the University's briefing.
The effects of the interventions appear to be even more pronounced before the summer, but now the reduction in the number of interventions will appear in new proportions.
The compromises with the judges will be launched next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Happy is what Finland wants to do for the rest of the world.
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in going to Finland for rail transport.
My Stagecoach is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail is expected to be open to competition in the future.
One of the next short-term economies of the metropolitan area is in 2017-2018.
There will be long-distance transport after transport.
Soutter tells us that he has already approached the Ministry of Economy.
In the transport sector, YLE says that Onnibus's plans are welcome.
Other international public interest in rail transport has been expressed at least by Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in Europe.
It is up to the Central Bank to make decisions on the ratio.
The rest of the world follows the side when the United States meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to set the ratios for the first time in almost a decade.
In Reuters' second-hand 80 economists, just over half of those who still believe in the latest central bank raising interest rates now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and the interest rates are still maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, because when you cut the equations to zero, it is a seven-year period.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the opportunity to get away from the zero level and start to normalise the ratios", said Angel Ubide, the one-stop Institute for International Economics.
The United States has worked well and has imported billions of dollars in the balance sheet and created little inflation.
However, the Centre cannot ignore less rosy, global views.
It has asked the market to be ready to raise, but it also suggests that they believe that the odds are against the increase.
The public will be published on Thursday at 2:00 (Cet).
The Delta State month shooter left a explanatory message.
After taking off in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting at him later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message that said you were "damaged" about the first murder and wished you could "retire it", they said the other Tuesday.
Mississippi’s Gautier police told me that Delta State Science and Social Science teacher Lamb called the emergency number at about ten o’clock in the morning.
Monday morning and told me that he had shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said, "He killed his wife last night," and he also said that there's a "salved" in the house, "no," but he's probably upset.
He asked the caller about this, but he didn't.
Lamb did not give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a message hand-held by a 45-year-old Lamb who reads, "I'm so hoping I could cancel it.
Amy and she were the one who ever loved me."
After writing the message, the distance between the two miles to the Delta State, where he was a history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, before he was finally able to miss his absence on Monday to encircle him.
University principal William LaForge said that he knew there was no doubt between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "of course there was something in Lamb's mind".
On Tuesday, the authorities said that all the claims that Lamb would have believed in Prentiss's relationship with Schmidt that there was no "legal knowledge or evidence" of any "three-thirds" of the claims made on Monday.
Shawn O'Steen spoke with Prentiss for about three years and described him as "the second human".
Couple of divorces 15 years ago, but stopped standing.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, who is "freaked".
O'Steen told me that Prentiss and his life were "the best in the whole world".
According to Linday Knowledges, Prentiss worked at home manually online. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knows told me that Prentiss, who had a girlfriend named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"he always tried to help people," Knowles said.
He told his family somewhere about the Monday to tell me, "I'm not going to go to jail."
When the police reached the U.S. Highway 1 near Superville at the same time, Lamb stopped his car right down the side, left it there and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Mel argued about educational science in Delta State in the spring of 2015, reports the CV from the University website.
The stars that went away with their charms.
A player (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been rough in recent years.
In 2001, he was ill with leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to the rumors, he has also been a drug addict and was arrested for possession of drugs in 2008.
All of this really requires a tax.
Continued Luke Shaw is on the way for months because of the flood.
Luke Shaw was struck to the right foot of the United States when he lost PSV Eindhoven to the Masters League match.
Although the defender stayed with him and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that he will make it to the end of this period.
Vamman okto Héctor Moreno's carefree guarantee in 15 minutes after she had landed in PSV territory in 20 years of age.
He was treated at the field for 9 minutes, and we were forced to give him oxygen before taking him.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a hemlock on his leg, and he's gone now."
He'll be back in the morning or maybe a day after, then we'll cut him out.
This is terrible, man comes to the United States at 18 years of age, suffers from trouble and then plays great, and now this is what happens.
While I was in the dressing room, he was wearing a oxygen mask on top of him.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but the carnage takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the field.
I'm sure he'll be able to make it this season.
Moreno seems to be upset when he got a red card or a police report.
Judge Nicola Rizzol did not punish a Mexican player.
Gaal suggested that the Italian operator was mistaken.
You can self-recognize the situation when you say that it became a sentence and a red card.
It was a really bad two-legged backdrop.
Play it as follows: "Please, for all your messages, the words don't matter how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I'll come back stronger."
Subject: hours before the death of Mr. Ruin in the case of Mr. Shaw and then leaves the PSV.
The English defenseman has an additional incentive to recover from the next European championship in Denmark.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu says, "It's really bad."
If a player gets out because of this injury, everyone is very sad.
Our players are never meant to hurt the opponent.
Moreon’s head was broken when he played in the Mexican team against Van Gaal’s Dutch at the 2014 World Championships.
"Moreno takes this seriously, because it's not meant to hurt the opponent, and hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I don't see it coming.
The only thing that I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] was going through it, but I didn't see Luke's takla.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know what it means, I know how this kind of thing can be.
I feel so sorry for this."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after he was challenged by Mr. Pas Template.
Does Kai David Cameron know Lorax better than that?
soon learns one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't take long until it learns how to walk.
Unless, then, you're a vamp Cameron.
When the holiday care service asked him for his favorite book, he read Dr. Seuss's The Lorax, the environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was simple, Cameron writes in SuperCamps web site an email which is published on the web site and continues: "Hauska, moving, creative and contains a complete message. I will always be able to view this book when I am out of my reach, because it always seems to be an image or message that we have not seen before."
All this is true, but the next paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book is a summary of the 2012 biblical version, where new characters and details had been created to complete the last original text.
"In the interior of the Nebula, where all nature is lost and even the air is a commodity, Ted's son wants to win his dreams to the boy's side by filling in the hope of seeing the right tree," says Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, right named Theodor Seuss Geisel, did not write.
If this is not enough doubt, then the text of Cameron might be as if it had been made available on the Internet Movie Database web page of the Lorax film's plot summary, which says, "There is still a need in a country where everything is made up and even the air is a commodity, Ted wants to win his dreams on the side of the Audrey girl."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems likely that he would have been such a well-known author of the book. That young, nameless boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by greedful, greedy and needy Kutova Kerskanen, regardless of the idea of giving a brief, blue Lorax, which is "to speak for trees".
The relative invisible PR mission is actually external to an assistant, who has obviously never read the book 20 times a day to the child.
The Prime Minister's informant said that the text must have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps found that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on the current situation at present.
Adam Lyth was certainly in danger of getting away from the team, but it was a place.
Playing against Pakistan in Arabi crime is a tough task, but when you see what team England has chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that the last 3-0, or so, could happen.
I wouldn't shut down the guest house either.
Alastair Cook's side can be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it involves good cyclists and the team's way of deciding is to: they don't have a lottery 2012; they only have a high-quality idea.
Moeen Ali develops in a seismic way and Adil Rashid is an emergency option, even though there is no unknown factor at this point.
Subject: Adam Lyth fell out of a group of crickets, he's about to become Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lycy on the team is, understandably, an easy one for me, because I am his head coach in New York.
The seven games have been good against the adversaries in challenging circumstances, and the simple but rough truth is that the gamers are judged on the basis of their understanding.
There was no doubt about the choice of Joe Root before the fact that, as I've known before, players are the best decision-makers.
About a hundred points more, and the Lyth season in the team would continue, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
If he gets more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
Headmaster Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even if he did not do as well as he could, and it does not appeal to me.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the hitter will be able to copy.
Lyth was elected seven times as a national team, such as Sam Robson's former, while Nick Compton was elected nine times as a national team.
Only Compton got a chance to play both in the house and in the guest house.
The only problem with the complaint is that in the United States, Jonathan Trott was first discovered when Lyth was in high condition, but the lost chance is now the past.
Alex Hales comes along, and there's a hit.
He's got the game of cross-breeding that we in Yorks saw earlier this month when he hit us in Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the rest of his family, but this, of course, depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
There is an idea of Moeen in the decision-making facility next to Cook, so we can have an extra pass but we can reach four fast, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why a hit can't be found there, and this left man has already proved himself a pretty badass player.
Moe may not have done his job in his county in Worcestershire, but he's a three, and it doesn't make much difference.
My old team, Justin Langer, played the first 38 games to the first slow down before he moved on to the opening in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zapar Ansari will be on the team as a backup feeder, and, with a little bit of what I've been doing with him, he seems to be a very young man.
Who can look at his wonderful statistics - with an average of 31, a ball of 35 - and think it's a game, but there's not too many pitchers and the changers are killing young people.
Learned a lot on this tour.
The team outside England seems to have a lot more to do for the coach.
The appointment of Sri Lankan killer Mül Jayawardene as a consultant for games may prove to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest friends in the game, and he brings with him a huge amount of experience, because everything is in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
I'm sorry, but I don't know. I'm sorry.
I always thought that he was born to be part of an international game, be it playing or coaching, and he has the same awesome as Mälma.
Open sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team cell from Durham, Ben Stokes, is rested on a day-to-day basis, Sweden has been given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Not everyone agrees, coachers and alternatives do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember that just like players, their job is done.
Decisions are never taken on a common basis.
United Kingdom's departure from the EU (Brext) can win, the economy is in trouble in 2017.
David Cameron's indirect renegotiation strategies for keeping Britain in the EU is still facing the greatest problems of the day, or would not even take into account the heartfelt "Is that it or not?" of Corbin's election to the leadership of the working party or the organisation of trade unions to be angry with Europe on Tuesday?
Foreigners also have their own Corby and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomatic authority recently explained that, because the EU is in so many different situations, not all of which are for its own good, some Member States have come to the UK's own self-centred agenda, which is almost the resultant concessions and disruptive contractual changes, which these countries do not largely want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Centre for Trade Unions decided that it would not want them either if they were to undermine social protection.
I'll call it Dave and George's self-evident.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance will discuss summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of the obviously famous local monument, whether with or without the local public, and then come again to say that they will be able to support reforms.
Everything is about me.
My European friend, who wants to see the outside of the EU - "Don't talk to us alone with the United States," from Berlin, says he proposes that the shortest ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they won't leave us.
German and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in existence for 10 years and wants to do his job before it goes away the same way that he did for the late Totwal (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland will have a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He too is a powerful force.
The field may soon have a dissenting right-wing government, yet left-wing.
It is hard to see these countries sacrifice themselves for self-fibers, when their energy would rather be in favour of preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to be the same because of their own separatist attacks.
So, my friend, some of these ministers may be able to plan consciously to make no comments in the way of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 British referendum in order to begin the Brexit process.
"Renewing had been organized" and "Rerenewing had nothing to do with Britain."
The Europeans have been given a hard test of how greedy Fleet Street's newspaper can be and how European-sceptic the only powers are, which they were not at the time of the year's referendum inspired by Tony Benn, when our membership began in 1971 was defeated in the first century of year 2:1.
They can be amazed to remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist who worked on writing "EU Direct Bananas" in Brussels as a correspondent in the early 90s.
Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knows who his enemies were.
They included a large number of strangers who pay taxes, bad hackers from abroad and people who have their place of residence, who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair, in fact, is right, but realized that if you're in a cage with a coyote gorilla, you have to give up bananas because of the amazement, if you don't want to be on a gorge's lunch date and then still have dinner.
As a matter of fact, Miliband was more like Blair than itself, as regards the renegotiation of Cameron's renegotiation trick. Bair had agreed to the principle behind the abandoned EU constitution, which was rejected by the Polish and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving the Blairs an exit.
They never let go of again.
The nice Jeremy Corby, who killed me perfectly back at the Westminster National House on Monday (of course I don't have time to spend anymore) seems to be in danger of re-creating Neil Kinnock's 80s boycotted the Murdochi strategy, which was a mistake both here and now.
Even if it may take time, however, he must develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. I do not think so, but undoubtedly Andrew Marri, whose BBC leader Corby had gone off.
The role of Corbyn in the world is, in effect, developing.
He says that we want to remain in a renewed EU.
Well, most of the people in the United Kingdom's independence of Ukip's nationalist and conservativeist spirit will certainly be able to stand up for this.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fan" Benn said both on the internet and on TV this evening, when his internal patrol would have wanted to mean that Corbyn's appointment of a kurski John McDonnell as the finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father was on TV, trying to be dissatisfied with the work force against his government colleagues, without going so far as to go to his place of residence.
Hilary's struggles were more attractive.
But the fight to be involved in "anywhere" - benn's statement - was not what mcdonnell said, and everything Corby said to the heads and members of the public at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever is the unhiercous, general and personal picture Corby wants to convey (remember that I even touch), the discipline of communication is important for the time of the 24-hour TV, and especially for the social media, which is a good basis for growth for the paranoid and the veracity.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to allow Cameron to fly a free ticket to Europe by allowing him to keep the support of the Labour Force in the referendum clear.
Simon too, at least think like that.
But the basic cycle of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spirited economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult conversation between left-wing thinkers, for whom the gut of some differences is the most important dogmic in the practical discussions.
When it comes to his dual division with NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby's campaign is not going to be handed over), foreign law diploms will just have to try to explain it to one of them.
Why do you think it would be worth a lot of money (they too have suspicious voters) to grant to the United Kingdom when it can be all right?
The United States has already been somewhat disappointed at the weak overall performance of British firms in Egypt, Libya and Syria, even in the presence of a conservatory government that is cutting costs, as I was reminded at the start of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts’ criticisms of the .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The authorities have stated that the state-funded agency’s claim that electronic tobacco is 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco was the result of a meeting of 12 people, some of whom had been involved in the tobacco industry.
Experts who wrote to the British Medical Journal (BMJ) brought together with Lance the evidence provided by the critics of Public Health England (PHE) in their report on electric cigarettes.
PHE published this "virstunpylväs" report last month, describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, a number of researchers have doubted the sustainability of the data and referred to the links between some people and the consumer.
Last month, Lancet published a paper on medical journalism, in which the main decision of PHE was attacked against the "extraordinary hovel base".
Other researchers in the BMJ have wondered whether the arguments were "infested for purpose or for sand."
The Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Martin McKee, as well as Simon Capewell, Professor of Medical Epidemiology at the University of Helsinki, says: "The main principle of public health is that the means of action must provide evidence of effectiveness."
They say that they expect the public to expect that PHE's claim that "at the current best estimate, electricity tobacco is about 95 % less harmful than conventional tobacco" is based on a detailed assessment and analysis of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one of the 12 meetings in which a multi-disciplinary analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize the disadvantages of themselves, which are combined with various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in a study.
Mckee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Sophie, which is reported to have received funding from the British American Tobacco for research.
It also supports BAT's public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported having received funding from the electricity tobacco manufacturer, but not from the funding that he reportedly received from the former Philip Morris International, they are increasing.
The criteria for the panel members are not explained, but the panel includes a number of specific supporters for electrical tobacco, some of which also reported that they had received funding in the field of research.
Where they were present, they are not familiar with their expertise in tobacco control.
The Director-General of PHE also attended the meeting.
Many researches "explicitly acknowledge" that there is a lack of "controversial evidence on the disadvantages of most products and most criteria", McKee and Capewell.
None of these connections or limitations are included in the PHE report.
Mckee and Capewell are talking about PHE's claims that "the second is no evidence that the gas tobacco is working on a route of late or non-smokers".
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Well-being of PHE, says that BMJ's arguments have been answered in the past.
He says, "Tips are much less handy than knocking."
Half the people who have spent their lives die of addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electrical tobacco are relatively small, but we need to continue to study for a long period of time.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much uncertainty about relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80 000 people die every day of a smoking disease related to smoking and pay NHS 2 billion pounds every year.
By explaining the current evidence - i.e. even if e-cigarettes are not harmless, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the sharks of conventional tobacco - our responsibility.
BBC would be in favour of abandoning EastEnders, says former Channel 4 CEO.
Former Channel 4 Chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should complete programmes such as sending EastEnders or The Voice, and that some competitors would "give anything" from a series of hits such as this one on the Albert Square street.
Johnson said that the licences should only be used for the purpose of carrying out programmes that are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting in place public service programmes likely to have a public audience, in difficult postings, one of the most viewed by competitors against and on competitions such as BBC4.
After Mr. Tony Hall of the BBC said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, John Word said that he had been working with Channel 4 for six years at a time, for a relationship with BBC, for a reason.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programmes that clearly agreed upon for unsubsidised clients," Johnson told the Room Communications Committee as part of its study of the future of BBC.
If the licence is maintained - I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or, in the long term, for this - it should restrict its production to programmes that are not carried out and produced by others.
The Forcea will be sent to the main transmission time, as it will be with the greatest possible support for its future.
The idea that no one else would look like a program is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's just stupid.
Mr John said: 'I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes which could also be financed.
The Voice is one and EastEnders is the other, without a doubt inside the house.
Honestly, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand what it is about public service broadcasting.
I don't think that would weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4 in the 2004-2010 period, was launched by Sgt. Johnson, who said that BBC is responsible for the hunting of the viewer "for the goals of people working there, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support."
He commented on the BBC's most popular series, recalling the comments made by Tony Ball, former director of Sky. He gave his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 in Edinburgh in order to ensure that BBC sells both books and EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programmes " go to BBC4, where there is often no way to measure the view, but BBC is therefore in a position to fulfil its responsibilities and then can make 4 billion pounds of promise revenue in a way that is merely to say, 'of course, we do all these unknown programs, which no one is looking at'".
They put them in a embassy where no one will ever see them.
Concerning the promise, Johnson said to the Committee: "I will ask you to find a more regressive system in the matter, who will get the most out of it.
Of course you're all thinking, we're all thinking that 150 pounds a year gets a lot of money, but I don't know if it's right for people who have 150 pounds of money because they don't use BBC much.
The former Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also witnessed to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its former task of "knowledge, education and entertainment".
He said that only a small part of the BBC's is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% TV and 0.1% radio - and that it should play on Australian and Canadian broadcasts and change the task into "information, education and entertainment".
with regard to the partnership issues, Elstein said that BBC should focus more on the events of the Proms concerts, which, according to him, are only shown in full, and that it is with commercial people that all of this should be viewed as being relevant.
The "sound genetics" enables the brain cell to be controlled by sound waves.
The video shows how the main lams change the direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
The investigators have gone beyond those who have genetically modified systems to control them by means of a sound wave discharge.
The small diaphragms change the direction as soon as they hit the sound pulse, which is too high for the human ear to hear.
Impulses function by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells that have a radial-wave-to-wave membrane.
Subject: Researchers are able to read and write mental activity in light.
Researchers said that worms indicate the performance of a new method called voice genetics, which can be used to activate the brain, heart and cells from outside the body.
Researcher Sreekanth Calasani of the Salk Institute in Lään La Jolla told The Guardian that one day the method could reverse the brain recovery. It is an invasive measure in which the brain is driven by electrical pulses to treat Parkinson’s disease.
The shell worms do not usually respond to the reverse, but Calasani found that when they were made up of liquid with microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He knew that the bubbles would form the lightning waves that would then flow into the worms.
Intensifiers have an effect on the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures that are contained in the cell cells of some worms.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells attached to them, reports the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to prepare for the ultra-controllable diaphragm, Calasan genetically engineered the worms so that part of their business nerve cells are TRP channels.
Calasani turned on the modified worms, the microscopes reinforced the sound waves and transmitted them to the worms where they switched on the modified business nerve cells.
There are some features in the process that match optogenics, a professional tool that allows scientists to turn on and off cells using light pulses.
Chalasani, however, says that the use of sonogenetics may have some advantages over optetics.
It's like the light that has to be sent from the optic to the desired fibre within the brain, the lumbaric sound waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be put into the brain from the skull.
"We believe that it can be possible, by means of the use of the medicine and the therapeutic role, to have the cells of the person being targeted immediately to detect an echo signal in a very good environment for certain neurological treatments," Calasan said.
Other applications may focus on cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

A separate campaign also led to bus stops and metro trains being released by many posters, which require a closer look at.
"Serious information, Traveling on DLR route from 15 to 18 September?" is asked, together, by using the third sub-country font and the brand, as the DLR track turns into the image of the tank.
Here in September, a pack of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... to help customers to stop alternative trade fairs.
These 300 posters are the works of artists who were presented at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs (in the process of making public appearances).
A collection called Special Patrol Company is using "Ad Space Hack Packs" to spread posters around London. It's a six-pound package of six keys, according to which "to access a third part of the space of the entire planet's bus stops".
Transport for Europe is not interested in this illegal "promotion of the public".
One of the parodia advertisements generated by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to the Cruel Designs Curriculum and the University of Essex Journal, Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly asking for more and more and more jobs and they want to export political work to third-party audiences.
The artists have started working with the activists on resistance fronts when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their art to affect society.

Annesty's video has been viewed via the 29th through the last 24 hours more than 100,000 times. It was created by a free advertising agency VCCP, as well as a illustrator and a screen saver working for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever discovered that the replacement show was not advertised at all - and even ExCeL was always there at the time - and he said, "Let's get rid of the campaign they're trying to try."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic advertising of spidery corporateism, but "it is more important to highlight things with bright colors and animation".
"They have done a fantastic job helping us to ask questions about the illegal torture equipment that is being sold at the fair," says Amnestytyn Tom Davies.
The United States now needs to take action and ensure that the means of torture are not illegally located in our own home.
Probably the most creative art in the arms trade will come from within ExCeL, when the designers trade fantasticly solid products.
It will be revealed in the press release that it has received an order from the United States of America 'from AT4CS RS from the top'.
It reads as "the only kind of pipe fight that targets the excellent effects of the armor on the object inside".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight-eight-eight-eight children living in a student apartment.
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student home at the age of 19, which is when I believed in barettes and moral relativism, but it's only now that I remember the violent voices of the people I admire - and the many, long complaints that I remember.
Part of what I've learned can be divided into eight simple pieces.
Moving to a home can be anything that's not going to happen to be completely scary.
It is tempting to talk about where you come from, to keep a breaker and where you think about Corbyn, and to say, "I really don't want to or to see Marmite, for real, it's just for real it's just a sneaky way to find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And help others to ask questions and interest.
It will discuss and help the people you like and not the people you would not like to talk about with the fire and they will share the extinguishers.
Give me some space.
People's rooms often turn into cocktail parties, movie parties and public entertainment, but they are also places where people make and repair their underwear.
Subject: Don’t even think about starting a relationship
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments consist of a room to another culture of walking, which is friendly, quality and creates life-long problems.
It can mean a lot to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture will allow you to say "I love you and want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now that I can get back to the way I spent talking to you".
Try to sense when a student has become tired of socializing and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Speaking of knocking on the door, knocking on the door.
One of my students at my apartment was of the opinion that if the door was not locked, he had been invited in.
I saw some real stuff.
Beware of the use of lynching.
Since you're starting to bake in the middle of the month, people's nights knocking on a chocolate table and making themselves seem somewhat less strange, less " Welcome to the neighborhood, I'll do something for you, now I ask you personal questions" in the '50s.
The offer of self-made loops is a very good way to get killed.
Your people will try to talk to you, and it may be that in the future they will join you in a masculine surprise.
Of course, of course, you know how to make bread.
The artificially mixed flour-sugar-super fat-suppressants are likely to just pretend to be asleep while you're knocking.
Stealing food is common in student housing.
Obviously, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you just take the milk for your tea?
Check the milk and check it out.
It is essential that they give you permission, wherever they boil inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to look more like my apartment, which mixed it with a lot of pressure to punish those who stole it.
He's in bed right now.
You don't get to talk so people can't get into bed or study.
You're not just being a decent person, but because you're like that translation pot in the middle of nowhere.
I was wondering if they could play the drum and bass music at three o'clock and he had a exam.
The answer was to increase the volume of the voice.
Finally, when they shut up at five o'clock, the girl kindly let me sleep for two hours before she put her own music in a bang, locked her door and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your coming mate happened to be moving to the same place with you?
In other words, wouldn't it be incredible to be tempted if you thought that you were a roommate as your mate, you'd be held together, you'd be different, and then you'd see him every day and you'd probably lose all your friends with him.
Of course you want what you want, but if a hot apartment isn't really your future, you could at least try and talk to the bottom of the story.
At the moment you find that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between toying and bullying is less than it seems.
A good trick is fun, but it's only temporary.
You can give us a useful and fun education to prevent by hiding something but never mess up a room with a toothpaste and a shampool.
Lock their doors and drop the keys to the glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer, but do not attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling as if at most the method is correct.
Racist attack on a foreign student's residence in Kite - The reception centre planned to host the house was built in Salo.
A racist attack at Kite in North Karelia took place at the residence of foreign students last night.
On the contrary, this is not about detention facilities for minors, but about the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have already been in Finland, Kiten evangelical professor Heidi Luukainen says.
The windows and walls of the asylum facilities of the university were built with racist signs, such as the Hakarists, and a metal object was thrown through one of the accommodation windows, says East Finland.
According to Lukäinen, a youth education teacher in the university, who was under the authority of the state, there were about ten people in the building under the authority of an evil influence.
"Being and adults, people are free to move, so some may be elsewhere," says Lukkainen.
The university has accommodation in people from 12 different languages.
They have already been a recent student in Finland and newly arrived underage asylum seekers.
There are a-states for people who are in a mess-up building.
Some of them study in basic education, some of them are in public studies and some of them study in Finnish," says Lukkainen.
A status is a so-called second residence permit which can be granted four times to a foreigner who has already been present in Finland.
Eastern Finland is investigating an attack as an injury and a domestic violation.
According to Mrs. Lukka, an event was held on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's nothing in here, and nobody's leaving.
We have been studying abroad for the second time year, and this is the first time that something like this happens," says the Numerous.
According to Lukukukla, the mess has gone from the wall to the wall.
At least three men are suspected of being the authors and they were moving in a light passenger car.
I think this is the night's night's head, when this subject has now been on the table.
Nothing more serious," says Lukkainen.
Salo has also been founded in a hospital designed for the reception centre.
This happened the last time.
He told me about it on his MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital was marked by a brancher and written in English by "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
5 p.m. at 1.02 p.m., corrected for incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the house.
State resides in the Y-train to the Karelia - the passengers are not in the mood, "from an idiotic state".
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja will cease to die in March.
The news pissed off passengers entering the start of a flight at the main train station in Helsinki.
In particular, the downfall strikes the Siunti, said Torbjörn Bengtström, the municipality of Torbjörn.
It's an idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and working fast and I'm in touch with Helsinki.
This can be nothing more than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström says with the HTV interview notice that he'll be coming by tractor to the capital.
There are also fire changes in the rest of the U.S.A.
The H- and R-trains on the main runway shall be connected to a new R-line.
The station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula remain out of operation.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase transport for the following period of the contract.
The day changes over the year and the routes to be closed are all over the country.
The next four-year agreement in autumn was adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Sijun Bengtström believes that the State transiter is an unlikely activity.
Every single error that has been made and repeated in a very systematic manner.
There'll be a penance.
Y-trains are also used by others other than raaseporians and guerrillas, because it is the best and bypasses multiple stations.
In Spain, Annina Laury was at home with the fate of those who travel the most to the city.
"It is a pity to those who re-enter their global journey," he says in pain on the Y-train.
The simplification of the home is permitted.
There must be a new station on the coastline that will replace the Y-train in the region of Helsinki Region Transport (HL), i.e. export to the church.
This will lead to more costs for HSL, in fact, for local authorities and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to examine the different options and their impact on service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi.
Costs are still impossible to assess accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of points, HSL has paid for the Y-train for about a decade, of course, the Ministry has much more than that.
On the main track, the R-line is between two positions.
On the other hand, the number of tours in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
The whole country will have a total of 28 small locations and numerous routes.
The Ministry no longer buys bulk transport on the route from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyvälä-Haapamaki-Seinajoki.
Piksämäki-Joensy route to the shortest route to Piksämäki-Varkas.
Trains on the routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million miles per year, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The agreement is intended to provide the State with 12.3. annual savings.
The value of this value is approximately 2 million per year.
Sixten Korkman in the chapter of Capital Date: "Max needs to get to know you".
The crises in the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work in 1867-1894 on Capital, in the book Marx's Time of Capital, published today by Yrjö Hakanen, the first President of the Council of Europe.
"This is more serious than a long time ago," Hakanen wrote in his first speech.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and invading have proved to be extremely far-reaching in most areas of life, concentration of capital, and the growing role of money and imaginary capital.
The book list of books based on the Capital Seminars that started to be organized also includes the Professor of the University of Aalto, the prestigious economist, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's present present "now and forever".
But the former Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Economics and the Delegation of the Department of Economics is not a Marx, is he?
That's it.
Korkman on the phone says that he does not consider Marx to be a modern economicist, but rather as an interesting social thinker.
Today, social affairs are different and different, but Marx was a philosopher, a historian, a sociologist, an economist, a journalist, an agitator and a literary translator.
"General idea is that the aaartistry speaks of the wrong opinions of the dead," Korkman begins.
True, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
In fact, Marx understood the nature and meaning of the British Revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of the capitalism, Korkman's mind.
However, the egman sees the value of Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked some questions," he says.
We are now discussing Marx's interests again, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who understand the big picture, as a result of the technical upheaval, to change the world", Korkman does.
Well, what we're supposed to decide is not going to help Marx.
I think that, as far as I'm concerned, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Marx supports Korkman's experience.
"In the '70s, Marxa couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The peasants and the Trotskys and other sects hated all understandings, but even more so."
Today, the debate is more frequent, and Marxa can also approach the ideology of the years back without any pressure.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's mind - as in other classes," says Korkman.
Forced on a criminal in Sri Lanka for a criminal offence.
Calls for a special court to be set up to investigate the national crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 occurred on Wednesday after a delay.
The report is responsible for national crimes both by the Sri Lankan armed forces and by the rebels known as Tamils.
At least 100,000 people have been killed in the Srila Civil War.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims either.
In particular, in the last six months of 2009, a major attack by the armed forces should be announced, as required in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report charges torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims of as much as women.
According to the report, men and women have been involved in fighting side-by-side and child-to-side violence.
Both parties have committed murders according to the report.
Sri Lanka again on Wednesday that it will organise the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In the Thanh-Test, there was a tantrum of social media.
On Wednesday night, the syllabus of autumn had a long foreign language, which most of them had English.
More than 16,000 people have their own skills tested.
In the experiment, it was written about the matter as a matter of media.
On their own grounds, they should be thinking about the work of the social community and about being alone and working together.
In English, 150-250 was written to the administrator of the web site.
The Monday was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the resting chair of Finnish Leelia.
He came to me for advice on how to do things, too.
All the subjects were four of which one had to be selected.
"That was the hardest of them", considers the third topic of Porvoo's English English lecturer Mia Lybeck.
At this point, there was only a link from another President of the European Commission, Jose Barroso.
The point was that Lybeck had a nice time.
There was a conversation about why young people should be hired to work for young people.
"At least in our work, we have been trained to write speeches," says Lybeck, and evaluates the whole test "to make it easy".
In fact - or more often - some of the English experiments were responsible for some of the texts that, for example, included the adaptation of the summer horticulture to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, there was also some long Russian (1st student), German (124), Polish (5) and Japanese (27).
The articles of the autumn are repeated on a frequent basis, in which the second domestic living or Finnish experiment is in turn.
The upper secondary schools are usually tested, i.e. the expression of employees does not affect it.
The University of Applied Sciences Board invites the pilots to search for appropriate contacts in time to get them to the trial.
if the delay was not due to your own negligence, you may be able to receive a period of time.
In the apples, a trade was made with a gun at risk.
In Ou, Wednesday morning, a trade was held in the city of the clock.
According to him, the shooter had gone into dark things and face-to-face a cover-up commandopo.
The man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to everyone, the man had attacked the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated by an ugly listener.
There are tens of thousands of protesters who are forced to come to Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland.
The manifestation against the government's replications will be blocked in the middle of the day, declare it.
Up to tens of thousands of people may arrive on the spot as soon as possible.
The members of the SAK, Aava and the STK alliances will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
I also believe that there is an inclusive spirit of mind.
On the other hand, the police at work are not only to deal with alerts and other police activities, but also to ensure that the mental manifestation is resolved.
Roads to the railway station are known from motor vehicles for the period between 9.30 and 14 a.m.
All we need to do is call in the area the alarms.
The traffic from the direction of Hakaniemi will be transferred to the Kaisaniemi traffic area, from the west to the mainland coast.
Is it enough for the police department to have people, Captain Seppi Kujala?
For the time being, it seems to me that that is enough.
I do not support the work-related issues of the police.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming from other parts of the world for the sake of their sense of mind.
There's no telling what the exact code is.
"Some of them are coming, but most of all we're going to go on our own," Kujala says.
We urge you to require private car rides in the morning of Helsinki.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic connection extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the core.
There's a lot of traffic going on between noon and the beginning of the day.
There are also many subscription buses coming from Finland with the help of protesters from elsewhere.
They will not let the Railway Entrepreneurial.
The busses are going to be a long way from here.
The journey will then have to walk to the location of the protest," says Kujala.
The demonstration also stops Helsinki's public transport.
From the point of view, there is also a positive side here.
The problem of mass transport, which is usually on hand at these big meetings, will now be dealt with as a matter of course.
The protesters have informed the police that tens of thousands of general economic policy opponents may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mood to feel calm.
There are few ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finnish people are rational and peaceful," Kujala knows.
In many parts of Finland, Finland is also accompanied by local manifestations.
Friday's expression is in many ways an ordinary - do you remember these strikes and expressions?
One of the major protests organised by trade unions is in many ways interesting and informal.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä, emeritus Martti Siiseinen.
As a matter of fact, it is no wonder that ay-move protests.
If that's not the case, it would raise its hands in front of the government, said Sisinen.
The real estate government has introduced Finnish corporateism into the fundamentals of tradition - as well as those that are important for the development of the Finnish state of affairs.
The government's strong record is missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features in this, that ay-move is really going to get down on their knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the ay movement is not supported by all employees in some protests.
The novelty is now the sharp division that is created by the demonstration of the part that the ay-move would like to participate in the demonstration.
Throughout Finland, unemployed people who were gathered in Finland showed their senses in the Parliamentary House in August 1993.
If one of the statements is looking for a comparison, it could be the main impression of the unemployed, Mururstai, held in 1993, Siisinen says.
In the middle of the deepest depression, the Muruturstai collected 20,000 unemployed together.
Esko Aho (medium) was collapsing from one labour market to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and the trade unions was never as bad as in Aho's courtship.
The relationship between the state and the ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murjorstin.
Now there's no such thing as a police government, it says.
In this way, it is still interesting to see that it is so close to the right in spite of the basic Finns' speeches.
The elements of the new labour movement were the elements of the old labour movement at the time of the fresh start.
A number of new protesters are expected to be present.
Mind-telling also stops public transport and possibly covers days and schools.
Even if the protest does not receive undivided support from employees, it may become a matter of years.
In Helsinki, there have been about 300 distributions per year in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, the protests of the Finnish movement have been very calm - even though the methods of action have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids the loop, is illegal.
Thoughtmakers try to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sisian.
At the end of the 1990s, however, new winds came into existence.
The mind culture changed.
EU membership got farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police got ready to get their pig shit on.
The salary of the Presidents lasted three months in 1998 for a period of three months.
There were also visible strikers and pilots, among other things.
What are these strikes and demonstrations?
In the 1970s, metal and electricity houses.
The most important houses in the 1970s were metal strike in 1919 and power and power strike in 1977.
70,000 metalmen participated in the home of the mechanics.
The strike was concluded on the basis of a meeting of the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
The mechanics received a 16% raise in wages.
In spring 1977 the home strike lasted 49 days and broke down all over the country.
The break-in occurred in March of the year.
On 4 November 1999, some 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met with a view to supporting the work of the House of Parliament.
In 1998, three months of the firefighters were strikers in 1998.
The strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, except the longest in the world.
The farmer opposes the EU in 1994 and 1999.
In 1994, when farmers protested against the EU, they came into egg rain.
"Sibera teaches, the EU says," said one of the slogans.
The farmers were able to catch snow by the way of the day.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and banishment in front of the meeting site.
Nurses were strikers in 19th and 1995.
In that month, nurses gave up during the month.
The first time they were in existence was in 19 January.
A number of deaths occurred during the strike during the strike in 1995.
He threatened to do so in the years 2007 and 2007 and the number of managers in the field.
The threat of incarnation led to the conclusion of negotiations.
The officials strike in 2001.
"Doctors on the lattice - forced," read the slogan of the strike by the strike physicians who were on the lattice.
It took five months for municipal health centre and hospital doctors to complete a lively discussion on how to endanger public security.
After the strike, the general government raised the doctor's wages.
Workers moving in 2013
About 5,000 marches for study in Helsinki from the Secretary-General to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The central police are investigating the backgrounds of the Finnish lorry on refugees to find out what is going on.
police have been asked by the central crime police to assist in the management of backgrounds on a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the police stopped a truck near the German border in the Afghanistan, with 42 refugees on board.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
You were all right when you were on the cold truck. You were all right.
We've had an exchange of information with the police.
Investigation and main responsibility are at the scene of the incident in Austria, reports Central Criminal Police Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, the number of refugees travelling by truck in Austria increased by more fatally at the end of the journey.
At that point, all 71 people on board were apparently suffocated by suffocation.
According to the first-in-command Radio on cooperation with the police, the truck belongs to a Finnish stock company.
Among other things, it is a foreign-based man, about 40 years old, who is responsible for the activities of the restaurant and its management.
In the Republic of Austria, two Iraqi societies have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
The Captain who beats the refugees, but a former trafficker and a clever businessman - the story of the five smugglers - the story of the five smugglers.
The king of up-to-date smugglers, the violent boat driver, the elegant missionary and the good-bye taxi driver.
For example, people live in the European Union because of the smuggling of human beings.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and invited dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency will be meeting in Finnish this time.
In the course of the book, they are working on the smuggling of human beings, making proposals for decisions and targeting smugglers from different roads.
hs five of us.
I'm just gonna get rid of myself.
Kerkenna Islands The eastern coast of Tunisia is not attracted to foreign tourists, but many Tutian people are heading for summer hunting there.
On behalf of their islands, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, since the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the vicinity of El Attaya, there is Emir, a chained catcher and the father of four children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more productive to deliver people.
Emir has done it on a ten-metre wooden rod hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it will cost 40 people.
One trip Emir makes after spending about 8 000 euros.
Emi has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Things arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring period, the vast number of people wanted to escape from restlessness.
Then the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis reappeared.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerknna island in small groups.
Emi will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as it takes to see them.
What we're saying is that the client just and just survives.
Accommodation costs about 75 bucks a night, and if the customer runs out of money in the meantime, that's their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night and lay low.
Let's drive off the island, then let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let'
Sometimes the sea is heavy, and in waves 20 metres high, passengers cry and throw up.
At the end of the human cargo has been released in half an hour and Eman has returned.
She doesn't want to be afraid of her.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
In this book, he tells us that once the police saw him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and let them swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers from one neck and threw them over the top," Emir says in the book.
General passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
In his country, he is said to have to condemn this from here.
I'm just gonna go ahead and think about it.
They need to be shown immediately, here's the order.
A regular taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bočšaša, Finland.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine's been pulling on him lately, and anyway, it's seen the best in the day.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all and that it moves towards the border with Hungary.
Boča is a small village of a native about 60 km from Belgrade to lunch.
The village is located next to the center for asylum seekers, where the main places to stay are located.
In the central forests of the world, men without their families are staying in tents, lakes and abandoned cars, which they have now succeeded in finding or creating.
Also living in the forest are those who have not lodged an asylum application in Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private homes, but it's a secret.
Goran of the forest group finds most of his customers.
These are often the end of the exhausted - through the Balkans - the route requires a large number of crossings and day trips in the outbacks, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
In the near future, in the Bočša region, in the hub of large smuggling of human beings, people are very tired of dying.
Goran's guests are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurdishs.
The best customers are Syrians, he explains in the book.
"They say the right thing and that's it," Goran cheers.
According to him, the Africans are trying to make noises.
Goran doesn't.
A fool's hand all over the place.
First of all, let's agree on an example of 300 euros, then they'll lower it to 200 and now offer it to 150.
Goran emphasizes being a nice and good-hearted man.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells his work more than the rest of us and billing for a ride to the country border for only EUR 50 per person.
The distance is about three hundred miles, most of which is just the freeway.
Colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran owes approximately EUR 50,000 per year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite an annual income.
Serbia has determined that taxis should not carry immigrants 12 miles closer to the border with Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcutes and takes his visitors a mile from the border.
Then he points to the right direction at all times, and he's going to vehemently vehemently vehemently vehemently vehemently vehemently vehement
At work of grace, work of grace.
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary, and that is not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Kampala, where there are many believers who have fled the Congo, as well as a center in which children from Congo are helped.
In addition to preaching, the missionary tells us about the smuggling business where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of loving - kindness.
It's important to look good when you're around.
He polishes his shoes several times, and makes sure that the rubber of the white underpants is stunned in style from under the top of the jeans.
The publisher is thrilled by his new Mercedes, his new highway car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and to the world forward.
The customer will first call one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary.
He advises that you should arrive at the border at once, hide the money in a way that you visit and go to the border with traders who cross the border.
In order to obtain asylum seekers or refugee status in Uganda, the authorities need to tell them that they come from, for example, the North Kivi military areas, and that they have been subjected to violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary will arrange a new present for the customer.
The old identity card will be lost and another replaced.
That's where the missionary's contacts with Ugandan police are located.
This will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, at least the United Nations Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The preacher knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
It costs about 100 euros to apply to the Ugandan police, approximately 150 to the humanitarian organisation, and between 4 500 and 7 000 to every European country.
Foliot and ice-cold zones
He's an instigating smuggler, but he's a trafficker.
Four Irish officers are on the French coast of Calais, where their job is to keep people on their way to the United Kingdom.
He's got an Afghan, a Russian taxi driver and a bunch of truck drivers in London who don't really know who they are.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais center.
They drive the A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go to prison for the organisation of immigration.
Of course he doesn't. He's already been sitting there for drugs.
The taxi will decide, Tom runs over the motors of his customers to a resting place where the drivers sleep before they cross the canal to the British.
Tome's choice of the right truck - is to make sure that it's working just now, not just in the Netherlands, but also in the Netherlands - and play it across the safety guard.
It has to be done quietly so that you don't get out of bed.
One driver is on the run, but then the driver will be more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom is spinning around the foil, the same as the one behind which he wraps around the fryer or the oven potato.
It should prevent the police from detecting a hideout.
Some people have no intention of filling a sleeping bag with a full purpose.
Tom leaves a truck in the truck and leaves the place, hoping that the driver will not drive a car before Britain at least.
The King of the Consignors
Muammer Küzyk is one of the world's most famous smugglers of human beings.
The most up-to-date Turkish law has been called the market leader and the dispute over illegal incursion in the Mediterranean, which manages maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly in Finland and Italy.
Fük has been operating since the 1990s and has constantly developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a single competitive advantage for entrepreneurs: he's still asking for the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury discount: Turkish ports are rented for pleasure, as you wish to take the United States or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are loaded to a full extent by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transporting between 5 000 and 7 000 euros against charges first from Istanbul to one hundred and from there to Europe at sea.
They are kept in human life, for example in the old industrial halls, until these are time to leave.
Going into minibuses and driving somewhere along the coast.
It is worth hiding in the mind of the environment and waiting to see.
When it is given, the ship must be boarded as soon as possible.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The guard can only observe how far the ship is swimming, as no other group of people is present.
Food and drink are given, but the less people out and throw up, the better.
The hotel will receive approximately EUR 53,000 from one luxury ship after expenses.
He does not deal with things in the general sense himself but tends to deal with the heads, the recruiters, the guards, the hosters and other minor factors for his work.
During the summer, transport is provided by at least hundreds of people and the country makes millions of dollars.
He's supposed to have bought coverts across the country, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küyuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party congressman and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
He's probably disappeared since then.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The book of Death Travellers will be published at this time, not next week.
A American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute.
Three times in the Olympics, a 1 500-metre runner Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has been published in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine released copies of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton has decided to make his career at the Summer Olympics in Zimbabwe.
He came to the race in top condition and ran for the best time he could.
In the final, however, he found himself all over the place.
He rushed right at the top and defended his position on the ground with a run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power was lost.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed by him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton, in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton had a two-way mood disorder.
His brother Don had done a year before Sydney's cats were killed, and he himself felt enormous successes.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The church had no economy, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers.
He also went overboard with his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR an hour.
He says he's spent money on luxury life.
The one explanation by Mr Hamilton for becoming prostitutes was also that he longed for the same adrenaline loops as he had received in public sport in general.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a two-way mood disorder.
The life of a former star runner came to light at the end of 2012, when the article was published in the Smoking Gun magazine.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the world's statistics at the time of 3.57.40, but remained for the last time in the Sydney Olympics.
The third world was thrilled when the Union imposed Norwegian skiing rules on it: "Indirectly clear".
The Polish ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of the same line at least one of its members.
The ski union in North and Norway has been working all summer and last year's sportsmanship.
It has offered the University a better deal than other athletes, and it has not been good enough for the multi-world and the Olympics either.
The result of this dispute was the decision of the Norwegian Ski Union to exclude Northug from the world cup of the next world.
The first was to thank the two world astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was afraid that the Federation had made a ski move.
"Thank you for your support," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the universe," he continued.
The dispute between the ski trade and Northug is about money.
Turns out, he's probably part of a whole new country team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was pleased to represent a union that also cares for future generations, and does not allow one athlete to be a soloist.
He also recalled that the Union has given both the economic and the other privileges of the Union over the years.
I know that because I have been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a very different rule than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, the Highut published a personal record in which he assured himself that he wanted to play sports in Norway's colour next year's world Cup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrad Jacobsen won a total of three MMs in his career, two of which are gold.
He was involved in the team that won the relay last winter in Falun.
It is also held in the Nordic countries on a regular basis.
On the 25th of September, there will be a quake of various restaurants and shops that have been issued with a paper-transmitter shield.
The aim of this day is to highlight Finland's high level of food competence and low level of food leaving the restaurant and to raise awareness of the significance of the plate as part of a high quality.
It is worth recalling that not all high-level products are concentrated in the capital region, but all over Finland search for top restaurants that are controlled and classified by an independent operator.
The first focus of the event is a demonstration of the importance of the event as part of enhancing the awareness of thyroid restaurants and the organisation.
In the northern part of the day, Vaasa restaurant will take place at the Foundation and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, Thursday is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events taking place during the same day in different parts of the world.
It will continue to exist as the host country.
Kauboki: Kaubahawa office application to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of a reception centre in Kaubahawa.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre at the offices of the former Kaubava settlement, now owned by LSK In Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent existence in the region of the critical infrastructure of the crisiser, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Association.
The Kaaoki newspaper reports that according to a private person, the investment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interest in the area and airport of the same Airport of the airport, which is also not explained in the study when preparing the reception centre.
It was concluded that, for the last two years, negotiations on the organisation of the field of Kauhava and the outcome of any foreign operator have taken place.
This issue has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Nihiö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
A member of the staff to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition to the reception office, but of the fact that it is planned to be the right place in the former Parliamentary Area.
The Board of Governors of the month-to-day discussed the reception centre next Monday.
Navigation: Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Management means that immigrants and those here have the most important conditions, Niistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting with the presidents of all Parliamentary parties in his office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the P.O., the concern about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He appreciates the fact that governments and opposition parties in Finland are able to work together in an intimate way.
In these times, when we face major challenges, we will face them.
It is clear that the situation in Syria, as well as actions in the region of the United States, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
The system is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a far-reaching direction, namely that the United States and Moldova are able to do so, it will have an impact on Ukraine and the still tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to that, the NATO site was also discussed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation at work.

Researcher: A big risk for a pig is a risk to the brain.
According to the report, communication requires multilingual channels, and the Prime Minister's television and mobile phones are one of the other channels.
In the future, a channel of this kind of speech is needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in Parliament.
It does not yet have to be assessed how often the repeating way of talking about television and mobile phones becomes.
According to the audience, speech is not always broadcast through the Yle channel in the future.
If other channels are reported to be a channel, then let's see.
Now we're going to use this channel, Sipilä said.
According to Finland's economic situation, it is so serious that it requires that the television and mobile communications be given to the public.
What we are talking about here is rather complicated and requires a longer explanation.
We ended up in this channel, Sipilä cleared it up.
The speech will be sent from 21.05.201 to 21.20 in both 1 and in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Far away from being able to take the most important risk.
Media Researcher hopes that Sipilä’s mobile phone will not talk more about moving around in general.
The aim of this initiative is to put the right of choice of public debate in the first place and to abstain from public debate on disputes? asked Anu Koivönen, Professor of Stockholm University.
I would like to recall the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin's recent comment that he does not take over the media agenda and that he does not allow it to be defined.
In the name of the democratic debate and of the public, I hope that these matters do not relate to each other.
To understand that commercial media has become angry at Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field did not react.
Political policy-makers' communication is not a matter of knowledge in society.
It is the responsibility of the media to make a definite effort to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken into consideration.
According to Sipilä, the mobile phone is a major risk for Sipilä.
We should talk about bringing something new and important to the table so that the high expectations that we have spoken can be met.
Is there anything else we've heard out there today?
Or is he able to talk differently, in a different way, or was I different or something different?
He says that if there is only more of the same thing in the permit, you should wonder why such a great gesture and Yle gave it the same time.
All in all, in this context, if this is not the case, it is a matter of particular interest to others to talk about the matter as a matter of urgency and as a matter of urgency.
There is a danger that Yle will be stamped in the communication of politicians or the Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in the interest or general interest of Yle.
From back to back, a clever move.
What is also important in the forthcoming talk is what is most important for us not to say, the media researcher stresses.
The evening will look closely at what Sipilä is up to and what it is not, says Jyvälän computer research operator Heikki Kutti.
According to the moon, the television speech is clever from Siloi, so this is how you get to bring your own point of view without sounding.
This message will be made public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
The wing bypasses the media and speaks to the public directly.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong with the talk because they do not ask specific questions.
According to the moon, it is very important how Sipilä plays on TV - the sweat is pouring, shaking hands.
He's like a Sipilian to the real character, which now tells the people what to do.
If you can do the right thing, it can work.
The situation is different from that where you know about something, because it's like you're talking to someone who's actually talking to them.
Waa (United States President Barack) Obama and partners regularly engage in such activities.
Very ordinary.
Policy researcher Erkka Railo considers the main speech to be really an option for the public.
The reason for this is not for decades that the Prime Speaks directly to the people.
A meaningful time is the right way to go," Railo says.
The D.A. believes that the Prime Minister's intention is to make the Finns mindless for the one on the table.
In addition, wage and salary organisations organise protests and strikes against government action.
The President of the Left Alliance, Mr. Paavo Arhinmäki, says that Sipila could speak on the state of the nation in Parliament as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would also bring the talk to light.
President of the S.D. Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces that he will challenge the Sipilla dialogue.
There's no time for monologues now.
Soon six months after the elections.
You can't hide in the endlesss, Rinne can understand.
A boy who was 9 years old on a runaway has been found in Finland since the age of nine.
The record was in order at the moment of finding it.
THE kid's been hit and killed, the son's boss updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finnish Police Department will also refer the matter to the Iltalehti magazine.
Went out to play at the top at four o’clock.
Later on, everyone was no longer able to reach me.
Thank you to all those who have been helped in searching for help.
Thank you for the ten contacts and insights you have made during this time.
The update was shared in close to 11,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such an untimely period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wild:
Educated freelancer Makwan Amikhani published the video on Facebook, which appeals to young people with specific immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani spoke out against the street violence.
Amirhani, who has arrived in Finland with his family in Iran and at the age of five, has won both of his Thursdays in the most prestigious UFC series in the free game.
Myrikhani tells me that he has received a message asking for a look at a new account.
There have been videos downloaded, where young people fight with extreme hatred.
My man says he's disappointed in the wild.
In the 26-year-old, Mirkhan has more than 62 000 followers on the agenda.
Others kick on the ground, sit on the other side and look at no matter what these consequences are, what happens when you make these videos, what happens?
Harder to defend than ever before.
Some of the young people on video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Mr. Jarmo Heinos, the Commissioner of the police, he said that the media have been loaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It is not that you fight on the street at all.
You are doing so many other immigrants' lives more often here in Finland, says the Labourer Amirkhaani.
My reason is that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed in Finland.
The number of individual cases has become quite gross.
A little bit longer, boys, to defend you again.
You should remember that you are still staying in the world and you will be quite the strangest guests here.
That's a little different from thanking you for being here, says Amikhani.
Something tells young people to remember close by.
If they ever go after a racist, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Now, why don't you guys think about it a couple times before you go out with them, guys?
My man says that violent action will make a contribution to racism.
You're the one who gets the idea of what I don't think I do.
You've got a pretty bad thing for each of you, and you're not going to make it any better, Amikhani decides.
SAK puts his position on the savings package - Thursday: the decision is taken on Monday.
Mr Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, is aware that on Monday, the consumer organisation will express its views on the alternative savings of the JRC.
Lauri Lyly's comment on the TSI's proposal is well-informed.
In the past Wednesday, the staff member’s staff member’s STK announced that it would present to the public its own proposal, whereby the 5% productivity gap required by Juha Sipilä (medium) would be reached.
The President of the Committee, Mr Sture Fjäder, believes that the proposed proposal is proposed by the Bureau, if the SK, the STS and the Plan are behind all the proposals.
However, it would require that the largest wage and salary body, SAK, to smooth its position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, President of Sak, commented in a vague way on this matter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will be examining the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, Sak is looking for solutions to "open the labour market door" and that, instead of coercion laws, active parties need to enter into agreements.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilän's proposal for a social agreement did not give the SAK any assurances that the agreement had been concluded.
She had previously negotiated a social deal when SAK refused to commit to a 5% productivity target.
Comment: A grand demonstration threatens to warm up - "It feels like it's a little funny to wood a fist."
It seems a little funny to wood your fist, if there's already a play paper in your pocket, written by Pekka Tiinanen.
The climate is changing from side to side in the wager camp.
Is there going to be a call for a voice or is there going to be a match for that?
On Monday, the SAK's allies broke out against the Holy Church government.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the most desperate ones as well.
OAJ, a trade union of teachers, threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
Tuesday, OAJ suggested that no school or day-care centres would be excluded.
On Wednesday, Mr. Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STC, appeared in agreement.
He found that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity increase as required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium).
President Sture Fjäder (Kok) rushed immediately to announce that his agreement paper has already been completed.
At first, there was no word from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree when the meetings just on Monday told him to put the earth on the earth on the earth on the earth.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the issues and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for the employees to have a joint proposal, the SAK should be inclined to accept 5% of the productivity target.
Nothing, of course, is that the Fireola ICT has relations with the public of Sipilä.
The right hand of the fire, the communicative director of the JRC, Jukka Inus, was previously a special assistant to the Central Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
It is true that the government's ay-knowledge has been over and over again.
It's a coincidence or not, but the fire came out of the world's stand-ups, whose face is taken by the A.K. Marko Region (sd).
It seems a little funny to be working on a punch if there's already a play paper in the pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Detailed information on Lynn's comment is available on this item.
The Prime Minister called Finland a bad idea: "It must not be repeated".
Russian President Sergei Narryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
In the view of the President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Narryshkin, the Russian President, Mr Sergei Naryshkin, is a better OSCE father than he is Finland.
At Ulan Batori, the capital of Gora, the International Assembly of the OSCE, in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki Annual Assembly.
Finland did not allow the European Union to come to a meeting of politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to join the European Union - a matter which Mr President recalled the officials.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of democratic democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not be repeated, Mr. Narysh also stressed the news office according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where his presence had also been prevented.
The sanctions are humane from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation went on to say a few things, so Naryshkin continued to thank Finland with praise and thanks him for "for the very very very good of the truth".
I'm sure the general public assembly will go smoothly and with the same result - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
I understand that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met at Ulan Batori with the leading Ilkka Kanervan (kok), which is already in the middle of the debate with the Delegation.
There's a hole in the real playoff: "The paints are tight".

The police went to Kuopu to check out 3-2-and-a-time gain from Kalpa.
The rise was manic, for the silver group in the last month was at least two goals out of a position of success.
The count on Tuesday was a mollusc victory.
The Roman catch of the stars who had taken off in the bag was the same as the present point, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, the paints are tight, if at all they play the same game as last year, Lock-a-builer Janne Lahti is expecting to set up on the following pages.

Rautalalio’s game philosophy does not include rowing and long-term learning.
It's a tough game, but it's a different thing to a tough game than a pig.

He got 2+10 minutes from the judge, but Rautalalio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!

No doubt that the master coach has chosen a talent.

Olga had been the last Sirka before the film project, but since then, two people have gone a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone and texted.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've been going through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the circus also understands that the drama is a drama, and it may be necessary to colour a little bit.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Helpland would become the largest in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression and a real pain in the ass.
It's quite a small probability that someone will actually succeed, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot about this youth before you made it.
However, the stories of parents have not been very different in the past.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, you know what you really know.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from that known as Heinola’s evil-pained scepter as the well-known Heinola Heinola Heinola Heinola.
Olga was an everyday girl, and she was a nice girl, and she wouldn't have had anything to do with the movie tutka.
At most, he could've kept a secret.
According to Olga, he has worked so hard with the pulak for 10 years that the joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the whole production will be in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in the country are often going to drive home because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're going to rule all of Heinola for a month.
They have truly welcomed us, only to ask what streets and when to waste.
Iron Sky 2 is Finland's most expensive drama film.
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film is 17 million euros.
The recordings will begin in February in Belgium.
Director Voyurensola is starting to film the Iron Sky 2 film in February in Belgium.
Scifi film The Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be Finland's most expensive feature film of all time with its 17 million-million-dollar budget.
In the past, Jalmari Helander's Big Gamelle has been the most expensive film title in Finland.
The current Angry Birds animation is also coming to an end after the completion of Iron Sky 2, because the film has a budget of more than EUR 100 million.
The screenings of the film directed by Voorensola and by Tero Farland begin in July at the premises of Aed Studios near Antwerp and last for three weeks.
Director Timo Võorensola is going to Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I'm totally out of my mind.
I mean, I'm thinking so relaxed with the file script, because I know exactly what movie to come from.
Everyone at work seems to realize that we should do something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Time is tight, there's no fear in your head.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the public, he'll tell the evening magazine.
The original film budget was set at 8-10 million, but it was also written in writing.
The budget is big, but there is a big scorer.
However, 100 people would be forced into the film, because each angle and effect are so narrow.
It's all been so fucked up that there's no find.
The film company Iron Sky The Universe launched a financing campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8% this Wednesday.
The final rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In no more than two years' time, the company will repay the loan.
The film features, for example, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or chalet?
Big sisters go back to their shirts.
In recent times, great logos have been embellished by the trends in the schedule series.
The last time a fashion-conscious learner avoided clear and large logos like Crocsja in the console.
The promotion of a hood or T-shirt was seen as some kind of skank.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The public has become the right fashion mega order, as well as the old, familiar sports fashioned roles, such as Adidas and Nike, have risen to the wave of heat.
And so often, at first, the bounds of fun and legend are fuzzy: if something is already right, it starts to turn into an irony and a clash.
At first, there was a normal score trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, in which the trend series would prefer as boring basic clothes as possible as a way of separating themselves from the mass.
Now we're going to stick on a grey base colle instead of a button on the back of the buried vertebrae, which faces the logo of the manufacturer.
The bigger and the better, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' identified track-liners, favorite team playing shirts and New York Yankee flags have made a return to the Union.
The Calvin Klein logos of the alkkars are now a cool detail, starting at the edge of the jeans.
Trade seems to be moving from the Sportmark to the luxury brands as well.
The Versace's side of the occult sounds makes it clear what kind of illustrative clothing this is about.
Would you be ready to work out your logos when you're getting ready?
The Russian politician found the evidence: I didn't get stuck in a gas station for hours!
It is claimed that there would have been a special incident in the Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, the producer of products from the US, was held 2015.
Over the past few days, there have been widespread colourful claims in Russia that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to separate the large Lots from the tank hatch for six hours.
Zotov has recently done everything he can to deny the information.
He was still on his own public web page, even on his own public web page, a picture where he seems to be looking at the door of the armored man in very good moods, and at least those images are not about being stuttered or angry.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't get involved in the tank, but it was the BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel, I am serving at the Ural.
I went in, looked around and came out in private, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't take five hours in that position, he said.
For the Russian TV channel, Potov explained that he was fascinated by the new method in the opposition, as he himself was a former professional soldier.
I was worried about what was inside the shed, and I was fascinated by our way of doing it.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
In all tanks.
In the next vision, I intend to definitely visit all the tanks and all the RVs, Zotov promised.
Otov also called the reporter who made the call a fool of him.
I mean, everybody else did.
Nothing was ever there.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but there's nothing like being stuck in a tank, not happening, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the claim of wearout has been published, although in the arms trade for a few days the total number of 50,000 people has been released.
The argument that Zotov got drunk began at the beginning of the Bloknot.ru case, in which they told their hangers about the tanking and threatened to shoot everyone around, and he would not get out of the surface.
Later, the Bloknot site developed a start-up case in which the exhibition organisers told us about what had happened to them.
Everyone is just used to the fact that they jump fast out of the armored pieces.
Mr. Zotov, a Member of the European Parliament, due to his large size, was simply stalling when he came out.
In no way did he sit there for five hours, said the exhibition's coordinator, Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a foreign subsidiary of Canada.
The purified process water of the mines has leaked into the so-called enrichment sands of the bay.
According to each of them, the measures to correct the bleeding have been initiated.
The pool has a foaming process of neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
The water is either either re-usable or re-directed, as appropriate, through the coating box to the environment.
The year was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was found.
According to each of them, the quality of the leak water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
the substance was not released into the environment.
The leaks were found in the morning of Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the pool of dams.
The author tells us about his close cooperation with the police to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent jobs.
Dansken Kuuppaaski: IMF to make sure you don't cut too much.
The Finnish Country Report, published today by the IMF IMF, largely reflects the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland’s leading structural reforms to overcome the economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime and paid vacancies would support Finland's existence.
Reforms would be necessary for the whole contract system and for the protection of employment.
According to Danske Bank's chief economic owner, Pasi Kuuppamäki, there are also differences in terms of structural reforms.
The IMF estimates that there is a comprehensive message for government action, but there is also a warning of what should not be cut.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamaki tells the House of Economics.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be carried out as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects a 0.4 per cent growth rate for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske is expecting today to see its new cyclical forecast of growth on the back of the year.
The IMF is a little optimistic from now on.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
In this morning, total output was recorded during the summer in a small economic activity, Kuoppamäki stated.
It is likely that less attention will be paid to the narrower dimensions or the so-called softer dimensions.
In some cases, however, there is only a few per cent of the decimal country.
The dying Nintendo appointed the new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who had died in late July under Satube Iwata, was working on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was the most popular and charismatic event in the game.
For example, ita responded to the launch of a genuine Wii console.
Choosing a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimisma is a safe choice for Iwata's footprints, evaluation by Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task is to involve Nintendo in mobile games, so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
In Finland there is an increasing number of underage asylum seekers arriving in Finland.
The Swedish Immigration Service already recognised in February 2015 that hundreds of children who have entered the country will disappear every day.
This has been reported, among other things, by SZT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear annually.
Juha Kanselma, the Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in the "underland" year?- In Finland, in 2012, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made by a minor who was alone in 2012.
They're on the count of nine.
In 2014, the corresponding requests were sent to 196 and lost 11 people.
In the absence of a missing person, the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying for the Dublin Regulation may be that the applicant is already registered and may have been found to be of full age there.
The applicant may be more prone to disappear than to continue the matter in Finland and to be sent to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons are also included when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were submitted for annulment on the grounds that the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so that in the last 16 years, he says, there were no adult asylum seekers missing.
Amount in progress?
By 6 September of this year, a total of 576 applications for asylum for a minor have been submitted to us alone.
Statistics on the number of underage asylum seekers missing this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
How did the decision change?
Is there any other way of saying "the dark labour market"?
This is a difficult matter to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the decisions, the Commission stresses.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Petter Orpo (kok) has been involved in the growing number of non-registered immigrants.
He has taken action on this matter.
During the EU Prime Minister's meeting on refugee issues, Mr Orpo spoke on Monday about the practical steps to be taken to manage asylum seekers through the stream of asylum to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen, who has lost his job in the media sector, is now on the market for TV and radio production.
Mikkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells on Huuvu.net equipment that had previously been the most advanced equipment in her field.
The first issue of the online announcement was the first web site in Italy.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind for economic development.
In the global media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer described.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be excitement.
Of course, the system is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these too, as long as there is currently modern material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and self-study architects, Nina Mikkonen inquired about IS.
The reason for this sale is that Mikkos is trying to move away from their present home in Stormsky.
There's no way we can bring all the goods with us.
I've just started to invent and see what stuff they're giving up.
I'm starting now, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV or radio equipment.
After recent myocardial infarction, it is clear that your career will not return to work again.
Ms. Mikkonen notes that now there is nothing but goods and equipment.
The actual life work of Timo T.A. Mikkonen was already carried out in the summer in the National Audiovisual Institute, which was visited by representatives to pick up films and other materials from Storms.
Transport is most threatened by a shift than expected: Metro and trams can move all over the place.
The drivers of the metro and tram today decide whether to extend their efforts to some protest.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram transport for only one of the moods that would take place.
During the day, it is decided whether to run the traffic all day.
Chief Commissioner Pekka Monkonen says that the pride is high on the field.
Night and shift doors are causing a terrible rise in drivers, so the government's plans to cut the lines are a source of opposition.
The monster wondered, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stand together, the traffic in the capital region is virtually completely in a state of stagnation.
According to VR data, the trains will not pass between 6 am and 6 am.
Friday, there will be no nearby and no long-distance traffic.
The stations that left the morning will be driven to destination stations.
According to HLL, most of the buses are left in the stables.

Repo says that HL is not able to do exactly what buses are going through.

The Muslim boy was held in a school in Pakistan, and the teacher made his own clock a bomb.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since his teacher held the home-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to explore the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to a juvenile detention cell in handcuffs.
Mohamed has not really been said to mean that he had made a watch.
Still, there is still a possibility that the boy would be accused of doing more lies.
According to Mohamed, the police had known that there had been a time when they looked like "the movie bomb".
The clock is in lock-up, but it was made up of a known circuit board and a digital display between which there was a lead.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamia was forced to go to school for three days.
His father is angry with the case and the American Council of the United States of America is asking if there is only one demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK Kohisee - Director of Labour asked him to sing a national song.
In song, God is worshiped to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
The Court's criticism of the press has also been accompanied by representatives of the Corbn's own Labour Party.
This is an insult to the public, reported by the Labour Representative, Kate Green, during the BBC radio interview.
I think that Corbyn should have gone to the song.
At yesterday's memorial event, the fight against Luftwaffe in 1940 was summed up by British Air Force fighters.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its opinion and urges him to pay tribute to the players by taking part in the event.
We're all in a huge debt of gratitude for the attack of the Royal Air Force Housekeepers.
He (Corbyn) stood up with respect during the National Song, and stated in the opinion.
Corbyn's election to the chairman has divided the laboratory lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the end of the economy and public procurement.
For the first time today, Corbyn is scheduled to be present in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time for the first time.
Corby has asked the public about what David Cameron should be thinking about.
Cameron crawled at the weekend in knowledge of Corbyn's selection for the event.
Workers are under threat from our national security, economic security and the security of our families, Prime Minister of yours on your own account.
The reason for my family's death is still unclear - my father was waiting for a legal case.
South Lake Kusttonka police have been investigating the death of a family in Greenwood, Minnesota, shortly a week.
The five homes were found dead at home in 10 and a couple of months later, they found that the shooter was home Brian Scott Moving, 45.
After first taking his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Six killed the house in the garage.
Dead for years for days.
Find her after she was worried about the child's absence at school.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house to visit, and they were living in different parts of the house.
According to StarTribu, it is possible that the victims were killed for days.
Quarterly and joint venture
The case of Michael Sitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Kistonka, is still under investigation.
The motive for blood actions is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property at the social media site AllNurses.com, which was directed to nurses.
In 2014 StarTribune in the interview Short multiplied the site by four different prices per week.
I've been offered 50 bids for the last 10 years.
I've abandoned everything.
I still have a lot of ideas for what I want to do.
Perhaps at some point in the sale, but not yet.
Loss was seen, among other things, that in 2011 the family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow for the calendar night of the car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house but also eight garages sufficient for the eight cars.
The case is pending.
However, according to Dr.Tribune, his father was waiting for a legal case.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered various pre-supping courses, had requested him to be entitled to receive his comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments were removed from Short's site to discourage pre-publishing courses, and thus they had lost customers to their customers.
However, according to Mr. StarTribune, it is very unclear whether there would be any significant impact on the transaction.
Vesku Loiri offered coffee coffees.
In addition, the third party was awarded at the event in Finland with the Hippus month lottery owner.
This is great, Loiri commented on a nice day's work.
The Marked Factory Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and won 100 000 euros.
Lori, an artist's legend, was still confused about the defeat of Factory Duo in the Grand Competition.

"The gift of all the greatest athletes"
The Canadiens Superstar P.K. Subban has donated ten grand (about EUR 6.7 million) to the children’s hospital.
According to the information provided by the hospital, it is the single donation made by all-time athletes to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has committed to helping the hospital in another fundraiser for the next seven months.
Subban concluded a three-year and 72 million-dollar agreement between the Canadiens three years ago.
Thus, the sum of the subban contribution is more than his nine millionths of the year.
A reward for his donation to Subban will be placed in the hospital as an emergency room.
Canadiens players have helped local hospitals at first.
Then the deceased long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars, including one of the children's hospitals and Saku Koivu collected a lot of money for another major hospital in the city, where the PET scanner needed for the research into the hospital was obtained.

In short, 150 million vehicles are connected to the network: the launch of attacks on the security of cars is now underway.
In addition, the Autonomous Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as announced by Intel.
The municipality is composed of high-level safety experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing safety tests and actions aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel is the first of the best practices of cyber security in public.
In future, the report will be updated on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The National ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that, by 2020, some 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network.
Bad things are better than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 per cent of the vehicles can consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars," says Intel Security Director General Chris Young.
The ASRB allows Intel to establish best safety practices and to support the belief that cybersecurity is an essential component of the design of every network-connected engine.
Bad things are better than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB panel the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.

Song Chisu is part of the Life for the Child concert with other domestic stars.
There is a visible, open neck opening in an electronic end-dress.
Located beautifully in the singer's screaming belt.
A whole new crowned beech and a red lipstick.
During the three-year break, the second singer who has become pregnant has lost their way with only one exercise and yoga.
Chisu's prospect will be completed in a year.

I've had terrible things to do with music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will be publishing his fourth album called Polaris in a few weeks' time.
The new life situation has inspired new things to be done.
Here, you're actually wondering if you're gonna find my new album, Chisu.
Kim Kardashian's mother is astonishing again - now she's looking at the front.
Realtv beauties Kim Kardashian give a talk after each other.
She was looking at her pregnancy stomach and her breast care freely in a sexual state, last night at one hour when she left her sister's office with Kourtney Kardashian, a husband from Kanye West's gig.

The top Manon Leloup wanted to have the right idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.

The season begins with nothing.
In the second period, you would have posed in the costumes of the top planners, a new period in the castings again.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for work with congruents.
The model obviously has a place to call home.
work is ongoing and can go to a year in such a way that the place of residence is a room or a house in which fashion houses can accommodate their standards.
If you are young and your mother cannot go along with you, being alone can be incredibly difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just the decency.
Agents in New York may ask for lost pounds, but then in Paris you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk.
Models and designers are always at the same time working as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is hazy.
The models want to be in this field because of the possibilities it offers, but let them know that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation.
Models can also be their own person.

You can also make a model work.

Changed by Rope Salminen to make the most unknown Helper in a movie.
Roope Salminen presents Antti Latala as a founding member of the Association in the early years.
The stage was founded in 1991 by Toni Wirtas, but resigned in 1994.
This is a pretty tough problem for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rapist, and in this movie I'm going to play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen.
I've never wanted to see the real Antti before, because I want to make it my own story.
It's obvious that it's for people who don't know, so I think I'm good at learning what they're saying.
I don't want to do the math about human beings.
The man who pilots Rope Salminen and Dogs isn't going anywhere.
The punk-man turns come with the man in fact.
The stars, the stars, they sure saw the first taste, so if it's on us.
Our existence has never been anything small, but always complete.
During the year 1999-2004, the main performers of the film "You Make A Beautiful" were announced today at the Tuukka Temoen station.
The nuclear force known to the audience of Bandi is still relatively unknown to the general public by young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santa Claus is performed by Teppupu Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo from Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen tipped me about the forthcoming plague last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Rope has already seen a picture of the new scene he's had to create for the film last night.
Roope, previously seen in the hair and jaw, has been ingly lynched and dyed with brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is what you tell your children about refugees.
A lot of people in the first few days have had to wonder how to tell the child about the situation of the refugees who are seeking a Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to speak on this point, Member of the SPR's crisis report, as a psychologist, Mr Ferdinand Garoff advises.
A minor child needs to be protected and, for example, should not be allowed to watch all of them alone.
The little ones are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and bother, he does.
However, if the child has had a lot of news about the refugees or discussed the matter elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to discuss the child’s departures and to see exactly what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the child imagines to be afraid of.
Lasta does not want to be afraid, if she does not worry and fear herself.
The older child closely follows the conduct of his parents.
If you stay calm during the conversation, the child will also feel alive.
The main ones are likely to have a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to have a talk with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that people in the world are not good at things.
Parents and their children can think about how we can live with this.
After all, is the world a safe place or a safe place?
Parents may also have different perspectives - perhaps they want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, when you talk about difficult things, you get an idea of how to deal with the truths that come to life.
This could be useful for the future.
The psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children more easily".
Own forces at the top?
Still, you can still be your child’s best shot.
The rain-emitting globe of Ballsalaland is hard to understand.
Pertt Pohjola was able to beat Apala's Ballsalama in the middle of the strike.
It only made profits and 2nd lines until at the end of June, in the peaks of Tampere, there was a breakdown.
Since she was in deep trouble, the coach suspected something wrong and ordered to be protected from time to time.
The explanation of how we left out was clear in the audience.
The horse had a laryngitis.
It was not the easiest way to get away, but it was the need for a two-year course of medicine to stop it.
Because the Apilan Palshallama may be in the mind of exercise, Ostrobothnia is sure to say that it is a surprise of the last run.
It was in Turku in record time after another SE-mama Taruntuple.
Apilan Pals Salama was on a break when it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
The little tendency of good things at the end was understandable, says the North.
The coach assumes that I'm going to open up competition for them.
The sound of the horse went from that to that, and it would also be abhorrent.
Apilan Pällsalama has been so-called humorous horses.
It's not fun, it's fat, even when it's sick.
On the other hand, today it has been so hard to say that the adversaries were in wonders.
In the run-by, there are no match-makers acting on the Balloon, which is very warm-blooded by visitors.
In the hopes of the Nordic Region, the Vermo has a farce run in its hive.
However, it is different how Aplan Palletalama agrees to it.
It's time to start at the time of departure and may even be at the bottom of the getaway and that's it.
I wish that the ori would be better than Market's.
Apilan Pällsalama is also in good condition, coming out of the bow, and we're going to drive it out of profit, coach's permission.
For this reason, you will not be able to get rid of the unnecessary iPhone programmes.
The operational management of the operation is Tim Cook.
At least some of the programmes that accompany Apple's iPhone phones may actually be deleted today - but not all of them.
Apple is likely to be able to remove some of its own programs from the iPhone phones, reports the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed magazine interview.
There are a number of programs on Apple's iPhone that are actually rarely used: for example, FaceTime talk, Magazine, Healthys, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which was forced to use iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smartphone owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complex than it seems on top of.
The applications have been linked to another icon.
If they are deleted, it may cause trouble somewhere on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfed.
Cook did not know which Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
At the same time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook your add.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory from the computer's iPhone phones.
The euro area GDP went down by 0.1% in August.
Consumer prices in the euro area fell only slightly during the period, i.e. by 1% of the year-on-year, EU Statistics Eurostat reported today.
The fall in prices was driven down by a low level of low energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a few more weeks ago the estimate of 0.2 years is slightly downwards.
In March, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called bottom inflation fell by 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
The estimate for the euro was 1,0.
Energy was 7.2 per cent lower in the euro area last month.
The total EU average of 28 countries was in the middle of August.
One per cent of the total loss came in the course of the past.
In the euro area, the highest, or 1.4 per cent, of consumer prices went up in Malta.
Per cent of GDP was lowest in the fall of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, consumption was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU's harmonised index.
Euro area GDP remains close to the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is two per cent likely to rise in the medium term.
The average GDP per capita of the euro area over the year is 0.1%.
Next year, the growth rate will be 1.1 per cent, and the central bank forecasted in its new forecast at the beginning of the first quarter of the year.
The United States is now trying to tighten up monetary policy.
The second recession will begin at least less than a year later, but probably within three years after the country's Fed is back on track for a long time.
And on the financial market, in turn, first of all, the first recession begins.
Fed has been suggesting that he will be starting the meetings this year and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next downturn can be triggered at least by the next time and in the financial market before that.
That is at least what happens if the world economy and the financial market act the way they have been - and if they deal with the tightening of Fed's finances as they have done before.
The main conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s strategies in the London market for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive long-term market and economic analysis.
The bank distributed over 60-person Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international major customers last year.
The methods drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed is going to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of the economic statistics to determine how the economy and the market have previously evolved during and after Fed's weightings.
In addition to the critical criteria, they will look at what economic and financial market central variables are now in the same or similar way as in previous sales - and what might result from this.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a much more economical state to bear the high level of expenditure than ever before in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, it may not be a year.
The leaders of Fedi's finances and of its own mistakes have been suggesting over the past summer and the beginning of the autumn that the time is beginning to be ready to raise the exchange rate.
The first increase of more than nine years could come this month.
This will be resolved by Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised the so-called Fed funds control rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the ratio of two years to a regular but at one time a small 0,25 percentage points of the amount of interest charged by Fed increased its ratio from 1.25 % to 5.25 %.
The general financial market held in 2007 the difficulties of the United States' most risk-sensitive credit facility, and one year later, the financial crisis became a major cause of the crisis.
The main downsizing was in 2009.
The last time the serious financial and real-life developments were slower than ever since the loan purchases in Fed had been made.
Similarly, the trials were, after all, tougher and rougher than ever before in the 1930s depression.
The strategies of the European Union have been looking at the peaks and billings of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial market since and from the beginning of the 1800s onwards.
In the early 1950s, they will make clear the main points of interest and their economic and interaction with each other.
The beginning of the recession has been, at least, over a period of at least one year since the first drawdown, often less than two years and, most often, less than two and a half years after the start of the recession.
The rise in the financial market has ended within two years of the start of Fed's borrowings.
Fed has in turn picked up and in turn calculated his guidance rate since the early 1950s by a dozen different dimensions.
Each time is different in some respects, and the times are considered relatively little, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the cost of the following charges.
They therefore point out that this time many things are different.
It's not better than that.
The interest rate too low is too long.
For the main reasons of the financial crisis, even those responsible, it is not necessarily necessary to find out without doubt even decades of research.
the fact of the crisis and of the reasons for its strength, it seems that there is no doubt that:
1) Fed, the ECB and other major central banks in the world held their help rates too low in the 21st century.
They were patching up the Teknokum mark, and they grew the next one.
2) The economic and real economy has accumulated over the years and is already too large in terms of the impact of excessive monetary policy in the global economy.
A major currency bubble was born in the back economics.
3) In particular, the financial crisis in the financial sector, particularly in the face of the financial crisis, increased to most financial market segments by the largest exchange rate bubbles from shares in real estate, bonds and assets in the current financial history.
It is hard to doubt that, in the face of more and more domestic shocks, the heights of the increased financial market were rarely dangerous and unstable, while Fed and others were driving upwards.
General government debt securities, at the same time as the valuation curves, did not last until the start of the period when the weightings had started and the cost of the lending had gone down.
As a result of the financial crisis, the financial situation followed by a large recession.
Larger bubble and more
The strategies of the jun do not guess what happens next, but they provide the subject of suspicion, for example, with the following points:
(1) Fed and other major central banks have now held their monetary stance even further than before.
If they were too low in the past, they are now even longer still.
2) Debt has not long been mad as it was then, but now the money is literally cheaper than it is.
The economic and real economy debt has not been relieved, but now, in various parts of the economy, there is a much more severe financial burden than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) For the most part, the central bank's central bank's central bank foreign currency has remained on the financial market and has delayed certain types of securities and assets at or above the top of the financial crisis.
In addition, they point out that the economy has not yet recovered from the world of the economy and for decades from the most serious recession than has happened before.
The euro area economy has barely come to an end at all.
In fact, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but most of all, the pressures and risks of the financial market are disproportionately greater than before the financial crisis, as Fed next starts to tighten up his finances.
The picture of the world of Albert Edwards's future of the former Societe Generale strategy is not as obvious as it may seem.
He has been training the bank's international investors in Fedi for some time now in the following translations:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the planets explode, and soon Fedin's time has come to run out of the budget for even more major QE seasons.
Computers and printing Hewlett-Packard (HP) is trying to generate up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions relate to HP's private service side, the company tells.
will be distributed in January to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which will focus on retail sales, and to HP Inc., which will focus on working pcs and outputs.
HP had the highest number of posts in 2011, with 30,000 employees.
Last October, staff had been reduced to 302000.
One-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion) per item of the arrangement.
Hewlett Packard on the Enterprise is launching between 25,000 and 30,000 people.
Half the reductions will remain in 3300 over a period of two years.
HP is trying to transfer the investment to the HGD, so that 60% of its employees would be low costs in 2018.
It says that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers anymore account for more than 5% of its operating result.
In the second year, 65% of the operating result was generated by its three largest customers.
iOS 9 How to get access to the operating system after an update of the Apple update release.
A new operating system may request a new Regulation application, by clicking on the "General" button and then using the "Software Regulation".
If the update is ready, the phone will give you an option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation since the "programme update failed" error reported to one of them.
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst congestion to pass or try to update via iTunes.
Allows the user to guide the end of the process.
This may include the removal of applications in order to obtain status, but Apple has reduced this by a small amount of update and has also attempted the process with a new tool that proposes to delete applications and then restart them when updating.
It is worth ensuring that the phone has been charged or is close to the charger during the update that the battery is not running at the moment.
If the charging level is too high, the Apple will not allow the update to go down, because if the battery is running out of time, it can cause the update to be cancelled.

Yle: Minister Berner has been working in the general public of the Tax Goods Company.
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berne (medium) has worked as a member of the tax union.
The company's activities involved so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg-based Telli II LuxCo company, who was appointed as a member of the Berner in February 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still a member of the Board of Directors.
Mr. Berner himself says that he has submitted a resignation notice for his membership this late this year.
I checked it out, and that's all I've done is leave a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that the registration chains are on schedule, says Berner in the Yle interview.
After the merger, the formation of the formation after the merger followed the formation of the merger.
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg branch.
Kähs is a carpentry manufacturer, who blended in with Finnish parking manufacturer Karlia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked in the Karélia-Upoflor government in the years 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs government and in the Luxembourg community.
According to Yle, the ownership of Kährs is carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-faceted institutional structure.
Mr. Berner tells Yle that he accepted a majority member of the Luxembourg branch, Kährs, at the request of the second largest owner.
The owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have participated in the public of Karelia-Upofor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partnership was sought which was found in Sweden.
The company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the reality of the Finnish family.
It is important that we ensure that the capital returns of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the principle is safeguarded in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that the property of Hartwall Capital does not belong to a tax scheme.
According to Berner, the complex ownership of the tax system is due to the fact that Kährs's largest owner of the capital, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company for ownership.
The company’s new reception centre will be opened in Espoo.
The first company’s company’s reception centre will be opened in the territory of Espoo for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this afternoon onwards.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service is setting up a reception centre at the property of the former Finnish Rescue College.
The service is operated by Luuna Oy, which has a particular scope for the provision of health care and health care services.
The City of Helsinki, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy, among other things, agree on central security arrangements.
STÖ is working on an alternative work-life tightening package.
The Committee will take steps to prepare an alternative package for the public's working life to be tightened up.
There is also a hope for other consumer associations.
According to President-in-Office Palola, the current focus is on one statement.
The means to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone realizes that after the dawn of life, Palola called on the public administration meeting to take a break from the journalists.
Palola estimated that, on the other hand, the central industrial policy (EC) was not prepared for discussions.
The ESC's economists have calculated that the protection of the changes contained in the government's component package will cost the employer approximately EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm to discuss this conversation if there's a single relationship with one hundred.
Palola: The negotiations were constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) has hoped for alternatives by Wednesday, as it is due to submit its own package to Parliament and to begin the preparation of the reforms.
Palola did not take the view that the schedule was realistic.
The debate on the press is with the Papola, and it has been constructive all along.
According to the Fireola, the staff organisation’s staff organisation’s mission to the STK field is a tough place.
The organization requires that power be accused of forceful legislation, which would be part of the tensions.
In the STKKK, the Papola does not welcome the preparation of an option package with the SDP, the representative of the SDP.
The wage and salary earners are all over Helsinki to resist the last resort to the work-life tightening package.
As part of the package, the salary for the first few days of work is cut, the overtime is reduced to 75 %, the allowances are reduced to 75 % and the leave is reduced.
The ESC calls on the central bodies to invite employees to protest and has not intended to strike a strike.
Mrs Fjäder said something about the plan.
The President, Mr Fjäder, congratulates the JRC on the announcement that an alternative package has been prepared.
According to Fjäder, the TSI is now on the same agenda with Plana, as there is already a longer-term model for the presentation of the company.
The Fjäder hopes that Sak will also be included in the alternative package, without the SAK package being complete.
The President, Mr. Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Mr. Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare the presentation for the presentation.
The Anti Palolan TSI told me earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
Migration security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, he announced that he had already prepared his own presentation, which was prepared for the goal of 5% of the country's national food industry as an alternative to the company.
The plan has always been ready for the first time, and we have long been drawing up an alternative model for the presentations of the government.
We are prepared to maintain the general terms and conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In contrast, we want security of change and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that Sak will also come to the side of the plan, as the TSI has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without Sak, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the world and employers, Fjäder says.
The AA Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously made choices during the Mäntsälä rebellion and during the period.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks well of the nation's economic situation in Finland on the Upper Channel on Wednesday at 20.05 p.m.
The Prime Minister's first speech must be applied for until 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was supposed to be giving a famous radio call at the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and the ministers then made a number of conversations during the winter and the war on the future.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave President Mauno Koiisto instead of New Year's speech, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976 Mr. Urho Hekkonen quit the railway station on his mobile phone.
Dialogue, a multidisciplinary conversation, and I'm going to say something.
This talk has been asking all day about criticism and thinking about what I'm going to do.
President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated in his knowledge that "The voice of the state of the nation in Parliament could be given as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also make the speech very clear".
According to the Green Ville Juys, "the interlocutor has already been seen.
Management involves dialogue, listening to people.
The Erkki Juhja of SDP condemned the fact that "from the monarchist to the better: the truth tells the people what is right for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A half a year from the elections, six months from the elections.
There is no need for an individual to appear in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you worried about?
public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has already been recorded for about 15 minutes and long.
According to SAK, it was commented directly on by the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, and the Executive Director of the EK Järämies.
The above has been criticised for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that a public service mission would contribute to the general public in the whole of the world, in the news, by Ismo Silvo Ylen, Director-General of the Ismo Silvo Ylen.
It's like our time in Tammalo.
The speech has also given rise to venerations.
At the latest, it will be day-to-day on time, the children will be combed and dressed at their best.
I'm going to put on the cutest bitch and my dad's going to make up for his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we're going to be on the road as before, at the time of the Tammelós," literator Saku Tutnen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipila also say in his speech why there are millions of people sitting in the world in tax havens hiding their capital, who make love laws for other tax-governanced friends and at the same time claim to the people that they must be cut off when the government is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is put forward by the University of Tampere's Green Left Viva.
It has published a new edition of the next bingo.
Do we hear at the same time about the same drive, the common coal, the tax on living and the team?
The domes and pens are ready, at 9:05 p.m., it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Attaria in Guardian: Western countries reject the proposal for the withdrawal of al-Assad.
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to give President Bashar al-Assad a mandate, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Astaris, the Russian Ambassador to the United Nations proposed a way in which al-Assad would have, at some point, retreated from power in a loud manner.
Therefore, the countries of the West did not take the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall every few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five Member States of the UN Security Council.
According to Astisare, the Russian Prime Minister, Vitali Tshurk, in his bilateral debate, listed three points: the opposition must not be armed, there must be immediate intervention between Opposition and Al-Assad, and the surrender of al-Assad had to be done smoothly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can fight openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said that sitting down at Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtari remembers at the Guardian's interview.
Dilmats do not comment on dilates.
Ahtisaari tells us that he forwarded the message to the United States, the United Kingdom and the United States, but nothing happened.
The Czech Republic has not confirmed the content of the debate on the paper, but according to Ahtisaari, there is no two language.
The UN Diploms of the United Nations refused to comment on Ahtisaari's arguments, but they said that Al-Assad had already made a number of murders at this time and that the main opposition groups were seeking all the agreements that he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is concerned with Ahtisaari's speeches with doubts, because, according to his experience, Russia was not at all prepared to see the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting al-Assad all the time.
In a few minutes' time, Ahtisaari argues that the Czech Republic was speaking with the Moscow Council.
If he had told me about the words of the Czech Republic, I would have answered that I wanted to see the second President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
In fact, I would have doubted, in any case, that it would have been Putin's trick to keep hold of any al-Assad supporter.
Refugee our own actions.
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, there were about 7 500 people in Syria who were in crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of death victims exceeded 220 000 in the next year.
Over 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes for their own sake.
We should have prevented this beast from happening.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doings.
All I can do is take good care of these poor people.
We're thinking about the bill that we've actually caused, Ahtisaari says to the paper.
The asylum seeker’s facility is a torty to Tornio.
The local asylum centre of the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The center of the city was built in a building of a complete tower building.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage theflow from the Swedish border.
The City of Sanomat knew on Tuesday that the Board would already have planned to prepare a school building for the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the Tornio Parliament, Mr Sauli Höppinen (left), that is not the case.
When the whole council was not convened and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next year to decide on the matter, and he would specify it to the STT.
There were 36 out of 43 delegations in the current discussion.
The Centre was opposed by 13 delegations.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision would be positive, says Heppinen.
According to Executive Director Timia Nousiainen, the city received an announcement on Monday, and it was promptly approached.
It would be possible to share an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked to see that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred metres from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
Siila still wants to be able to choose from the labour market for one another.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium), the half of the public holiday money would only be managed by part of the budget's objective of calculating the labour price.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative option if the social partners succeed in doing so.
Sipi told the journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how often organizations are looking for alternatives to the work that the government has announced.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will, of course, gladly accept it as part of the whole package.
The half of the holiday money would act as a way of thinking of Sipilä, as it would target almost all employees, rather than, for example, the cutting of a star designed by the government.
The social security organisations could agree on a holiday allowance cut because they are registered under the law as a collective agreement.
The government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a government communication next Wednesday.
According to Sipilä, organisations' proposals should be known before this is the case.
The final date is not the last time either.
Legislative work begins at the time, i.e. the train is moving and it gets easier and harder all the time.
It's a good time now.
It's not too much in these matters, if you want to, Siilä spoke.
Among other things, the government's most recent publication has been the final and bright conversion into unpaid free days, without any exception of the annual working time.
In addition, the first day's pay is cut, the overtime is halved, the allowance is reduced to 75% and the leave is reduced to 75%.
Reforms will be carried out as a powerful law through trade unions, which has caused intense criticism.
Due to the efforts of the IGCs, the IGCs organise one major report, as well as several trade unions have announced the gross domestic product.
The Tohmajärvi Board approved the extension of the madman’s warehouse by the Board of Governors.
The Tohmajärvi Board has approved the extension of the North Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the manager’s store, but not the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall.
The assessment was made by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than the original one.
It's too busy to be angry.
Even a little wonder that the order was known a year ago when we decided on the last extension.
At this point, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 meters was approved for the investment programme, but the funding is decided on an average in the context of the interim report.
The next item is the debate on the investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but the president, Erkki Iconen, announced that the price would be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax income to the place.
The municipality does not have any money, since the company pays for the sale as a loan, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
There is also a place for Karelian language in Joensuu.
The government of the municipality has been easing its strong position in order to bring some of the plain signs in the cattle language to the centre of Joensuu.
The decision is important and proper for the organisation of the tradition of cattle throughout the country.
It does not belong to the capital of the cattle language, for there are no historical grounds for it, nor is the language of the herd naturally part of the region's life.
The language spoken in the river basin has become more widely known for the eastern savoury.
Not after the final decision, there will be no name signs in the cattle language at the centre of the city centre.
However, as a matter of fact, the river is well prepared for the use of the Swedish language, for example, in information boards and in the market in tourism, for example.
The same attitude is recommended by all other operators.
Although Joensuu is currently a single-voting municipality, it is also advisable to be open-minded about the use of the language of the harida now thatQuality is alive and is now changing in North Karelia.
Karelian language is now the special features of the region, as well as the image of the river as the forest of all of Finland.
Each of these can be well used for the benefit of the nation’s entire market.
The interruptions in the pipelines are a source of vitality in the region.
Train connections strike the country's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the county.
And it seems to me that we can live and work here at all, as President-in-Office of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also raised the issue of aviation, which has also been the subject of several reports on several occasions.
For the country as a whole, it is important that we do not have the ability to reduce by means of government measures, as is the case now.
The effects of these disconnections should be seen, for example, for employment, and Karjalainen points out.
The lack of access will cause the University of Eastern Finland to seek additional attention in relation to the attractiveness of access.
Of course, the best things here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees, the rector of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen knows.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels for a long time.
Marko Junkkarinen, head of the recruitment team, says that marketing of the university to West Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are very weak in cross-border terms.
Currently, about half of the students of the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Again, about 10-20% of them are from the U.S.A., which is partly explained by direct connection to the network.
Joensuu became one row for Siu's solo.
The view of the Government of Joensuu on the regional Siu Soite project seems to be unanimous, but there is also one voice among them.
Mr Pentti Kessalo (sd., p.
The Board of Governors adopted the draft decision of President Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of the month before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One weekend from Koupola to Koupola the end of next year.
Civil transport from Eagle to Kouvola will continue to survive, each less than one railing pair.
There will be a change in public transport between Kotka and Kouvola next year.
The two-way partnership is gone, but still five-times pass from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The discounts are the result of the State's transactions.
For the next four years, the Ministry of Transport and the Communications will reduce the amount of urban money to EUR 12.3 million for the next four years.
The most recent routes will be stopped completely.
VR will draw up new plans by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed away, one didn't get down, the guys were living off site.
The Civil Protection Department released a 12-year-old climber who climbed from the roof to the roof, who no longer helped himself down from the roof with his own help.
The event was born in Tornionmä, in Keto, at half-six o'clock on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to be taken from anywhere.
It did not stop the crowd that decided to climb the house away from it along the masts of the radiomagnators next to it.
Other boys got down the same route, but one of them didn't.
As a result, the rest of us were living from the place, and the passers-by alarmed the rescue unit to the place by means of a towing device, the last safe return to the earth for the rest of us safely.
FedEx's net profit is double, accounting for the tax year 2016
FedEx reports on depressing results from the latest quarter, and the delivery leaver cut all year round his performance forecast, due to the decline in demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
He also said that he wanted to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the rest of his stay.
Last year FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5% in the open auction 45 minutes before Wednesday’s opening hours.
FedEx Corp. says that it is expected to end next year by the end of February 10,40-10, 90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were waiting for 10, so let's say it at the bottom of FactSet.
The most recent outlooks were on average 4,9 % of the price increases that entered into force on January 4th, and regardless of the higher charges started in January for the transport of heavy or large parcels by land.
It said that it was looking forward to an increase in net sales from the previous year, as they have cut revenue, increased turnover and growth in net sales.
Fred Smith, President and CEO, said that "the company will be "sustainably performing in the light of the weaker economic conditions expected, especially in production and worldwide trade."
The third-time pay was published on the day after the competitor UPS told me that he wanted to hire between 90 and 95,000 extra workers, as much as it did last year.
In the fourth quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's performance was 692 million, which is 6 per cent more than in the year before.
You get per share came from 2, 42, which remains at the rate of 2, the dollar. 12 analysts asked the answer to Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover went up by 5 per cent to 12.3 billion dollars.
In the middle of Zacks, six analysts were waiting for $12,23.
In recent years, FedEx has been experiencing a decline in priority transport, which has reversed the development of its Express unit turnover.
However, online commerce has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, net sales in the country increased by 29 per cent, but the income in the last quarter was in fact the same for the cost of the major packages and for own insurance.
Express revenue was higher because of higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight was lower than higher labour costs.
At the opening auction, approximately one minute before the opening hours, FedEx's shares dropped to $3,85, or 2.5% to $15,15.
FedEx closed down 11% this year on Tuesday and 17% below the 11th of June record.
The United States Central Bank's leaders are sitting this month around a huge stomach table for the first time in a long-awaited meeting to see if the time has come to raise the interest rate for the first time in the next six months.
On one side of the Central Bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room there is a walling from the United States of America.
The map is a reminder that the President-in-Office of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yllen, and his colleagues, should give priority to the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Congress has placed a dual responsibility on the shoulders of the Central Bank: they must maximise public and keep prices stable in the United States.
However, since the Great Depression, the governors of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also the third, unwritten mandate: stability.
This third requirement may be a factor in a public decision on Thursday, which is so tight that it is not even a premise. It is whether the US economy is ready to be removed from the record record, which, until the end of 2008, has been almost equivalent to the low-long-term ratio .
Most of the information shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent inflow of global financial markets may have pre-empted the already on-the-spot staff of the central bank to the point of increasing instability. Let’s be afraid, if the Federal Fund rate was even increased by one quarter, how would it be possible to increase the reference value of the single currency funds rate?
"Recognisably labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to follow", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economic expert at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for the right to remain equal to the average, the increased uncertainty in the world market is the only reason to wait again," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been reached, which already creates a nervousness in the economy.
According to Bloo's recent research, about half of the economic experts predict an increase in the ratio this year.
The financial markets, on the other hand, expect an increase in the average, as the key indicator suggests that there is only around 30% chance of growth.
This leads to a decline in the securities market, if the central bank reaches a level, so that no decision-making process can be achieved by allowing the next increase to not occur in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index increased by 228,89 points, i.e. 1.4%, while the new one was 16 599,85.
The recovery was accompanied by the expectation that the Central Bank would be kept at a level this time, says John Lonski, chief economic expert in the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's a surprise if the bank is making money right now," she says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must see a lot of trouble in their orientations to support the financial market so that they do not get into it."
Other experts argue that the increased level would calm the financial market as it would eliminate the uncertainty as to where the central bank operates.
A month ago, it seems that it would be this month to increase the ratio by a quarter percentage point, so the first step towards tightening up the financial situation, which would ensure the stability of the United States' recovery.
Yellen has said in the spring and early summer that he expects to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals are demanding further economic development in their appeals.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% in the last month, which is the lowest figure of three months and close to the level that the Fund considers to be the limit of full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of aggravation.
The general government deficit is still below the 2 % annual target, and according to the central bank's decision-makers, this is significantly under-represented by the interim effect of the price of oil.
"the economic situation is even higher than that of the economy, and also needs to be taken into account in the light of the difficult situation on the labour market," says Ian Shepherdson, chief economic expert of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the global financial markets were alarmed by the last time China dewaxed its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index was up to 16% of its May record, when investors feared that the economy would slow down, as well as global growth.
The market has come to a certain extent this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the upper limit of the month of October.
The central bank's decision-makers are also added to the complexity of the market, which tells when the ratio should be raised.
"Without these events on the financial market and recent news about the economic stability of the economy, decisions are being tightened up at this time," says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to get a better idea.
"Possibility of the United States for the economy is still very unclear and has little information at its disposal as to the consequences of the events in China," Oliner states.
The economic performance of the economy is not the main concern of the central economy, so in principle it should not be affected by decision-making.
In practice, however, the central government has become a global monetary government.
In recent years, the power of the Central Authority has been vast.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, the then president, suggested that the Central Bank could "friend" an increase in the amount of money, causing the changes in the market around the world.
In a world where the market and economies are increasingly condensed together, central government officials are likely to be able to see not only the next but also other central banks and to find a better idea of the world economy.
The central bank's decision-making process is "more art than science", says Zachary Karbell, head of the world-class management of the trust fund Eninvestnet Inc.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the Republic of Virginia, Mr Jeffrey Lacker, pointed out this month that "the central bank has previously overreacted its financial markets towards a movement that appears to be distinct from the fundamentals of the economy."
The Federal Open Market Committee, which has taken the decision, has called for an increase in interest, and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee, has, for example, called for a vote in 1998-99.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the Central Bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings "Despite its limited, identifiable changes to the United States of America", Lacker says.
The year before that date, however, these duties expired.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only during a major crisis, such as when markets collapsed in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Nomination Committee.
The last miller will not be anywhere near its level, says Posen.
"No one wants to be in a situation where there is fear of a mid-level increase because the market is being disrupted", says Posen, President of the Institute for International Economics.
As long as this is the case, I do not think it should be envisaged.
Do you want a great Thai trade?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in Chinatown, Chinatown.
This store/storage was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, which is often referred to as the Thai-Costcona, is a thiet store that also sells to individuals.
Yes, it's in Chinatown, not in Thai Town.
The store/storage is a single stop shop that offers an excellent selection of fresh, frozen and dried commodities, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen needs, furniture, as well as academic and educational decorations.
There's also an auto shop, you need an engine.
Europe is huge, and it takes more than an hour to land all the halls.
If you're out of business, you can go to LAX-C BBQ Express.
The grocery store (he, cheap) in the shop is close to the bags, and there are several pick-up options available.
What's in the warehouse: Do you need anything - anything - in the country?
LAX-C is what it is.
The products have been priced in a reasonable way, and most of the products are in wholesale packaging.
The outputs include Asian specialities and Thais, fruits and other products.
It is a wide-ranging, just like the fish counter. The staff behind the counter is behind it and fills the fish and, if necessary, cooks it for you.
A large part of the movement has been reserved for a huge section of frozen curry leaves, hares and gallbladder, whole ducks, fish, beef meat and bile, porpoise, fish bulls, local sausages, eels and more.
Who shopped in: Restaurant owners and works, as well as houses and individuals.
For use in the discs, it's good for both quacks as well as for those who wear them.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it distributes with other shops and restaurants.
Any store may be busy, parking is usually easy.
The Child Health Organization in Rio Grande is a healthy mammalian organisation.
SPRS has come up with a shocking habit of trying to get a good sense of the importance of food during breast-feeding by increasing the image of babies in their breasts with pictures of unsafe food.
The breast milk is made up of various proteins, fats, vitamins and compounds that give babies all the nutrients they need for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily target by about 500 calories.
However, the new research suggests that increasing the target is not the only transformation that should be done by the mothers.
The recent study conducted by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the health of pregnant women in fact affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from growth.
There is no doubt that an unhealthy diet is likely to have an effect on the immune system of the child.
The Seven-channel Sunrise program is a favorite feature, despite Nine's efforts to inform the manager of the Today Show program.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's march to Canberra to announce the latter of the Liberal Party's presidential revelation failed to add Today to your viewers.
The Nine channel news program was sent from the capital of the country after the Turnbull ran out of power to Tony Abbott.
The competing program Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week’s series of broadcasts, covering also the fall of Dubai, New York, Niagara and Cancun.
The distance from weight seemed to be no harm to any of the other TV coverage companies since Sunrise’s average audience in the five capitals was 30,000 when Today’s figure was 339 000.
Today's average increased to Monday (37,000) and last Tuesday (28,000) figures, but it was still lower than last Thursday (32,000).
Today has taken Sunrise in the last month.
In August, Today had an average of 388,000 and Sunrise was 330 000.
In the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40 000 and 50,000 seasons.
So far, during September, the average of Sunrise is 349 000 viewers, when Today has a figure of 314 000.
This is the most interesting event of all time.
The changes will blow in the morning, as in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, ask!

The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800-word series, which contains the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
A new set of dramas, which had a real effect on the average of 1.219 million viewers, tells about the recently widowed father, who will change the New Zealand coast with his two children.
Critics have wondered whether Thomson's popular set of strains is the only force without Rafters-star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real security.
The Seven-channel The X Factor program was found with favorites of 1,136 viewers, easily winning the The Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
The Seven Channel had two fates in the second series of The Chase Australia.
Andrew O'Keefe’s first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new visual system gathered a mean of 44,000 viewers.
Another half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623,000 viewers, which was the only chance of winning from the Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat program (613 000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia's first half-knowledge average of 520,000 viewers, and the second half-knowledge figure was amazing at 70,000.
The average Hot Seat was 620,000.
The fall in the second night's watch mean value in Chase Australia will bring Nine's confidence that Hot Seat will eventually be the most popular show at 5.30 p.m.
The case will replace the Million Dollar Mette program, which failed to track down McGuire's software viewers.

The third one agrees that Sam Wood is the most common type, but who does he choose?
The secret is exposed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may be accidentally exposed, the The Bachelor series.
The woman's identity is extremely hidden, with which Sam Wood comes together in The Bacelor.
The three remaining girls are not really going to play ball, who got the last rose.
However, while discussing with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, one day before the three became two, they may deliberately give a clue as to the identity of the winner.
Sam's lips are sealed before Thursday's finals.
All three of them fell to pieces telling us how Wood is one man, mentioning his sense of humor, emotions, equality and conviction for the reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, when they asked, "If the last rose of the Woods isn't for you, to whom should it go?", their answers might have offered a revelation of who won the son's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski mentioned Mackay as the best way for them to do their job after.
The gap between Mackay and Sam is complicated since the first day of the year.
"From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarahin) and Sam's energies seemed very compatible, and that thought was in my mind all the time," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is really close, it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I'm seeing each other and there's a lot of chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Mackay believes that he and Sam Wood would make a good deal.
Mackay said that last year's home visits made me realize that the course could be "the right one".
"When I saw him with my friends and with my work, I realized that this is obviously not just a game... I'm with my whole heart right now," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose not to, Mackay was a mystery.
"I don't know what to say," she said.
I have as many remaining girls as I can, so it's even between Sneza and Lata.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten channel.

Jarryd Hay has a choice, starting with the NFL track.
Detroit and Seattle were first very excited about him coming to the United States, and many other teams have been asking questions about him since his impressive day of training last year.
However, Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this will make a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayen on the exchange bench for the rest of the game after how this Australian rugbyligan reversed the ball during the first flight to the team to win the Minnesota on Tuesdays of Tuesdays 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted him and allowed Hayne to return the next flight and took him with him after he got hit by the running game Reggie Bus.
The true nature of Tomsula was also seen in the locker room after the game.
Instead of asking for his newcomers to be a pathogen in front of the rest of the team, he worships them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
49 Special Editor Cam Inman reported that Haynea was also encouraged by Thomas McGaughey, the coordinator of the task force, who advised him to forget about the ball he had lost and to play the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flight kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This really wasn't the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans wanted for the NFL debut.
Hayen was seen cursing away from the site after the fall, and then he told the Australian socialist Hamish & Andy about the 2 DayFM channel at a frequency of 104.1 that he would not have been able to imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you just have to think about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his need to his 2007 origin debut when he was feeding his own goal in Queensland.
All in all, it was a great sight for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed his own media account in a photograph of fans holding the flag of Australia.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss the rights of political parties.
In 2003, the most powerful man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested at gunpoint on the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so I was convicted, his company Yukos was imprisoned and his efforts to support democracy were limited.
4th party shooting at rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal.
The human, including a four-year-old boy, died in the south of Nepal, shooting rubber bullets from the police in a mob that protests the new country's proposal for a Constitution, reported on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in the Rupande region of approximately 175 countries west of the capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the top official of the region, said that more than 1000 protesters had been formed outside the public station, and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that he was using tram gas and then he shot into the air before he came into the rubber bullets.
Six cops and five people got hurt, he told me.
It was not quite clear why the rubber bullets known to have killed, but which in the past are used as a less dangerous alternative, seem to have caused so many deaths.
In the last few weeks of violent demonstrations throughout Nepal, the composition was in various parts of the South Poles, where the ethnic question of Madhesi is that the new provinces established in accordance with the new Constitution undermine their strong influence.
There have been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls on its own country.
Since August 10th, there are at least 40 people dying from violent clashes, 11 of whom have been police officers.
On that occasion, the four main parties signed an agreement, which divided the country into provinces - this is a huge new Constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been in the middle of the centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators have been speeding up the process since the devastating earthquake of the poor people.
The legislators have now voted in favour of the Constitution on the terms of Kamandus, and they have said that the new Charter could be adopted by the end of the year.
The NHC of the United States National Circulatory Centre says that the Cape Verde south of Cape Verde accounts for 60% of the total amount of circulatory windstorm.
At a low altitude, about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verde Islands, it is 60% possible to develop for tropical cycles over the next 48 hours, the United States Durban Center reported on Tuesday.
On the other side of the exact low pressure, which lies between the Cape Verde Islands Group and the Small Antilles, there is also a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cycle in the next two days, where the weather forecast centre in which it was located increased.
The aim of this campaign is to launch a donation campaign with a goal of $11,000 for refugees.
The Google Inc (GOGL.O) launched a donation campaign aimed at 11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees who came to Europe to flee from the exodus and the impoverished countries.
Google had an exceptional personal point of view when it published a gift campaign in its blog.
Instead of being informed by the chairman, for his own personal experience, Google's employer, Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul at the age of seven, fled from Kabul with his family.
"Our travels included numerous nights and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, heat and darkness," he said.
I was lucky.
As refugees and immigration in Europe have grown, families and people in Europe are always helping.
Donations will be won by four non-target organisations that help refugees and immigrants: You will try without frontiers, the International Rescue Committee, rescue the refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Asylum.
Google reported that it was equivalent to every donation made worldwide at Google.com/refugeerlief up to $5.5 million, so that the overall target was $11.
Europe is the worst refugee since the Second World War, mainly due to Syria's four years of civil war, which has driven over 4 million people from its homes this year.
Many are also grateful for the war of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Surgery surgery can help slightly thin jobs.
Research has shown that the benefits of a mildly obese type 2 disease can last for at least a period of at least one year.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese issues live longer after weight loss than those treated in other ways.
"It will take a long time to get information on death," Dr. Robin Blackstone says. He is a weight-loss specialist who writes in a new article in JAMA Survey magazine.
In the case of routing, or bariaries, defined methods are used to reduce the size of the lattice.

Over the course of the years, bariatric lesions have been found to be the most effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study have been obese and their BMI (BMI) has been 35 or more.
Bm i.e. the weight ratio to length is considered to be the second when it is between 12.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that one is overweight and if BMI is more than 30, it is considered to be obese.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the purposes of this new research, researchers in the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital (Min-Sheng General Hospital) started using data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery, and gastric depression reduction, type 2 diabetes medication therapy in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut-offs decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the persons who were treated by other means than by reason, BMI remained largely the same.
Twenty-six of the cut persons were cured in full and 28 in part.
For the sake of comparison, in the pharmaceutical-treated group, the total improvement in diabetes was only 1 % and in part about 2 %.
The weight, triglycerides, and the "bad" LDL office "are generally better in the surgical group", the authors noted.
The researchers also followed up on patients with a haemoglobin level of A1c which reflects the long-term level of equality.
The haemoglobin A1c should rise by less than 7 %, according to researchers.
Post-operative haemoglobin level A1c fell from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
This better "glycaemic control", as illustrated by improved haemoglobin levels of A1c, did not reduce mortality over a period of six years, says Chief Researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared average results between two different types of injections.
In the fifth year, when compared to the decreased gastric volume, the gastric bypassed group had shed more weight (18,7 and 14,2 kg), decreased more weights (7,4 and 5.1), decreased more than A1c levels (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent), and was likely to have achieved full control (46,9 per cent and 16.7%).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix's Blackstone says that although it does not seem to exist after six years of survival or surgery, there are research results from research in which more people need to live longer.
In the Swedish investigation, it was found that over the last 15 years, 29% of the excess meat used in the diet was less likely to die in the last 15 years when compared to someone who had tried the most recent techniques.
Even though the new study does not seem to improve the survival of patients with stroke, Blackstone says that the skills are nevertheless encouraging for people with BMI < 35 and who are frustrated with surgery.
"Research results are crucial to demonstrate that the system is safe for the minimum body weight index", and does not entail the risk of death or death," he says.
Blackstone adds that both children and their doctors should be very serious when the BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once man has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to recover.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all the refugees, adding that the present solution to the current refugee crisis can be found in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the countries of origin of the refugees.
Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the beginning of her ten-day visit to Britain.
Dalai Lama claimed that, in the present world, all mankind would come before a single nation or even parts of the earth.
He also stressed that, although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is also insufficient.
"Not everyone can come to a world," he said in his speech.
Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria for their efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is good to take care of several few refugees, but in the meantime we must think about long-term solutions: how to bring true peace and real development to these Muslim countries, through education and training.
The main thing is to figure out how we can stop killing in their countries.
We need to be able to use our power.
Power use has never solved the present," you added.
Having taken a stand on the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the violent response of the United States caused violent events in the chain.
"After 9/11, I gave my condolences to President Bush in a letter and told him that the solution to this problem would go away through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he was powerful and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, children’s ingestion of hand disinfectants has increased by four times ingestion.
In all parts of the United States, there has been an estimated rise of nearly 400% in the ingestion of a highly alcoholic hand-infectant in children under 12 years of age after 2010, reports the Georgian poison information centre.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia’s Intoxication Information Unit, the reported cases of disinfectants in children under 12 years of age reported in the poison centres were reported in 1117 cases in 2010 of 3266 cases in the year 2014 in children under 12 years of age.
"Children are interested in these products more often and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will have to be on-call," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant on purpose, while others try to make a difference or face a problem in their media.
There are videos on YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a bad flood.
According to their work, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic mouth water to get a stronger drink.
The best kind of disinfectants can attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (the ideas) are those that have changed the smell.
There are disinfectants produced by strawberries, grapes and oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain anything between 45 and 95%.
In particular, in small children, only a few sprays are needed for alcohol poisoning.
"It's really solid alcohol," told Fox 4 in Kansas City, Director-General of the United States Institute for Intoxicantology, Stephen Thornton.
So you wouldn't leave a bourbon behind, but the hand-infecting material is left out, and if you're interested in it, it's the best way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhajah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of almonds from hand disinfectants at school and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice as high as the adult’s limit of driving, says an emergency doctor named Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Well, when you were talking about your moustache, he couldn't get away when he got to the next door.
They followed him overnight at a separate home in case of possible brain injuries, as anyone had to die and hit his head, Ritsey said.
"It was really scary," Nashiyah's home Ortora Scott told the CNN.
It could have been a kill for my baby.
It has been recommended that parents and teachers should use alcohol products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are associated with death.
In 2013, two British women died after swallowing hands of disinfectants, which contained toxic, unknown ingredients.
Public health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, not ethyl alcohol, which was identified as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of the state of New York, three fourths planned to poison their "bad" teacher by spreading the bacterial poison to the room, say the report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and has banned it from his class.
We need to prevent the idea of "supervised" and disciplinary action.
Humour: Celtil has no conflict of interest in Celtil.
Giffiths ignores the talk about Celtic's conflicts, and Deila admits that Hoops is in the middle of nowhere, but she can turn it around.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish FYI against Neilson's accusations, and Warburton is on guard for recruitments that may interfere with the team's unity.
Dons set the lead in Celtic at five points.
Adam Rooney's first half penalty rate led Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at Pittodr Stadium and gave the team a chance to find out the difference between Celtic and five points.
Giffiths minimizes talks about conflicts of interest.
There have been rumors about Celt's internal conflicts, but Griffiths immediately passed them, and he claims that he and his teammates have no feeling of working under closer supervision when the team is about to face the President.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship will satisfy the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle-level player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, because there is no competition for the championship with the Rangers.
A little while ago, Mr. de Boer said, "Where no longer is the top of the Celtic game, and why?"
The Powers are not involved.
They're not here to talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old Firm team.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're upset about.
There are a lot of tensions in the teams, as well as non-Scottians want to follow.
But she swears to turn around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn around.
Lose Malmö and the resulting fall from the Masters' team quickly resulted in the loss of nine games by Aberdeen, who is now at the top of the top of the hat at the next point.
But Deila said, "Celt has had bad episodes before, and we're coming back."
Now we just want to get out of this way as soon as possible.
I know that this is an impertinent and that it is very, very angry or sad about what is going to happen.
We are, too, but we have to move on.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
It's important to be together.
Warburton is in reserve for January’s player transfers.
A few months ago, the Rangers-bomb Mark Warburton just commented on the best possible subjects for the Danish online transfer, he is on his watch for the most recruitment, claiming that he does not want to interfere with the team's consensus.
He said, "The transfer of January is very different from the transfer of January."
In the summer for future players, the adjustment period is the whole time that comes into play here.
The team is doing very well.
Increasing unnecessary players can do more harm than that.
Celti's interest in Michu suggests that there is a risk that the Elevator will not be able to survive.
Mr. Michu, the giddy giddy with his name attached to the transfer to Celtic, has suggested that he may retire after his contract with Swans has ended.
A 29-year-old worker has had a vertebral episode for two years, and he was unable to get the news from outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight the Scottish World Trade Organisation against Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team then lost 3-2.
Neilson remains behind his message saying, "I did not question the truth, I did not comment on the performance."
Giffiths swears he wants Tynecastlea.
A stable Hibernian player was reproved to sing a singing song about another Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
This incident took place in a pub in Edinburgh, New York, before the Edinburgh postbya Tynealle at the stadium in July 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a moment's thought," the bomber said, adding, "I think it's safe to say I'm not going back to Tynecastle, but then move on to Celtic."
The government of Tadice believes in the leadership of Dundee Management - Donnelly
Simonnelly claims that the government of Dundee United States still has faith in the leading effort to turn the situation around, but admits that the losing of players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnesfying "sucking off" in Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Acces, but he succeeded in reaching his seventh consecutive hit-and-run with Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty, which raised five points to the top of the table above the Celticia.
McInnes says: "There is no team that would have won anything, whether it was po or not, which would also not win in a way."
Scottish unemployment remains unchanged at the same rate as the United Kingdom's total GDP growth.
EMPLOYMENT In Scotland, the average number of people in the period between 14,000 and the third, while in the United Kingdom as a whole, it stood at 10.000 in total to 1 million.
The Scottish deficit rate is 5.9 per cent higher than that of the United Kingdom at 5.5 per cent, the National Statistical Centre (ONS) figures are pivotal.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 in three months, and the number of employees is now 2 612 000.
In Scotland, the employment rate during the quarter is 74 per cent, which is higher than the average in the United Kingdom, by 7 per cent.
Mr David Mundoll, Secretary of State of Scotland, commented on these latest chapters: "The long-term plan of the Government is to build a basis for a stronger economy."
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made its historic decision to be part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has risen and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I need to make an execution in Oklahoma?
If no formal intervention takes place, I'll see you later today when the man is executed.
If so, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the viewers' camp at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, watching Richard Glossip be executed by a judicial injection.
He is an attempt to be one of the four official witnesses of truth.
In January, I answered through his best friend, and even though I was concerned, I agreed.
I'm beginning to freak out this day as it approaches it.
Why did I agree to why?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death.
That would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, it is possible for contractors to monitor executions in the USA, and since there are often more requests than free places, participants will be selected through horrifying valuation.
Oklahma has reduced the number of places reserved for media to twelve in five.
Whoever chooses will watch it cool.
I can't do it.
Nearest to the nearest friends of Richard Glosip, I have also created my own connection by means of conversations made during the months and by means of a two- and a half-hour visit.
I like him.
We often laugh when we talk.
Prison authorities say that I can't be both a witness and a reporter, so I'm not allowed to have a copy of the book and keep it to myself.
I just need to try to remember all the details.
One of the Oklahoma journalists accused me of knowing that I've been anxious about my impartiality.
This is it. This is it.
I'll put him in prison in a way that I want you to participate in.
I chose the editor.
People say that "it would have been better to do what they say," but they still think that what I do is right.
Richard Glossy has disagreed with some of my messages and articles.
I don't know what I'm going to do, so that's what he said.
I told her that she could always remove me from her tag list at any time.
He wants to see an international reporter who's working on it.
If Glossie dies, he believes that the public will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post's reporter Kim Bellware is right next door to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can copy the podcast missions I made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't quite say that Richard Glosi is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees's theory will in any case ensure that he is helped.
And I believe there is a very strong evidence that he is not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there was no sufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And so this is the perspective from which I look at him dying.
I can't argue that I'm not partial to a party.
There will be other agents who will be concerned about it.
I'll give you a description of what it looks like to watch the man I like die absolutely.
The man was lured away from the Canning River after the watering of the police.
Officer Canning Valen remained dry when he lured a man away from the Canning River River.
The man from Perti got the cops wrong, when he was just a mile from the bottom of his head, but only a few feet from the water, who tried to "slow him back to the bottom".
The Canning Vale police were called on Tuesday to Beckenham for unauthorised entry.
When they discovered the suspect, they tried to mislead them in the direction of the Canning River River.
Not too far.
" stood in the water saying, "I'm not coming, come get me," said First Sergeant Shandell Holddine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he made the best of the tactics: "good negotiations".
"Some people do funny things trying to escape," said the first sergeant.
Ben Cousins is an excellent example.
In 2006, Cosins abandoned his car to blow up and tried to swim across the Swan River River River.
He failed in his firm, but inspires locals to start planning a hostile Ben Cousins bathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the contractors committed an act of spying on him and threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody has argued that the operators in Racing Victoria tried to infiltrate the spy he was still alive last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He is accusing the employees and the Board of Immunity of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign against me.
Mody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the race, and that he has had to deal with the situation since Lidar's explained strong cobra display.
He has kept his tongue in check on spy claims for the past year and year, and you do not want him to look like "it would look like cover".
"I wasn't going to say anything about this, and I've been talking about it for a while, but of course it's going to be so bad that everything goes out once," Moody said.
They knew that the process was going on.
All we need to do is deal with and live with the consequences, and I need to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home and sleep well.
I live my head up and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best in front of them.
When they start thinking differently, I don't think I should go on as a coach anymore.
Then I would have to think about what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody dropped the bomb at the racing.com interview, where he told me that the Department of Freedom had been spying on his stables.
"One and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man asking him to look at him and offered him a job at my disposal if he cared about what I was doing there.
They're clearly looking at me as a cheater.
If it's true, they'd really want to lie about what they're doing, because they've failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware and clear today.
Am I just starting to think that this is going to be personal?
Is Victoria Racing all the more likely to be manned and perhaps to assume responsibility for other than coaching for what is happening in this area?
Am I being harmful to the sector?
Am I that bad for the sector?
That's probably what people think.
I have to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that things I'm about to make us think about it.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, and it saddens me.
It really makes me sad.
I urge them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The cobbits of Lidar have increased because of the cobbits of Lidar, and the late rejection made him realize that he could " throw his license over the table".
Moody, who is best known for his unbeatable training of Master Black Caviar, has called the word "joyable" for day-to-day care after mud or clay sores have been put on the feet of a horse, which is not proper.
'It is against the rule of law.
I have to take the best part of it", he said.
One of my employees put it on the foot by mistake.
It would be a grave.
It could have been that way, just like it was.
That's what it was on baby day.
Modus may face a three-month ban on competition for the search treatment of the day from which the contractors started the investigation.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about it.
"We all understand that there is a need for security, but this is too far gone," Moody said.
A driver who has been arrested in Combram for traffic escape has been arrested.
He's been arrested by a man who's been in traffic escape since he's stuck in a bike in Cobarm.
The cyclists were transported by plane to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after he was seriously injured when the car hit the Murray Valley highway on the morning of the accident.
He found out that the driver drove away and didn't get away from the biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He shall be charged with the death of any accident, for failure to provide assistance and for other traffic offences.
A cyclist, 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and is stable.
Mr. Craig Bellamy, the head coach of the News Sstorm team, will be looking at the rivals in protests against the protests.
Melbourne Storm's coach, Craig Bellamy, has also criticised two NRL-rugbyligan master's preferred claims that his team's tacs are part of the "score".
Sydney Roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that the judges allowed Storm's "pain" on his side when it suddenly won the final draw in Sydney every night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely missed his goal to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on the finals on Saturday night. He called the game Rugbylig "the screenplay" and said that two of the Queensland teams were not "hard-on" games.
Bellamy defended the team's takats and said that they were just talking about "to contact" in the takats.
Bellam added that the record was increased by the two leading coachess against Storm, which means that they are afraid to lose to the team.
"it always comes up - I don't know Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can expect that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or in our entire year. In the last six weeks, we have just stressed contact in our tackles, and it has led us to success.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he clearly has a strong team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, and so this was a shock to him.
It's funny. It's always gonna be fun.
Bellamy challenged Mr. Bennett's idea of "an exciting rugby" to remind his mentor that Mr. Bennett's coach, St. George Illawarra Dragons, won the championship in 2010 in the second year of "welcome".
Wake up with an exciting rugby.
He was supposed to compare the game of the night with our game of the night and tell us how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said that he didn't care much.
But now he's got a team that can match the kind of rugby we find exciting, even when he's got big young friends.
That's the kind of game you always play when you have its type of players.
He brought it up in 2010, now he wants everyone to match his style of rugby - not every team has friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I'll be more confident when they're a little nervous about playing games.
Six months ago they did not drive in opposition to important games.
Bellamy also noted that the game between Stormin and Roossi was more scored than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
Broncos was really a game, I'm not looking at it yet, but what's it done? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it the exciting rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting resort and not make a goal?
For me, this is a matter of rulings.
If they're going to talk us out of it, that means we're going to fight it out.
Storm is free this evening because they have already won a real home game against either the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks in AAMI Park. The tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
For a Serb, 200,000-person bail for a drug charge.
A man who is threatened with a possible life-long death of 40 kg of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has increased against a guarantee amount of 200 000 USD.
The 29-year-old Marko Maksimovic is one of the five men who were arrested last month after the government had charged 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay yacht, which came to South America via Vanuatutan and was trapped in Coomera in late last month.
Makimovic was seen seeing other accused persons at the port of the port the whole time, and then he met him at a coffee shop in Coomera Road House, where he found 40 kilos of drugs from the Toyoto Eco car.
With regard to the holding company of the amount of cocaine intended for the business, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovica is trying to hold the entire amount and that he may be on the list for completely innocent reasons.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovov was trying to escape.
"he has a fixed connection to Taiwan.
She travels frequently," she told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Makimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and spouse together had offered 200 000-dollar guarantee amounts to ensure that he was bailed out.
"After reading the voluntary evidence of both parties, it is clear that setting a guarantee amount of 200,000 dollars is a real burden," said Judge Flanagan.
In fact, it was not enough to prevent a man from not necessarily being in justice, he was right.
Guarantees were granted to Maximovic on condition that he gives up his Australian and Serbian passports, informs him every day and holds on to the ban on the movement between the six and the six o’clock.
Stevan Hogg was on the phone to attract pedigrees to send a picture of him.
The patient used photos of child abuse when asked for a call from a 11-year-old.
Stevan Hogg was sleeping on this side of the house and then logged in to an electronic service where Hogg received a number of rude pictures of children who were sent by another user to him.
came up later, and the phone was gone and found it lying at Hogg's hand.
Check his computer and find out what was going on, and then he immediately told me about it.
On arriving, the police saw five pictures, examined the computers present and found "sustainable" web-searching using the search for children's immoral images.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to seduce the beasts" in the press before he "played a game to scare them".
Fiscal depute representative Eilidh Robertson told the Dandeen Sheriff's Court of Justice: "He said that this is an addiction - he is dependent on scaring people.
He explained that he had made a search on his computer and said that they were only made because he wanted to pretend to be drunk so that he could scare the pedillos.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures, as well as about how Hogg sent more photos.
Hogg said that I just did it for bait purposes.
She said that she was getting sick after she got drunk, and she was looking for pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: "When a girl found pictures of her house, she screamed at her mother, shaking and crying.
My mother saw the illegitimate pictures on the phone and then faced the charge.
He was interviewed, and he told me that the accused had a computer and a Playstation to talk to the girls who looked like he was the boss.
The 23-year-old Hogg on Ward Road, who was in Dundea, found guilty of making or taking pictures of immoral children on the 14th day of June last year. He probably broke his hand on the day of June this year and would not be brought to trial on 24th of June this year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg be entered in the register of a mutual criminal record, as it can be argued that his crimes were not "a significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal suspended the sentence so that social security has time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was given bail in this case, but in the ongoing cases, he is under arrest before taking a stand.
They were added to the criminal record before the date of the trial.
Simon Robert Mugabe said the right thing to say to Parliament.
The oldest leader of Africa Mugabe fell earlier this year at the steps leading up to the spokesperson's height.
He did not get hurt, but the video of the fall spread like a virus in the media.
Parliament's openings were also inspired by opposition legislators' arguments that they had been sent an anonymous warning of the threat to Mugabe during his speech.
All month long, they were bouncing and interrupting him in the middle of the intermission on the ground talking to Parliament - what he said on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) United States Police Inspector Innocent Gonese said that seven opponents had received text messages from seven opponents who were cautioning them to change Mugabe's speech.
"The number of messages sent from which the message is sent does not answer, but the main message is 'death', Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warned about the end of immunity to Parliament, and when they come out, the formal immunity is not valid.
The criminal administrator said that the party leading Morgan Tsvangirai has "supervised" claims against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is up to 30 000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the business of business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printing business from the growing business and services of the company more rapidly.
The expected jobs will bring about USD 2.7 billion from the fourth to fourth, as announced by HP.
"These redeployments will allow a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," says Meg Whitman, President of the HP and CEO, who will be responsible for the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the present-day-HP, and we will have a wide and profound range of services that will help companies to move on to a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to ask about the needs of our global customers is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover will be more than $50 billion, and it "concentrates on the basis of an uncomprehensive set of integrated technologies", reports the company's information.
The division will break up the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, graduated from the University of Stanford, founded in the 1930s to produce electricity.
HP has gone through a huge transformation to find out about the transition from traditional computer to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology groups in the United States, and its decomposition is the latest in the field, based on the belief that rapidly-defined companies are performing better.
Captain Mikel Arteta of Arsenal says that teammates must be helped by the injured Jack Wilshere before the Dinamo Zagreb game.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that now it is just a matter of time before and assuming that his rehabilitation is going as planned, there is no reason why he would not be back on his way to work.
At best, in this case, Worldshirle will play at least the next four games, and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will be participating in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity in this recent situation is that the end of the last month of Wilshene was one of the last more dim things, and he remembered his long-term existence in the day after the beginning of the day.
"This kind of disability does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's the one that didn't get it right.
It's nothing strange.
It was just a stakeout.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries that he's had.
This can be true from a medical point of view, but, as with Wenger, there is a risk of further injuries while trying.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern in shape.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilshe has had 23 different injuries since she was deby.
In addition, during the last six months, he has only played 65 games for Arsenal 157 games in the last six months.
For Arsenal's widest overall period since 2007-08, in six out of eight, it has been one of some of the Valioliga's teams, which has lost all the days due to the injury.
Wenger will give a chance, but Arsenal believes that their last-day improvement to the injury will be examined.
"As soon as you arrive from the injury may be an exposed period," Wenger said.
Jack is old enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will be strengthened, I am sure that it will, and that he will be able to do what he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to regroup his team when Arsenal starts his Masters League game on Wednesday nights against Dinamo Zagreb, playing after yesterday against Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Mr Bellerín and Mr Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also replace Kieran Goroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott with Kieran Goroud.
"I'm trying to balance and give a break to players who need it," Wenger said.
Even though Arsenal is a clear follow-up to the F block, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not disappeared in 41 matches since they brought in their own "Inviolable" campaign last month.
The oil was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, which had a power of 3.2 at the 42-point scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal is now aware of the surrender of the League of Masters against Monaco in recent years, and he is still motivated by a far-flung dream of a team leading to its new victory of the European Cup.
"This motivation is enormous," Wenger said.
Arsenal is not.
We're very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about man-to-man friendship.
It is remarkable how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given that the power to open up is more than ever, and higher than fifteen years.
In 2013, the biggest cause of death was in men aged 20-45 years in the United Kingdom, and it is three times more common in women than in women.
The aim of the project was to challenge the language that would prevent a man from applying for help in the event of a crisis.
At the heart of this challenge, friendship is at the heart of this challenge.
In the recent study, more than 2,000 upper and upper secondary school students showed symptoms of depression. According to the study, the chance to recover doubled, if a high percentage of her loved one was "welcome".
For those who were not depressed, the likelihood of mental health problems occurring was halved if you were mentally healthy.
To make an effort to act, it must be available at all times.
In this time of communication through social media, the course is over, and the lack of immediateness is often more important than a question.
Our working lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, even though there is actually a separation rule.
This kind of success is governed by the values that the psychologists call external: money, image, status. All of this happens at the expense of internal values - the inner desire for personal growth and innovation - at the expense of our deeper mental health.
And as the surveyer video gamemaker explained, money really does not get more happiness.
The precision of the identifiers was precisely that it turned this focus on its head.
No character changed their work, but rather their personality, which clearly differed in interaction.
The numerous hugs of Joey and Chandler, while at some comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - these rumors came to me knowing that yes, they can match all of this, even though they often hesitate to explore their feelings completely.
As Samaritans volunteer worker explained to me: ..."As I listened to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can help to make them feel better."
Often, the men of contact with us try not to talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as does the feeling that if you open up to problems, we'll see you as weak.
Identifiers are one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer you the most recent means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of statistics between them.
Although unbiased, my external position in the inside at a different end will help people at the moment, long support comes from a close, personal study and a network of friends.
So if you're going to join Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the shooting places are over for the night, why don't you just take me to Central Perk?
Or, better yet, if you see Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much you can find out.
Dates will be sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end, all of the 236 episodes, to participate in #FriendsFest.
Di Maria is going to score and help P.G. put Malmo on the side of the page.
Angel Di Maria will celebrate with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria made the goal of the Masters League in her debut, helping PSG pass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Downstairs report and shoots to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the right direction when Paris Saint-Germain started the Masters League game, of course, with a nice 2-0 win against Malmö in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
In his debut at the Masters League, Di made a goal for less than four minutes to show the French league champions the way, but the team bailed out several times before they further increased their distance during the Cavan strike in the 61st.
Paris, which is in the same A-block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, had a strong start against the Swedish Champion, for there was not only a place to go, but also an improvement in the games leading to their quarter finals in the last three rounds.
But even if PSG scored, it wasn't a classic game, for Laurent Blanci's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost his job in front of the game and later on. Malmö is his old hometown team and that team where he started his career in the first year.
"The league of the masters is not easy to play at home or at guests, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for the opponent and looks at the statistics, and it's okay.
This is good for you.
We want to win and win, even though I wonder if we did not succeed in doing one or two more things.
Ibrahimovic returned to the couple's team after one of the three changes made after the game was played on 2-2-game in the Lgue 1 home game against Bordaux, but he was in the fourth minute behind Di Maria.
When he moved from Manchester to New York last month, the Argentinian foreign minister was named the one who took the PSG to a new place in Europe, and he proved himself when he ran Marco Verratt's pitch behind the Malmo's front line and then hit the back of the network with a great finish through Johan Wiland.
However, if anyone expected the easy and heavy defeat of PG, he would have been disappointed.
Malmö was a two-way opponent, and he won Celtic's final match at this level, with nine fourth players and five-man defense and two players in the middle.
The team offered nothing more than a shot at Nikola Djurdjis in the 34th minute, which went by the button from Kevin Tapp's goal stick.
On the other hand, the PSG sometimes got in trouble because of lost feeds and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovović, which failed in all four only during the first half and after Cavani put the ball in the first half of the second half of the day when Ibrahimovic was in contact with him.
However, he was much more effective at doing the first work for his colleagues, and it was just from the feed of Ibrahimovov that Di Maria sent a detour that hit Wiland's paintball in the 52nd century.
The second goal was won after a ten-hour game, thanks to the American Cavani, who hit his sixth goal, after Ibrahimovic had pushed forward at Maxwell's cross-breed.
That's why Malmö's hopes of getting back to the game, and only the great fight against Wiland's David Luiz for the direct kickout were held down before the change came to the end of the game, the goal of the Izequiel Lavezzi was rejected at the end of the game.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later found that PSG was as high as his team. Normal said: "The latest Masters League game was last year in December."
Since then, all we've been doing is playing for Sweden, which isn't the same.
It's not enough to try out. It's not enough.
The hat's all over it.
This was a great game they played.
Glencore is the equivalent of $2.5 billion in shares for sale.
Glencore, who was involved in the price collapse of basic goods, collected on Wednesday $2,2 billion in shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, who was listed on the London Stock Exchange, announced in a notice that it had sold new shares for some £1.6 billion to be deducted from its debt.
A company that lost 57 % of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of the collapsing essential goods, when the economic slowdown in the PRC is causing demand and fills everything on the market.
The new mark increased Glencore's share value to the top of the London Stock Exchange in the mid-week quarter.

The company sold 1.3 billion shares worth of 9,99% of the total.
Concerns about the long-standing growth in China have cut iron prices around the same time that prices for coal, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20 to 40 %.
The house will set up Xi Jining's visit to Vietnam.
President of the Republic of the United States of America, President of the Republic of Xi Jinping, announced in the opinion of the Second House on Tuesday, at the end of the month.
The first visit to Washington by Xin will take place on 25 September and is open to President Barack Obama last November to visit Beijing, which was stated in the opinion.

Matt Dam is a little different in filmmaking.
Matt Damon came together with the African American figure Effie Brown when he talked about the difference that Damon said he didn't need behind the scenes.
In HBO's Sunday evening Project Greenlight, an actor who had been involved in the project interrupted Mr. Oliver's emphasis on the different aspects of the need for a dark head of the selected project script.
"When we talk about the difference, taking into account the choice of actors in film, not in two," Damon concluded.
Stunned Brown reacted with unbelievably, with comments "Oh! Wow. Okay", while the comments of the actor The Martian remained in the air.
The other producers, Ben Affleck and Farrelly's teams, were involved in a series of finalists in Damon and Brown.
"I want people to think, no matter who the director is, how they treat Harmon's human beings," said Brown.
The darkest character is the whore that his mate beats.
The author of The Dear White People called for the right to film guidance for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was determined "to give us something we don't want".
After the discussion had been sent, the media exploded in protest of Damon's comments.
"Matt Damon talking about the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is such a light that happens."
After publication, the copy collected more than 5,000 retwelfths and 4,000 pcs.
Damon's comments point to a time when a thorough racial presentation in the media is in the context of social dialogue.
After a white man takes out a teenage Michael Brown in 2014, the recent Lives Matter movement became widespread and called on the legislators to stop dissatisfactioning people and to stop colourful practices.
In February, singer Prince referred to the publication when he presented his album candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
As with books and black lives, albums still matter.
The presidents of the Black Insembeck movement have recently submitted an opinion on the question of whether a group should be considered to be an angry group, in response to the opinion of Fox News's growth, Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a team," the presidents said.
It was never said that Damon was part of the group of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the pope in the west of the image of the Catholic Church.
It is not clear whether he made a call or had already met the pope.
The first Ninja Warrior in America to be crowned the first Ninja Warrior.
On Monday, Isac Caldiero, a professional practitioner and collector, became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warnior contest and won a dozen prizes.
In the 7th period of the finalisation of the competition programme, there has never been a competitor who would have survived all the steps taken by the race track.
In the last period of the series, two men, Caldiero, and Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task was to climb about a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time, which made him the first athlete of all time, who solved the exhausting 4th part of the American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero found out the challenge three-thirds of what made you the winner.
Caldiero interviewed E!News after the victory he had won and was still in shock for winning a million dollars.
"That's what this is all about, when I've never known or lived more than 10,000 dollars a year," Isaac told E! after a big raise in wages.
So suddenly... so I can't even imagine what it's gonna be like... the future is unknown.
Kent Weed, Director-General of Education, was sitting in the UK with The Hollywood Reporter in print and why Britten won't receive more cash, even though he's the first competitor of all time who's managed to cross the track.
According to the rules, the money goes to the highest person.
"If more than one person passes, the money gets the one with the right time," Weed said.
Life is the true reward and change, but he gets a great feeling.
I don't think he's gonna feel the same way about it.
He's just so sure that he's done what he's done.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great father and a good father.
He's the father of his mother and his wife.
I was like, "If anyone had to help me, I'm afraid it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would be the same, if this were the other way around.
The American Ninja Warrior will return to the eighth period, which will start in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers climbed by Minnesota past Twins.
MINEPOLIS -- The second half of the season has not been much fun for Detoit Tigers.
Tigers was at first one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last in the American League Central.
Tiggers played a perfect role in the game on Tuesday, when he won the win at the Twins 5-4 Target Field in Minnesota.
Twins refused to be able to get up in the middle of the Houston Astros in a race from another wild card in the American League.
The game for Detroit was for at least one night to go back to the second-lettered H-word, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the latest half of the season.
"All odds are fun, no matter how they get," said Team Leader Brad Ausmus of the Tigers team.
Tigers feeder Alfredo Simon continued to warn about his attack aid when Detroit ran three times in the second row, and then on the fourth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) feeds 6 1/3 in the ratio and lets three runs run.
This was only his third quality start in the last nine games.
"I just want a strong end for the next year," Simon said.
There's a chance for the changer to play what game he plays, and I want to go deep into the game.
Tigers' replacement, Vi Martinez, hit three times and set up two runs, which were his first hits running after the mid-term of August.
This was Martinez's first three strokes in the afternoon after he hit Seattle Marines four times on 6 July.
"He's got a good taste", Ausmus said.
He looked good (in practice), seemed to be much better at training and continued to do the same in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the last half of the seventh interval, and it was their best chance of getting into the game.
The Center Byron Buxton began by hitting the test at the left of the field.
On the right-hand side, Aaron Hicks was housed in one shot, and Simon got burned directly by another gamer Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced by the left-hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player against him, the pre-starting deputy Miguel Word, who pulled two runs to the left of the right hand Drew VerHagen.
With two runners on the field and a smooth runner in two-spee, VerHagen got a three-pee in the lead position for double-playing game with Trevor Plouffen.
It was a major record: 27 times in this month, when Plouffe hit double-time.
After Detroit had received a confirmation run at the ninth start, Mauer called out two hit-and-runs against the Tigs' closureer, Bruce Rondoni, and had 5-4.
However, the second player burned the Inde in three feeds with his fifth life.
Detroit used the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers got three runs in the first round against a right-handed veteran who got away from the game before the game was taken away for over a month because of the lower leg infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to do this at the beginning," Hughes said, "but while I was in the game, I was more comfortable, and I knew that I had to make a couple of nice baits on the next shift."
After Hughes caught a beginner on the first pole, he gave another lead player, Ian Kinsler, at the same time.
On the right side of J.D. Martinez's change of two pieces brought together Victor Martinez, who spent the first run of the game with an average pitch of 1st and a game on the right.
Victorez cut off his 0-21 tubes while running in good running condition.
The third game player Nick Castellanos went on to hit the right and take another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected trying to get to the third base.
Tigers continued on the other side and received one piece, two heads on the run from James McCann and two pieces, one on the run from centrifuge Anthony Gol, followed by 3-0 on the situation.
"It was an important shot," said the Team President of Twins, Paul Molitor.
He didn't do very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the input readings and fed me the second time, after which he was replaced by a right-hand co-founder, A.J. Achter.
Three runs were calculated for Hughes for six hits and four moves.
NOTE: Tiger's right-wing player, Anibal Sanchez Street, throws away his right-hand head for a Russian ride.
He is studied by Dr. James Andrews, who cut Sanchez's head in 2007.
Sanchez has been injured since mid-midways due to an attic, but he was supposed to be here on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out, left-handed leader Daniel Norris will be injured from the start against Twins.
Noris statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four readings after the left-handed pitcher David Price was replaced on 30 July.
Norris has been out since 2:00 due to the right distension of the muscle.
Tigers and Twins three games on Wednesday in Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.3 ERA) stands up against the right-hand pitcher of Gossota Ervin Santanaa (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges the global economy to become more competitive in all parts of the world.
The economy will open up more to the world for growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, to direct the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing reform policies", he said, in talking about deepening the reform at 16th meeting.
Supporting transparency while driving forward reforms to increase new movement and vitality, and creating a new state of renewal, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access, a lack of transparency of border inspection principles, a call on state-owned enterprises to take on private capital, and a revision of the housing registration system.
According to the law, a second set of lists will be created to identify sectors and enterprises that cannot be invested in.
It will be tested by means of pilot projects and will be best tested by means of pilot projects.
The change must be noted, since it will make the market more attractive in terms of alignment, ensure a legal environment and make the market more accessible, as set out in the opinion.
The government will also loosen its control to the power it distributes to companies, thus ensuring that the companies themselves decide how you manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China would allow border regions to explore new cross-border models of economic cooperation and develop new ways of developing regional growth.
More sectors are being opened up to private financial institutions when the general government's public sector is replaced.
"The government does not change its policy on foreign investment, and it will protect the legal interests of foreign finance companies and provide better services", the opinion stated.
In addition, the search process for foreign permanent residence permits, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising standards and facilitating the search process.
The meeting also discussed the protection of the right to work of lawyers and the promotion of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and the presidents Liu Yunsha and Zhang Gaoli, who took part in the meeting, were discussed in the following opinion:
