Eli Kouki asked Hurricane for a home profit opening - another victory for Savo Volley.
Back to the seven-time online game at the Championship League medals was Hurrigani-Loimaa’s first season of 2018-19 home racing when Raision Loimu crashed on Saturday 3-0.
Emili Kouki, who returned to Finland from Romania, was the 22nd most important player in the Hugrikan.
There were some bugs in the field, but they didn't come back, and then there was a call from Loimaa.
We got a quick run at it, Kooki said.
Like in Loimu, Tomi Rumpuen’s support at 18 points was played in Kouki.
The most important activity of the guests was the game of the playing national teamaklu Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
The winning of the slot game is always important.
A number of players also had experience on the other side, and it brought an additional exam.
Our game is not finished yet, but the end of the medal pipe is, of course, Kokii said.
Mätän Savo Volley's most powerful.
Miro Mätänen was 18 points in Savo Volley's most important part when the team knocked down the Vantan Ducks 3-0 next door.
Our game was clever, even at the head of the attack, but fortunately, we were able to press for victory.
There was at least no known download when I played against my new team, Mätä.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3rd round of years 2000-01, scored 12 points.
Headmaster Jokka Tutvinen was pleased about a number of things.
Halli was a feeling all over the place.
The file was left behind for home assistance.
Miro was a king, each played a good game, Importer said.
Siltal's last season was 2006-07, then he won silver at Pielaveden Sammo in that time as head coach at that time.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks at the top of 14 points.
Mikko's new star of Akaka-Poly.
Joni Mikkonen, who won the 2012-13 league point exchange, has also started this season very strongly.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Aaka-Voly's first season of opening victory after the fall of Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
Your period has started quite well on your own.
Of course, today was close, for we were the fourth losing on 17-21.
We knew about the final score, and the fifth one came in at the same time, Mikkonen said.
The other day in the final quarter of the month, the most important one was the 28 points made by Edvarts Buitids.
Maman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs keskus 17 points.
There wasn't much to do with this guy's hack, Mikkonen lauu.
In the human life of the world as a whole, the human being is a unit of the world.
The world is at the forefront of human life, reports Lancet.
In this study, the most recent development of human life since 1990 was 8.
Over the course of the year, there was a convergence between the countries of the country and the country.
In both years, Finland was a statistical unit.
In 2016, the next autumn was the same as in 1990.
In most cases, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was located one higher, and instead of Canada, it was found in the back of the country.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst in comparison.
Human capital is measured in terms of the general public, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The world’s global economy has been linked to economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletto under control, the spot ended with no paint.
Real Madrid goaltender Zibautouis took over the grand prizes, and the local game of the Madridic teams ended at a low level last Saturday in the football league in England.
Atletico from Madrid Antoine Grizman and Diego Costa were the closest to the goal, but the Belgian guard was to fight against him.
He played in Atletio three times while he was at the Chelsa.
At the beginning of the week, the European Union Fifa took him to the goal of the year.
The best destination in realis was Gaeth Bale, but his shot passed by at the end of the goal opening party.
Balle remains late for a break due to travel injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real's supporters called for the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, the cactus that went to Juvey.
Now we are attacking the right to abortion - The current document explains why.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out if nine of the nine Supreme Court members could be elected by President Donald Trumpin to become Brett Davanaugh.
In the Republic, many wish that the decisive vote of Ikanaugh could reverse the decision known as Roe v Wade, which was adopted in the United States of America on abortion law in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reverse Roe - United States and abortion rights tell you how the current situation has become.
As incredible as it may be, the subject is also present in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and received various levels of support from the majority of the national representatives of our country.
At the beginning of this current document, we will meet together with McNicolas, who has remained the only doctor in Missouri in the United States for the last time since the laws were tightened.
The Klinic armed guard says he defends the freedom of religion of the United States.
The news reminds me of the killings committed to drug abuses.
Let's move on to the time when the abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Assembly of ecclesiastical officers took the lead in bringing women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasons of the pastor being examined are good, but, in fact, they don't really matter yet, a picture of the woman who died of the abortion herself is enough.
Deaths were in the United States for about 5,000 years.
The legalisation of abortions defends the defence of abortions, especially the Republican Party.
As early as 1967, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law in California.
Later, in its presidential campaign 1980, Reagan, in fact, is in the process of mixing religion with the voters of politics.
His abortion was also heard by George Bush, his successor.
And so did Donald Trump.
At the bottom of the matter, the document seeks to find the basis for the politicisation of the abortion case.
When tax exemption was denied to religious organisations in support of racial discrimination, they became politically active.
An abortion was selected for the month.
Religion has brought extraordinary political nodes.
In this article, there is a situation in the United States in which the President, who has held up the voices of the religious authority in the field of abortion, has elected the highest candidate, Mr. Rännaugh, who is now being accused of sexual harassment by many people.
Avaugh may have the power to decide on the rights of 1 million women and women of the United States of America.
The army was shot by seven Palestinians, including two children at the border by large demonstrations.
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year when Israel has fired protesters in the border area.
In one of the seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reports.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Education, two children are among the dead: 12 and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 555 people have been injured.
These were damaged by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and struck an air strike to the border area when the protestors threw up Israel with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has begun to use force to ensure that protesters do not break down the border fence or seek to the other side of it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza since April, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
The wounded are 12 000 according to the United Nations Human Rights Council.
The thinkers call for the access of the Palestinian families to the regions from which the Palestinians left when the State of the Land was founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed an Israeli soldier.
Explosives from the Palestinian side of the planets of kites and helium balls have set fire to forests and agricultural land in Israel.
The Teemu Santa was looking for a police officer who didn't try to shoot himself.
Wigan's partner, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have knocked him out behind him by making a statement in a police area.
The referee Gavin Ward's run.
According to his understanding, the resisting was clear.
The teamu Santa could not believe in any other way.
I think we were in trouble with Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to 85 minutes when Santa fell.
Ward showed me a little bit of discipline, and Mario Vrancic threw the 1-0 win.
He's done five goals for Norwich in the Championships.
Last night, QPR was born in a manner that was elegantly created against the chest muscles.
The work was again similar to that of Puki.
After losing the fire, he went all the way to the end.
He created goals and defence without exception.
To Norwich, the fight was five in two weeks.
The team is running in a league cup.
There are five win pipes behind the back.
The help service for the pedigree population was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland, about 40 000 people are interested in children.
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small majority of women experience at least a certain amount of sexual interest in their etiquettes.
This means about 40,000 people.
Children or young people who are sexually concerned have so far been unable to get help.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Care Support Foundation and Sexpon trains professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and to help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was discussed in the spring, an e-mail flood and meeting times were set out very quickly at the Sexpo for advice and therapy, Yle says.
However, these will be promised by the end of the day.
The sexual preference of many causes confusion.
Most of the paedophile feelings themselves have not done anything about their fantasy and thus did nothing about it.
However, the opinion is generally a permanent feature, however.
Most people hope to get rid of those thoughts that question them and upset them.
They also make it difficult for normal life, tells the above sex-rapist Patricia Thesleff, who acts as a special expert in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if any child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Are the leaders of the choirs or the congolian gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may seem to be missing, but Trump is one of the biggest prize winners on the basis of betting factors.
He has Trump's role in making North Korea at least at the level of speech to engage in nuclear seismic engagement.
The most popular peace for Nobel recipients are the coincidences of President of South Korea, Moo Jae-in and President of North Korea, Kim Jong-in, who have met three times this year and have promised to seek peace between their countries.
Warming between the poles is significant, while last year was still a long time in between.
Nevertheless, the awarding of the existing Kim by many nuclear weapons to and from the country would also help to make a difference.
Nobel Prize winners will be made public since Monday, and the next one will be the most significant, i.e. the peace prize.
The award will not be awarded to participants in the Korean Peninsula Diploma, is one of the most prominent Congolese physicians, Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has handled thousands of women and has risen to be a leading expert in his field in the Congolese Republic.
Mukwege has at work called attention to sexual violence, which is the pervasive sideline of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been appointed to the United Nations Refugee Organisation, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in the years 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has told us that this year there will be 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates shall not be disclosed to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel found out.
In May, the editor asked him in the House if he would ask for peace in his mind.
Everybody thinks so, but I wouldn't say so, Trump said so.
I want to get this done.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the future continued referring to North Korea negotiations.
However, there are issues that make Trumbin Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often acknowledged the people and organizations representing liberal democracy and a multi-day world - just the kind of cooperation that Trump has seen as opposed to.
In the 21st century, three American politicians, all of whom have been democracies: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Thus, the award of a Trums prize would require an ideological translation of the Nobel Committee's ideology.
Fire report in the tunnel: Carers went like sophisticators and drove backwards.
The traffic chaos at the Lohja unit occurred on 8 September.
Regional traffic was reported for both Turku and Helsinki.
When it became clear that this is a system, the combustion plant is trying to bring the traffic back to normal.
However, it did not succeed very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Traffic Centre said that it could not be opened, because there are car drivers in the road with so many people and they're driving how it happens, on the way Mr. Mayor Pasi Käiläinen told STT about his newest STT at the time.
At that time, the highway was set off to drive even in one direction after just a moment of waiting.
When the first one goes against the rules on transport, some others often follow, the head of the traffic security contact, Mr. Tapio Heiskanen, is stunned.
According to the rules of traffic, motorways and tunnels must not be evicted but for the same reason.
Transport security reminds us that, in exceptional circumstances, traffic cannot be left to take place by means of centralised solutions.
The alarms must always be accessible to all alarms.
Going the opposite way on the highway is very much forbidden, as is doing a U-turn and cancelling.
The same prohibitions also apply in tunnels, where the headlamps must always be switched on.
There is a ban, as of course, on parking, on the grounds that there is a clear reason to be forced to do so.
Recently, there have been even cases where the driver has entered the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the right place and the time for that operation," Heiskanen says in the Transport Security Information.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue fighting even if they had caught the ship on the lake bottom.
The Ilves fans carried by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere would have liked to have stayed on the boat for a victory party, even though the ship had been caught at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the head of the ship at the time of the event.
M/Stä, who had been away from the town of Hämeentown to Tampere, got off his route at any time at any time and got caught up in the old water in Akaka.
19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was hurt in a buddy.
The Ilves fans would have liked to continue their trip on the ship until then, but of course it was the second time to send them to the port of the firehouse and at home, Sirjä told STA.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna following the battle between Ilves and HPK, which ended in Ilves 4 win.
According to sex, it was because of the fact that the water surface in the old water was about half lower than usual.
Also, the fact that the nearest sign was covered with locusts also made navigation more difficult, which is why the reflectors didn't normally appear in the dark end of the night.
No more significant discussion.
This guy happened on the west side of the narrow Jumusessalmi shortly after the sea route had been hit by the bridge between the main and the engine bridge in  every year.
There was no greater drama in this case, as the speed of the ship was well at the moment, and the impact on the ground did not lead to a more relevant situation.
According to the sex, getting caught up in the bottom has not caused any leakages of the ship, and the weights of the vessel, and the cruises of the main fish are normally not repeated.
On Saturday morning, the diver went to check on the ship before the ship started to towing off the pebble.
For the sake of certainty, we are still going to the shipyard to make sure that no harm has been done, Pirja says.
The lemur believes that the next tour of M/S Stuen next weekend can be arranged in an orderly manner.
The ship will be twice as long as it is independent.
No use in ambulances.
The rescue unit received an alert from the incident on Saturday night just after 12 and a half.
A hundred alerts were given to the outpatients to receive evacuated travellers, but there was no use for the outpatients.
On the day, Mr. Fireman Matti Willman told me late at night that the conditions of escape at the lake were difficult because of the darkness and the current wind.
The official rescue service reported at half-three o’clock on the other night that all ships on board have been evacuated and that the passengers are moved to the bus and coach.
The cross-sectional surplus built in 1957 is formerly established in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The Trumpic judge, accused of having a hard time and drinking, may miss a high-level job.
Mr Brett Kavanaugh, Judge of the Supreme Court, may well be absent from the post he intends to pursue, assessed by the Executive Director, Mika Aalto, from the Institute of the Commonwealth.
So far, at least three countries have accused Inäugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
In fact, the suspicions have put so much pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump can end up in office for someone else.
In the United States, at some point in the past, it has happened that the President's fourth Supreme Court has created conflicts of interest.
In general, the second date is self-driving, says La La La.
This is what the President has been able to find out about.
The appointment would rain in the camp of democracy.
While the Supreme Court seeks to be a political person, at least in the case of Ivanaugh, a new judge's election has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Vavanaugh is appointed, it is likely that a decision will be made in the Democrat camp in the forthcoming elections in the United States.
It would help to vote for young people and women who would most likely vote for democracies.
Another conservative judge's name at the highest would be a long-term victory for Republicans.
The opportunity to appoint a president cannot be seen, for in the United States, the Supreme Courts are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have recently retired at about 70-80 years of age.
Even in the Republics, some of them hesitate to name the name.
The Supreme Court judges are usually subject to a background check, Ms. Häla.
However, if Trump has given an additional study of the U.S.A. only a week's notice, it can, according to the absolutes, bring something relevant to it.
It'll be fine.
I mean, there's definitely nothing without a clue, I mean, it's all right, it's all right.
It is certainly certain, at least, that Mr Kavanaugh's suitability or impossibility is still being discussed actively before he makes his decision.
The Republics have a majority in the Republics, with 51-49 votes in favour, but at least a two-sided Republican Republican is suspected to be sceptical about the name of Avanaugh.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the title would be put to the vote and the Republicans would disappear.
A woman identified Salisbury as a suspect in military intelligence as an agent.
The Russian woman has been informed by the broadcaster BBC that she has identified Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service as a suspect in the poisoning of the suspect.
On the basis of the photographs, the woman told me that this was a military inquiry with Anatoli Chepiga, a member of the Group.
Nettingcats and Insider Russia earlier reported that they had reported another intoxication of suspicious men in Chepiga.
In the past, they already said at their disposal that the existing identities are covert personnel.
The BBC group traveled to a village near the Far East in which the Chepiga grew up on the border between Poland and the Far East.
A nearby woman recognized a young Chepigan Bellingcat from the images published by her.
He sensed the same British police picture of a man now calling Ruslan Boshiro.
Russian men are suspected of being poisoned by the same co-agent, Sergei Skripal, and his head in the late months of Noveshok's nervous system.
Scriples survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, by the Russian National Guard in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected Gru connection.
The men suspected of poisoning earlier told the Russian TV about their interview with Salisbury as tourists.
The elderly are throwing their way through the sot-renewal process.
Here is an example of what the change of the war reform of the Sipilä government really means.
My municipality Vaala’s sote services are provided by the Oulunkaari community, whose health service manager has been selected in 2016 by the former Regional Director of Iländo.
The leaders of the community are threatening the delegation for the changer.
If the war goes up now, the state aid will be cut in the future.
When the central headquarters were startled, and most of them are now in the process of a major restructuring of the care of the elderly, which would end up in the health centre the department of the year and the unit of small memory hospitals.
More home care, which means long distances in Vaala, means that older people living in an outlying village were basically "home" treated next to the health centre.
Annando trusted that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left-wing left-wing committee did not suffer from bad preparation, but organised a public conference, which became many of its own, immediate nurses, as well as other parties' councillors.
I've been working on the sote county preparation, how the old people in Vaala are currently being treated most of the time in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
There was also the town councilman Carina West.
Some newspaper did a big deal about the event, and it raised the Oulkaari manufacturers back to normal.
Soviet manufacturers do not write on any paper that Löndo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is currently waiting for all the residents.
There is no other supplier of services.
Manufacturers are only talking about service receipts, but they do not tell us what level of care it gets or what kind of staff structure the Lündo will take care of the elderly until they receive access care.
A nurse?
In fact, health centres are being stopped because there is not exactly a stroke.
Lándo will contact doctors at Vaala’s health centre.
This is an example of the lack of information and the lack of change in the role of central officials.
This way, the center will clear out the inhabitants of Vaala, who will stay safe there on a voluntary basis, if there is anything else.
Is there one vote in the centre that the whole country is considered to be inhabited?
President Erdogan opened a major-mosketeer in Cologne.
In the city of Cologne in Germany, thousands of people express their minds when the visiting president of the country, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the Rhine River since the beginning of January.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the protesters in the sides, and the slogans protested fascism.
Several demonstrations have taken place during the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, and the security has been severe.
Some 10,000 people were expected to protest the human rights situation in Turkey, among other things.
Erdogan's supporters had also been gathered in the vicinity of the Moskeja.
However, the police had isolated the area from the environment for safety reasons.
In his open speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and assessed it for strengthening relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdoga's meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkelin again.
Erdogan and Merkel swore once again that they would rebuild their relations with countries, which have deteriorated considerably since next year's 2016 coup d'état.
However, it was pointed out that there are deep differences between countries in terms of, inter alia, human rights issues.
Discussion on the subject
Both the CEO of Cologne Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, withdrew their participation in the opening of the event when the visit to Erdogan was accelerated.
A 30-year-old from the market told me that he was coming to a demonstration against Erdogan.
I'm not a voice for people who can't go to the streets in the law.
They've been arrested, killed and under arrest.
For Erdogan, everything that is different from his own meaning is what it is.
At the last stage of Erdogan's journey to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish-based.
In Slovakia, three of them are charged with the murder of a reporter.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kukik.
The prosecutor also told me that three people are being accused of the infertile murder of each and this betrothal and other crimes.
Earlier this year, the police arrested eight people for the murder investigation, but the five of them have been released.
Cuckoos were found in the middle of nowhere with their betrotheds in Bratislava, where they were found.
He had studied the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
There are suspects of murder related to Kukjak's investigations.
The way and the article in each article have taken care of the freedom and corruption of the media in Slovakia.
There may be a problem with the distribution of cattle in land-use areas.
Due to the error of the printing, the Karjalainen of the same person may also be posted as an addressless person.
This may be published in the publication of this publication in the section-institutions in which the talk is to be taken into account from the external memory.
The situation was the same with regard to the two others, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The press will put in an additional tabloid in the province.
Leaves of other Finnish subscribers will be posted separately only on Mondays.
The issue of leaves is obviously delayed.
Water is a Finnish explosive
Editor Arto Nyberg is interviewing Vesa Heila, among other things, in his forthcoming discussion programme today.
Vesa is in the studio about her coming from a database she provided by Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The cost was EUR 151 000, which was required to be paid as a bank loan.
If the only ways had been true, Vesa would have been in the space by now.
However, Monday is a year away.
Now it seems that, after the unfortunate trial that took place in 2014, and after the death victim, things are real.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or next year.
The flight number of Vesa is 300, which means that his journey will take place about one year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and is in a weightless state for 5 minutes at 100 km height, the Finnish anthropologist tells you about the future at his homepage.
At the same time, he also backgrounds his need for space.
As a child, I read the space travel comic magazine and saw the Star Trek series on television.
The Star Wars have been seen, and that's what it was all about.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
I was thinking about him. He was a real father.
He continued his loss-making process in Electoraliga, when it knocked down at his home on Saturday at Brighton's goal of 2-0.
For the sixth season of the reigning team of governors, the guarantee men are the paint syringes Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüro.
Sterling was able to push the fourth of the month from the nearest distance to the finish when Leroy Sané found him in the 30 minutes of Brighton's return to the ground.
Agüro raised his own ground saloon to five when he sawed out with Sterling in the '65st quarter of the Brighton defense.

At the end of the second meeting, the youngsters decided to finalise their three-year term of office for the years 2019-2021.

Uulmilton praised Kimi Räikö and astonished by Ferrari: "To lose a very important driver".
In an interview with Mr. Mersu's British writer, the newspaper Blok asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikös from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the month.
Hamilton leads the second driver of the Ferrari at the M.M. point at 40 points.
A little less than three months ago, Ferrari told me that Päikki will not be in the stable next month and at the same time, he will be moving to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton does not believe that the Päikönk would throw gloves in the counter.
I don't think Kimi's going to be in any of the remaining races.
He is an extraordinary professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite tops and I am convinced that Ferrari is a very important driver.
For me, it doesn't make any sense.
Hamilton has previously told us that Päikön has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows about this, but when I was young and I had a dream about the shape of a number 1, I played F1 game at PlayStation every day.
I'll always be Kimi, what's crazy, Hamilton said it's late.
Day-to-day Sunday at the Russian part-time.
At 14 a.m., the race starts at Mercedes Valtter Bottas.

The football A-youth SM series championship competition became a total farce: the opponent will only arrive with the power of 7 players.
The maximum balance between the football boys and the next day of the month is reached.
The starting points for the championship campaign were clear: the FC Lahti Academy was well-lined in practice against the Left IFK at the beginning of the 13th round.
To make this clear, the second Ilves in the championship must be able to compete for PK-35 and encourage the loss of Bays.
However, the lattice championship was in fact already confirmed by the start-up vigour, since the Left IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one second, the fight would not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won 16-0.
In the meantime, the bays were 7-0.
One reason for the loss of a vasian player is that the team has played in part on the same players the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the second C-section.
The Left IFK has been threatening to fall all day long in the Second Directive.
In the second decision, the Left IFK will be forced to win the JBK in the guest debate and hope that New York will lose its own guest match against KuFua in the Silinjärvi Tovala.

Serena Williams is freaking out on the video where she's playing in the top parts - she's campaigning for cancerful information.
Tennis's superstar Serena Williams is reintroduced.
Now he was campaigning for the knowledge of an adversary, using his own computer account video, where he was only playing his hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The site is the year 2001 hit by The Divinyls I Touch Myself.
Mr. Videos supports the activities of the Australian MED.

The Ex-Managers claim that the fees paid by the Robert Helenius are not paid by the Robert Helen.
The boxer Robert Helenius evening fight against Erkan Teper is holding back the financial dispute.
The evening news was sent today by the boxing manager Jaakko Helmis and the Vice-Court Jussi Kokkla, who applied for a proposal for a proposal for a fee of more than 80,000 euros for a total of indemnity management fees.
According to the call application, Helminen and Kokkila are working for Helmus on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've been trying to talk, but there's no other way.
There has been a clear mandate here, and the work has been done very much, Kokkila tells Ilta-Saom.
Helenius’ present manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to the evening paper, which tells us about the events of the boxer’s vision.
Helenius disputes the debtor’s obligation to pay the amount due.
According to his reply, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in economically in the heat of the crisis in Helenus, and had promised to organise games and sponsorships for him.
In fact, it was decided that Helenius would be obliged to pay only a percentage of its prices.
Once again, it was assured that Helenius did not have to pay for anything, just received the revenue he organised.
This is also a normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
There has never been a pattern of wage and salary work, and it would also have been absurd in the situation of Helenius, Sundman in his message.
Co-operation was never made into a written agreement.
According to the reply, Helen would have begun the distribution of income in writing, but until the end of 2014, Kokkila and Sundman had come to the draft.
He decided on the proposal for his own sake and worked with Kokkila and Helmis to work together.
Helenius has no contact with Kokkila and Helmis at this time.
After the end of the year of the cooperation, Helen had received a "unidentified but massive" invoice for the work of the manager.
This year's action is based on the same arguments.
Heius considers the actions of Helmis and Kokkla to be despicable, in reply to the reply.
Helenus will meet us today at Erka Teöt Stuttgart, the seventh of the heavy challenge list of the IBF box.

Sari Pippop left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - I was thinking about the idea of a comic: the lack of art in drawing did not explain the lack of art.
In the past, I found myself in a moment's time at the sound of my husband, in which he meant it to be a story I've been developing, says Sari Pikku, the Hungarian comicist, the mother of home and the former EU translator.
Sari Pippi says that he was an EU translator who had done economic and legal matters in Brussels until after the fourth month, the family became a returnee ten years ago.

The 2014 picture was a new one.
the story is that he had never dreamed of making a picture, even though he had read about Aku Ankka, Tint and Asterix from a small point of view.

At first I made a few tens of manuscripts in the record box.
My daughter Vivi Valkama (p. 2000) is a skilled drawr, but I did not get her to come along until the summer of 2016, when I gave her a Vivi cartoon.
His enthusiasm lasted a decade of Stripe, and then he had to start to try himself, so to speak, the Notebook, which tells the disc that I made him a great instigator.
The tablet is a simple and handy tool to try to get something in time.
I didn't even try to draw, says Pikku to draw up a relationship, he's actually working at night.
I keep thinking about the manuscripts, but usually I don't do it once in a while.
In one of the third stripes, it takes not more than once for a single three-thirty strip.
I might make a square and a game with a color.
Starting to define is always the most difficult thing, because drawing is not the most important thing.
Sari Pippi tells me that he's been thinking about the second series of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
The natural person is the mother of a bunch of people who have lost their lives in the L-them with a salad brush.
The other persons are Man, pee and Twins.
The world of nature is what it eats.
The ideas of a pile come from their own life and from their own common media.
Sari Pikku doesn't want to talk or offer you a straitjacket, even though there's a lot of stuff going on in there.
The pip tells us what it reads with its many legs and at the very least.
It's so nice to look at your drawings and say that I've done this today.
And there's plenty of trouble at home.

In Indonesia, the Indonesian Air Service has honoured the Sanctuary of Agung in the Social Media.
Rehn wondered above the end of the European war on trade: "We need to look at the next twitter"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the world as a whole.
All over the world, growth forecasts have been calculated, as well as the Bank of Finland has slightly reduced its own estimates.
Director-General Olli Rehn said with Yle that, although the tightening argument has no direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the decisions taken by companies.
This is also the case for Finland.
In the opinion of Rehn, Europe is a good bakery for the time being.
It has been able to secure the peace of mind with the United States of America and has also been able to calm down with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be facing a trade war.
Let's see the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable project towards Washington, but he said at Yle's interview.
We also have our own choices.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, which is also one of the world's most respected countries in the Western world.
The market reacted sharply last Thursday evening by the Italian Government in a clear deficit budget.
The deficit for the next year will be more than 2,4 % of national output.
Mr Rehn considers the Italian affairs to be important.
Of the country's loan stock, 9 % are deficits and non-mandatory loans account for more than half a percent of the country's loan.
Its economic situation is still under way and the country is mutually reinforcing with its partners.
It may not be worth painting yet, Mr Rehn, when we asked him if he would take the new European economy.
The second challenge for Europe is the UK's difference between the EU and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be a deal.
The difference between today's separation would be a lot of ladies and gentlemen.
Rehn started under the supervision of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) will resign in a year's time.
The following debate has begun.
Both Rehn and his brother Erkki Liikase's name are in the ring of words.
It probably doesn't matter if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that you are not going to comment further than this.

During the evening, journalists and photographers present on the stage will tell the Secretary-General, which they have prepared a long time ago, which has not been published in any other HS instrument.
There's another thing in there that nothing has ever heard.
"There is a strange spy in February, an impressive report from across the globe and a talking story about a very current health issue," says Esa Lily, one of the producers of the Big Box.
After the presentation, it will be possible to meet the editors and photographers of H.H. and to continue the discussion.

The Drone part of the game is world wide: "We're asking about education".
According to the principal of the University of Applied Sciences, the police can also use the drones in addition to missing search, for example, in the field of forensics and research.
On Tuesday, Oulu was only able to find out with the help of the drone of the missing snuffler in Raah in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, the principal of the University of Applied Sciences, referred to the case and mentioned, among other things, that "by means of an ex-ante study and training, we are also the world's top priority here".
Drone is a very new upholstery and even more recent positions.
Where there is no record of the use of the drug.
According to the spirit, there is a strong idea that this is the case, however.
This has been resolved, for example, when the experiences of the Finnish police have been reported in international events.
There's a lot of interest in it, Himberg says.
I wonder if it would be a good idea to have a visitor look at the Drones in Finland.
We'll ask for training.
Close the scene
Himberg points out that it is very important that Finland finds what has disappeared in winter conditions as soon as possible.
The reason why, in the case of Raahen, the injured were found using the drone for just a minute.
The police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Hemberg says they're meant to do more education.
The current use of the Drone in police duties is widespread in the future.
I dare say that, Himmberg tells me.
In addition to looking for missing persons, Mr. Manming says that he can use drones for example in an accident or crime scene and for some kind of investigation.
For example, we already need to check a region a little further, where there may be some fear that there will be violence there.
Dronea can then use it for a preliminary discussion.

What's the good side?
A lot of talk has been said this summer.
The President of Nokia, Risto Siilasmaa, in his interview with H.S., stated in his book Paranoid that he was optimistic about his leading philosophy.
While judging the leadership of her husband, Jorma Ollila, she is also critical of the leadership of her husband.
Ollila argued out loud about the attacks, but even in previous Nokia reports, the inability of managers to act as a team has been mentioned; fear and nonsense, in which case the failure of mobile business has caused a breakdown.
In the mid-term, efficiency and agility have disappeared.
A business event in Helsinki took place this week in the Nordic Business Forum, which brought the Finnish Business Centre to Finland.

The legend of management doctrine, Gary Hamel, said that the good leader must dare to take the treaty, even when the company is doing well.
The point is that decisions are made by those who are spiritually most entrenched in the past.
John Mackey, the founder of a large organically-based, well-known Whole Foods market, said that it should be able to communicate to the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
This is not supposed to be just a win-win for the owner.
Susan Cain, author of the book of success introverts, reported that the most successful leaders are most exposed to trial.
They function calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they are introverts.
Aswath Damodara, a financial professor, reminded him that the qualities of good must be met by one company at a time of life.
In the early days of the beginning, the leader must be able to tell a story on which the future of the business is based.
The adult company who grew up in the wrong phase is the leader of which the numbers are.
These guides were heard by 7 500 visitors in the Nordic Business Forum - mostly Finnish leaders.
Vaorana had a data stop.
A lot is required of good leadership.
That's why the lead is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
Siilamaa and Ollila were also present.
They used to talk to each other all the time.
They wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
Their humility was not easy to evaluate.

The name of Macedonia has been responsible for decades - now the people are voting on this matter in a controversial election.
In the Netherlands, the new name of the country is currently being voted on in the Netherlands.
In accordance with the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia, the name of the Republic of Northern Macedonia should be entered in this Agreement.
To date, Greece has prevented the attempt to become a member of NATO and the EU by veto law.
According to rural development, the name belongs to the northern part of the country.
On the issue of the vote, it is not a question of new ideas, but of whether or not the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by adopting the agreement.
At least the capital of the capital began in a school in the city centre of Sköbje.
The senior nurse Olivera Argirisvka, who had voted in favour of the agreement, wished for the agreement to be supported.
The vote will mean an amendment if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
That means a change especially for young people, he said.
The name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts with the country since its independence in 2009.
The Prime Minister, Mr Zora Zaev, has advocated the adoption of the agreement.
The dissident right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has, on the other hand, called for the referendum to be boycotted.
In addition to the result, what is exciting is whether the polling increase by more than 50% as required.
The vote is not binding, but, yes, the victory would allow the Constitution to be changed.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament's votes shall be required to amend the Statute.
Parliament is still an agreement.

The students are acting in a very small way: an ancient tragedy - amazed Orestee is influenced by vision.
All the tragedyes are very rare on Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen an ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoketes, in 1988.
Now the University of Theatre brought back the only remaining dramatology of ancient history, Aischylös Orestea, to a tour of the National Theatre.
In the Lavattuut! projects launched in 2015, actors from the University of Theatre are working with a professional director internationally.
The director of the fourth project, as well as the first, is Mikko Roiha, who lives in the middle of the town.
At first, Orestea was hit in the back of the road in the middle of the year.
The settlement of Orestia to the end of the bloodbath of the doomed Atreus family, and the rule of law, was adjourned to twenty minutes after the destruction of the report, even by the completion of the choir sections.
The success of the work will be very faithful to the spirit of the Grand Grand Prix (2003).
The dramatic lights and the presentation of the panel's pages highlight the simple and bright way of acting.
Its centre is the dynamics between distinct performers who perform nominal roles, and the chorus.
The presentation is used for both dual and triangular titles.
The actors are not missing at all, so for example, the stories of Amamnon, who is returning from the war of Troy, and Kassandra in this meeting appear on the stage, as was the custom of the ancient show-tradio.
Of course, the performance does not highlight the loyalty of the ancient performancetradito.
Rather, in the eyes of the viewers, a modern, true translation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of the rituals of its essence.
Roiha has succeeded in getting a number of rhythms from acting students in the master stage as an integral, indeed as one, organism.
In particular, actors who are well-expressed in choir distributions, who bend to sculptors, are able to access their rights on the naked, only with the decoration of the white premiere, on the stage.
I'm impressed.
The presentation of Orestea will continue at Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The fisherman prepares his first hydrogen ring.

By importing a market-based truck, Hyundai will continue with Nexo and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models by referring on the road as a manufacturer of hydrogen cars.
In the world's newest project in the world, we are moving further and further beyond the fuel cell technology.
We are also constantly looking for ways to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the fuel system, the Vice President of the Hyundai Motor, in Cheol Lee, at the announcement of the agreement.
The fists have flown several times in Kajaani.
A little over 30 men were assaulting three men in a restaurant in the center of Kajaan and serving it at the same time.
Where he first hit one of the insides of the place where he was removed from the place.
In the middle of the night, he was in the country of another man, and in the absence of another man, he was also hit by a perp.
He caught the rapist.
At the station, the man continued to move aggressively and kicked another voice into his leg.
He also threatened the police with assault and killing.
They took him to the jail to calm down.
The case will be investigated in three cases of assault and the official's violent opposition.
In the middle of Kajaan, there was also another case of a stroke in the middle of the middle of the night.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, about 20-year-old Kajaani woman hit the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down and beat him up again.
The men who were assaulting the men who were more than the victim and called the police.

The site will ask witnesses to contact Kajaan police by telephone or by e-mail at ус.kai@polisisi.fi.

Here we go.
Everyone has said that I live on a daily basis, he commented on his situation a month ago in the paper.
Trade and security must be ensured.
For the first time in 19th, I received a newspaper issue in 19th.
When a subject gets caught up in the next few years, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9) about the safety of retail workers, I was upset and at the moment I was very busy.
I also discussed the issue of the Services Trade Union (PAM) work environment expert Erika Kähä.
He says that crime methods do not tell the truth.
is growing, even though the employers claim otherwise.
It is only clear that cases which have been repeated and many people who do not understand what is happening are missing.
"Of course, there is an attempt to close the situation on the basis of safety at work, and these statistics remain for internal use and not for all of them," he said.
Their injuries do not result in a head count.
In violent situations, the problem has always been that it does not always produce physical injuries.
In any case, mental trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threat of violence is likely to be drawn if even a level of aggressive threat is to be considered as violence - even if it would not be possible to get involved.
Too many people are afraid at work, even though not everything is done at all.
Residential areas are restless.
The deal has been acquired by security guards.
In the wake of the opening hours of trades, there was also a lot of steaming in the media for salesmen.
"Therefore, many employers organised security services at least for night hours and alone to prevent work", Kähä commented.
When nothing is done, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This would now seem to have had an effective effect, and this will create a new fourth trend.
When the security kept the alerts well under control, the idea was that security would be necessary.
In many places today, we are trying to find solutions to prevent expensive shelters.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that the seller who has been dissatisfied does not want to ask questions about a criminal who usually lives near the market.
However, the same, according to the law of the law of 2011, a mild assault will become subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
We need precedents now.
Next time, I'm gonna have to go out with my aunt or uncle, I'm gonna have to check it out and the D.A.'s gonna charge you with it.
If a right were to put a couple of perpetrators in prison and a conviction from the prison to the prison, they'd get cleaned up.
A society where the shop must be open for almost a day in the locality must ensure the safety of the workplace.
Heidi Sohlberg said to Miss before the launch of the live broadcast - "Sara, Iiro has been married since then."
This year, the crowning of Mass will not be seen on TV as usual, but will be shown on the Viafree site.

Backstage and the new carpet are the founders of Janni Hussi.
Don't send a direct message to the hostequipment trio told the guests who had arrived and to the media about the outcome of the broadcast.
At first, Sohberg asked me to give Harjula some fresh applause.
All of you, everyone, scream!
Now, let's see this man-run man, Sohberg, hastened his fellows in the horates of the audience.
There are many of the most recent games in the world of Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sippi sat next to each other and Sohberg threw a little bit of thought in one direction.
Sara, Iiro is then married.
Sohberg went looking at the Vias.
Most likely, Sohberg referred to the recently divorced Sippi, who was thinking about the point of interest, even though each and every one of them was confused.
The student talks about the difference for the first time in the Ilt-Sanoma weekend.
Missuotaar told me that he did not want to open the grounds for divorce to the public more publicly, because that is between him and Roope Salminen.
He said he wasn't in a hurry for a new relationship, but he's thinking about himself.
My real story and the business of living my own life alone, Sara Suppi told me.
Harjula's marital status came to light at a later point when Sohlberg was accidentally mistaken to call Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The count three laughed at the mess.
Iriro was married, wasn't it? How did it go?
Janni Hussi as your dick.
The Nordic man tortured himself by cutting, texting, and feeding a strong caste.
The Northern Court of Justice has referred to a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for three crimes against his numerous open men.
Among other things, the criminal justice tool was a belt, cord, and triggers.
The court condemned these items to the State.
The crime charge was also a suspect in a gross rape.
However, the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice of this case is not the same as the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Four abuses, gross assaults, coercion, threats of the law, abuse of intelligence, serious abuse of intelligence, and two offences were reported as the cause of the criminal.
The crimes occurred between last 26 and 24 May.
At the end of the last actions, a man shuts up and was imprisoned a few days later.
Last Thursday, the Nordic Court of Justice issued its judgment and issued a 34-year-old sentence in Vaasa.
There is no evidence of rape.
34-year-olds were also accused of two gross misdemeanors and the brutal rape of 22 days ago.
However, these factors may be found to exist.
The case was dealt with in court behind the doors of the house.
However, the Judge-Rapporteur made a public statement of the judgment.
According to the court judge, the accused had committed violence, threats and absconding in situations where this had been tied up.
Convicted the victim with a knife, smoked with tobacco, fed him with a heavy sauce and poured water and tea on it.
In a sense, the right imposed on the State a set of common instruments: belts and cords, tapestries, belts, knives, and toilets.
Witness
According to the court-martial, the parties continued to pursue a common life between actions.
It is apparent from the resolution that most of the most serious acts occurred at the end of the period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim’s 34-year-old must pay a total of EUR 5800 for pain, pain, suffering, suffering and minor harm.
The money is hardly there, for the convicted person already has debts to collect.
Prison punishment is not the first time a man has ever been put in prison.
The evening does not tell you about a convicted attempt to protect the privacy of the victim.
The fresh result is not valid when writing.

Europe won three out of the four four games that started on the sixth, and in the afternoon four games, it was a great deal of 2-2.
Europe's top priorities were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won the second and last two matches.
In the past, none of the Europeans had been able to match the previous situation.
On Sunday, two more goals will be added to history.
No European player has won five points at one Ryder Cup, and no Americans are like Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns his supporters for their fierce interconnection in Honka: "The violence is not part of the capital".
The football betting league team HJK has launched a release in which it condemns its supporters of their behavior in the absence of FF Honka at the University of Tapiola.
"We congratulate the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters", the information states.
After I ended up with about 50 HJK supporters, some of them seemed to try to argue with the Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a battle between the supporters.
The agencies did not allow them to calm down, but needed policemen and also horsemen.
HJK tells us when he announces that the team's players and employees are shocked by what happened.
The post-observation events do not correspond to the values of our usual 111-year-old club.
"We strongly withdraw from any activity that endangers public security", the information states.
HJK is trying to help the parties and the organisers of the event to identify and eliminate threats to security and to remove mild phenomena.
The farmer's household is a part of the foot and a matter for HJK that is important to HJK.
In all ways, we support the positive, joyful and stimulating activities of the Watch Towers.
"It's not the power to do that," they say.
The Philippinesian thinker blows up in a drone car, thus avoiding traffic congestion.
Mendio is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer, and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He is now part of a world-wide population who swears to come up with a lying car or at least his own place of business.
For example, competitors have factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendio does not believe in mass production of his equipment.
According to reports from the world, man has made up most of his property to build his own world.
He started to develop his moving car six years ago.
He now calls the development version a Drone car.
Lately, he says that he has made the first successful test flight - he has flown on his device at a height of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic jams.
The point is that the need for positive reactions is positive.
This was just the third five years ago, Mendio was playing according to the British Daily Mail.
(jj) What to do: Tomorrow, work will begin to take place in children's day care and social and health services.
In public and well-being, well-starting overtime and shifting bans are taking place, especially in social, health and day care, and in day care for children, and the evaluation of the President of the JJ, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be wide-ranging, and they will certainly not be sufficient staff present.
Everyone has to figure out how to get their children.
It is now up to the employer to make sure that the lives and lives are not threatened, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, there was also a shortage of workers at the beginning of the year when the members of the JHL were in the overwork and change order due to contractual negotiations.
Employers are employed by means of flexibilities, with the possibility that the staff has not been hired, but have been over-employed or changed.
This is not yet a work-related work-related action.
It is, of course, absolutely normal for each individual to be kept informed of the regular working hours and to do so only.
HHL object to the Government's intention to reduce the protection of small companies from divorce by acting as a means of action.
Markku Jalonen, the social partner of municipal workers, is not expected to predict the impact of the over-work and change bans.
I do not think, however, that they are very revolutionary, even if they are capable of doing so.
Employers all over Finland are aware of this and make the preparations for what to do.
is so far as to be impossible, so broad, so wide-ranging, so-called, so-called "social and health activities" and the general sector, that it is simple to say.
The effects can vary greatly from one industry to another, by region and by employer, i.e. by Jalanen STT.
Mr. Jalonen says that last year, there have already been experiences, among other things, of activities that have lasted three days, such as those of the Super and the Social and Health Union.
They were rather small.
The HLG's prohibition of overtime and exchanges applies, inter alia, to municipalities, church, state and private social and health workers.
Family day care providers are confined to the outside.
At this point, the work concerns almost 100 000 Members of the European Parliament.
According to Niemi-Lam, JHL may last forever.
The Committee has also prepared for other work in the event of the end of the discussion.
The government should now be aware that it's going through something and tough here.
Both the Ay movement and the government must come up against the nobles.
That's what's funny about it is that some people are already on the table, even though the show hasn't been made yet, Jalonen is up-to-date.
The coral reef with the help of children and adults - in their exercise, they study the life of the raccoon and the sea horse.
The Great Coralliritus of the Members of the Farms received their first prize last spring in Hamburg and the last time it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in the Post Office.
The Great Coral Riding is a work that will be completed at the beginning together with the general public.
However, there is also the support of a more complex proposal, which refreshes and crystallises the initial pieces of equipment.
There's a lot of fairy tales in the theatre for children's parties.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparatory phase of the work.
Korallrius is, of course, not a children’s performance, but a performance by adults and children working together.
It provides adults with information and information on how to reach out for children and how to do business.
The ability of children to throw themselves into activities and joint games is also the ability to dissolve the distance between adults and children.
The big coral reef is about some sort of satbalet, fitness, and nature information, but at last it is erupting in other, non-human conditions.
The big coral reef comes from the introduction of corals and coral reefs into the business of living life and fish.
Six different fitness areas teach, among other things, the life of the horse and the sea horse.
Finally, an hour-long presentation will be made in which music, photos, and shiny goals and costumes will be made to learn about the life of the coral reed.
There are both diving people in the big coral reef that observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being examined.
There are also corals looking at houses.
Looks and sightes in many ways make the matter more intense and the world is collapsing.
There's a landscape of life, a view of the landscape, a view of the body, a view of the body, or a view of the body, and all at once.
For a child, it doesn't seem like anything else to me.
In other areas, the group is working on the line between thinking and action, where it is difficult to reach when both children and adults are involved.
Family involvement makes it more important.
After working time, a silent demonstration will be held at the Sistrator on behalf of threatened corals.
The loss of understanding of the mind must not be allowed to be harsh, though it could be possible to understand what it means to exercise your own sense of mind in front of the vision anymore.
In these areas, it has built its works in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also by means of a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species and future generations, for which it is a breeding space and for which it is for all.
Children grow up too fast - I am glad that my childhood did not have cell phones.
Today’s household and young people are even more responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking all the time at the highest and the younger.
I think that a child should be a child for the whole of his life and not mess up his life for the sake of drinking and living, because others do.
I was confused when my buddy told me that he had had to go to his sister in the fifth grade for a night with a boyfriend.
When she came to get her intoxicated sister, she told me about her sex experience from that night.
I can't possibly imagine my own sister at the same time, because we've been told and warned for the rest of our lives that you can't touch drugs and sex is a thing of life.
I want children today to be able to live a decent childhood and do not have to get married too early because of the gang pressure created by friends.
I can still see the older girls in the real world, who are in their pictures with makeup on their face and telling people on top.
Snapchat is used to take and send images that are very clear.
Of the jobs, it is even worse to know what kind of people they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look 18-year-old and older.
My child consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad my childhood didn't have cell phones.
I felt like being a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people were thinking about me.
Yle: The authorities informed the government that the Instituto Helmi case was not related to national security.
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Ilkka Kanerva, your police and defence forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this year.
The Finnish government has been informed that the Instituut Helme is not currently involved in national security, but in organised crime, Yle knew.
The strength of information on the sources that have been reported anonymously is the President of the Committee on Defence Ilkka Kanerva (kok).
According to Kaneva, this time, the Defence and Defence Departments of the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees were consulted on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered to be a criminal offence.
They were very strong that they were not speculating that this would be different, Kanerva commented in Yle's interview.
As far as information is concerned, there is no evidence of the seized material so far that there is no link with national security, but the investigation is just under way.
There is no way for us to know what can be revealed there, one of Yle's interviewing statements.
Six months ago, extensive search into the islands and the continent has raised the question as to whether the investigation is merely a matter of economic crime or a threat to the internal security of Finland.
Earlier this evening, a case was put together in which arguments are being discussed both in favour and against.
TV: Netherlands lost in series
A hundred percent of the start of the League of Europeans was completed, but it was still a happier team of 1-1-1 games in Stamlock Bridge.
Sunday will be one year from the time you arrived at Stamjord's and escaped to 1-0 to the guest's gain.
Sop Guardiolan's entire Valioligan signal was signed by Sop Guardiolan that City was now serious.
Everyone knows how last month ended.
And I must have been in charge of Jörrün Klop with the same idea in West London.
The Reds had begun in the Valioliga six consecutive ways.
At first, stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to be in control of his own place alone.
Callsea was in the middle of a Wednesday's great league of guest profits from Anfield.
At that time, Eden Hadd came from the exchange bench to solve the fight with a huge individual performance.
Now, of course, the lie was right from the very beginning.
On 25th, he played first in a small space with the three-player Mateo Kovacic and George Gyno.
Finally, the gure saw the Merdit rush forward and sent a perfectly weighted pass through it.
On the side of the prison area, the trap went a little further, but bombed the lower left leg of the bomb to the back of the drag.
Mr. Alisson was a little slow in his fight, and he didn't get his finger on the ball.
Certainly, Klop was in the middle of being unfair, because immediately immediately after the attack, Rüdiger laid out the direction of Mo Password.
In the second period, Brother Chelsea Kepa was also involved in the facts.
The Basque Watchman reacted quickly to Sadio Man's bet and pushed the ball from the point of view to an angle kick.
On one side, Alisson, on the other hand, threw away the quarter pass.
The best place for visitors came in the 72st century when James Minner was in the process of Bobby Firminon.
However, Brassij's push turned to the country teammate David Luiz, who was the leader of the hosts.
Nor did it last in 89 minutes, when Daniel Sturridge was free to shoot at 25 metres.
Sturridge played on his old home stand, and the shooter kicked it up in front of an unobsessive bet.
The 100 percent league start was completed by the 1st game, but it is still on the move - together with City.
Chelsea is also well involved in the championship with two points behind the top.
In the communication discussion, the potters are deep.
I remember a year ago, one question was asked by a number of Finnish influences that share the people of God.
The only thing left to think about was the reply of Juice Widow: Nen-Decision.
In some parts there is a net end and some do not.
The divider can come anywhere, and here's one of the good ones.
Finland has created in the EU that the annual clock shift is about to be abandoned.
Many people agree that changing the time twice a year has been a fool and caused a lot of problems.
Finally, at least the easiest step of the decision in Finland, although it was not easy, is the result of this process.
The hardest thing now is to determine what time is left: the current summer or winter or any other time zone.
You can also access the public's database.fi website.
The question has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open on 12 October.
The conversation is having a lively conversation in coffee tables and in the evening media, and everyone has their word.
Wintertime defenders justify their position in the light of light for human well-being and summer time for the influence of weather light on human beings and, in so doing, on the well-being of human beings and, in so doing, on cooperation.
Both sides have a strong supporter and good sense of purpose.
Of course, according to the study, the light of dawn rhythms the day and gives you a good time.
On the other hand, if there is no need to wake up in the dark, more light on the way people move and better provide the means to stay in the courtyards.
The number of extrapolation after the normal working day is already about nearly there.
I'd like to take both of them, but unfortunately, we can't do anything about our position in the far north of the world.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many in any case.
It is typical for a discussion on this subject that one’s own point of view is driven and the other’s view is strongly opposed.
The opposite argument is not enough, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
Since the most important thing is the opinion, it is worth trying to turn one’s head around.
That's where the hell it is.
This is a very clever argument, because it does not require a great deal of effort, and that is why there is a lot of pain in my mind.
In general, there is always the highest and the same infertility in dispute about types of matters.
It's a long shot, if the alternative is chosen, but it's probably a matter of depending on what it is.
And it always provides the right balconies, if life seems to be modest, too.
If you were fighting for a good guest victory
If the first guest game in the Salibandyn Divar was the first to bring Nurmon Jymä a full of three days.
If she went from Seinäjoki to her home, she had a joyous 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3) win with her.
Nurmo was still on the third stage at the beginning, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time 50.4 the horses Eetu and Juus Lehtiniemi were plotting to win the six-six-six-six.
Both teams were left behind to play the crucial minutes on an equal footing.
Joba was the most powerful of all Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was fiery in any case when Teemu Cinderella (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Ktänen (1+0) were also hit.
Mika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of its creation.
If the ball has a pictogram after three consecutives, it's like a pictogram.
Next comes O-Jyväsky with guests in two weeks.
The Church of En is on Sunday's 200th anniversary of the Church.
The 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno will be celebrated tomorrow in part in very sad atmospheres.
After that, the fire of the church was a shock.
I'm not guarding the house after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is the place to stay.
That is not what anyone would like, is Enan now the oldest church of the Joensuu Congregation.
In the middle of the 12th century, Enon has always been in spite of the governments and other unions of all the world.
The game starts at Eno Church tomorrow at 10 a.m.
After that, the parish house would be held at a cattle’s table.
There's a lot of stuff going on every day, both inside and inside.
For example, you can get to know the help of the retired, 37-year-old congregation governor Ari Räsänen.
The celebration of the church also means the end of a period of one day.
Already out of use, in 1982 a built-in parish house will hold its doors for the first time today.
Now I'm in a stand-up room at the same county house," says Cappa Markku Koistinen.
The church house was destroyed by indoor air conditions, but the church has been in a healthy state for over 200 years now.
Elon Musk is going to resign from the President of the Tesla President - The charges for fraud were set at 40 million dollars.
The engine manufacturer Tesla and the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, have established their legal case with the US market surveillance authority SEC.
SEC suspected Musk was involved in the securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being abandoned by the company he founded.
However, Musk may continue as Tesla Executive Director.
On the other hand, Musk will have to turn away from the President of the Tesla Presidency for three years.
The President of the foreign government will be appointed to become the President of the latter.
The musk is also subject to more stringent control.
According to Tesla, the two leaders must be hired and more closely supervised by Musk in future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay each 20 million (about 17 million euros) to settle the case.
"The purpose of the decision is to prevent new market failures and harm to Tesla's shareholders", says Steven Päikin SEC.
The incident began in August when Musk knew that he might be pulling the company off the market.
Muski also said that the financing of the business was secure.
At the moment, Tvvít has increased Tesla's share price.
SEC suspected Musk committed a misdemeanor.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk was not an arrangement with the company's directors or potential financiers.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
SEC took a challenge to the law of the company and Musk.
SEC told him that Musk was being fined and that he was not allowed to operate anymore under the leadership of the stock exchange company.
SEC was driven by investors, and Tesla's share went into decline.
In Indonesia, more than 800 people are in the process and in the process of cretins of Indonesia.
The number of deaths in the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent events has risen to at least 832, according to AFP, the U.S.A.A.’s Press Office.
The number of death victims is expected to continue to increase, as the destruction is in progress.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake brought up the tsunami that attacked the city of the  Lullaby on the island of Sulawes.
The stun was issued immediately after the quake, but the warning was withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known deaths are, at least for the time being, the Return.
Among other things, the rescue authorities are close to the Donggala area at the centre of the attack, where the situation is still largely unclear.
It is now known whether humans are already dead or not.
Foreign migrations from the borders of the country.
The Indonesian army has been called upon to assist the rescuers in their search for victims.
President Joko Widodon, who has arrived in the region of destruction, urged the people to continue their rescue work in the day and night.
One of the main rescue centers is the hotel in Palau, which is still believed to be between 50 and 60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Head of the Agency for the Management of Rescues, told that the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, which is a popular tourist, could be found in one life.
We also heard people's ambulances, he told us.
According to Syau, there would soon be a need for a clear-cleaning equipment for the mooring and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find those who are missing.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My family is still missing, one writer appealed to me in the Facebook group.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into the hands of entities in the United Kingdom.
Many British politicians were subject to harassment when their contacts were revealed due to shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
The police were able to access, among other things, the ministerial telephone numbers.
It was an application used by the British Conservative Party Convention in the United States.
For example, Brexit is driven by Minister for the Environment, Food and the Environment Michael Gove and former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, who has become the subject of  mutiny.
Several Members of the Parliament made harassment calls.
Due to the lack of application encryption, the public in the application will be able to access the political profiles that were in the mobile application of the Annual General Meeting.
The audience was able to access the profiles using a politician's e-mail address, which was accessible online.
The profile was published in the register to review and edit the data stored in the profile.
One time, a film of Bis Johnson was found to be insulting to the biography and the title of the film.
The image of the media mogul Rupert Murcchi was replaced by a picture of Michael Goven.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows entry into the profiles of other people at these email addresses.
The log-in can be consulted by the person and, if necessary, sent by messages in this name.
The conference application made every reporter, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticised.
The conservative informant asked for an excuse for a data leak.
He said that the technical problems were solved and that the application now works safely.
The UK information authority ICO supports the data leakage.
The application was made by a local Crown Comms company.
The opposition working party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
In the audience of the World Finland, there are every large number of people in Poland who are going to kill them.
Watchful viewers drew attention to the events of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The world’s fast-growing American format The Wall beached Finland to Nelose last time.
Heikki Paase's hosted game show is described in Poland in the same studio as the format of other farm productions.
In Poland's studio, the possibilities for describing were existences, since the format's great 12th high game wall demand for space was space.
During the start-up period, the media raised a studio convention, which was taken to Polish.
He was aware of the discussion as to whether the Polish people in the studio understood anything about the game in Finnish.
The manager of Nelo’s domestic programmes, Une Sormunen, will explain the matter to the evening magazine.
He says that there are close players, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers in the studio audience.
Common in Finnish production of an international platform, as in other countries, the audiences of The Wall sections described in the same production space.
In Finland, too, there are many so-called professional audiences who go to different programmes, the ring background points.
He says that following the game in itself is not so straightforward, because it would not understand the language to play it.
Light and green, wall-to-wall balls are easy for each other to distinguish.
However, foreign-language students are present in the studio with interpreters who are working on the translation.
There are two interpreters who translate the studio director as an automatic interpreter all the time.
The studio director then generals the audience and tells us what you're doing there and what you're doing, says Sormunen.
He compares the way David Hasselhoff and I were operating recently in domestic production.
Hasselhoff was then involved in Talent's Finnish presentations in Finland.
All the time there was a check-in for him, and he knew everything the description spoke in Finnish, the sum of the Sommune.
The typhoon, which has erupted in the south of Japan, is heading towards the main islands, which are causing earthquakes and floods.
The authorities also warn about possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taiwan Tram, but the authorities say that major injuries have been avoided and that there are no known deaths for the time being.
The wind on the southern Okinawa village has been so loud that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK general radio company, people have been evacuated into shields, and electricity has been lost from over 300 000 households.
Over a thousand miles has been delayed, and bullet trains are in most of the stops because of the attack.
The storm is expected to strike close to Osaka for half a day in Finland.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the route, but there are also heavy winds and rains in the area.
Trains are scheduled for today in Tokyo.
According to the pathologists, Tram is torturing Japan until Monday.
The sky of the sky is still my darkest.
It's been the beginning of the day.
The sky was already long gone when the team lost at home last night to Vaasa for more than 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
There are now five consecutive losses, and there are two points at six quarters in total.
No defenseman of the bilge or two lower chain players have yet scored.
The pressure is also increasing all over the place.
I'm going to fight against you for the second you've had almost half of the game.
There's just been a game, and there's no reason to give up.
Of course we must be worried, because we were playing too little.
In particular, the second performance was a shame, for Ässi the power of 1+2 Jarno Kärki told him.
Of course, it tastes good.
The team was down at the bottom of the game, so it would have thought it would be there.
Maybe it did, but Äsät did not know how to use it.
Average labour costs per employee (EUR/tonne)
The mother of the day, Pirkko Hährinen, wondered about the audience of the event at a large hall.
In fact, I was thinking that maybe not so many people in the year would be there, Mr. President, working this afternoon.
In autumn, 2017 At the same time as the Flying Day, there was an SM contest for Tractors, so it would probably be expected that the number would even fall from the previous year.
However, it happened; the items were already covered well before ten, the sellers told me that the products were gone, the news was sold at almost 500 doses, and the number of cars was even higher than the number of cars.
An estimate of the visit has been about 6,000, Ijärinen will discuss this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon of five p.m., there was a great deal of programme for families with children, which I think might have attracted a record.
In addition, the sterling assessment of the event will be even longer.
Also, every year, the sellers would go from a larger area to a larger area than Liper.
This year's performers, craftsmen, pastries and harvesters had arrived at their breadmaker almost a hundred times this year.
The mother of the day, Pirkko Torinen, was admiring the public from the lobby.
The first day of the day was blessed with the harvest.
In the last one, Teja Kiviniemi’s beautiful bread won the public vote.
In the children's bread contest there were 11 different forms of bread.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the Roulette Competition, spent the day in a mart parking lot.

Wake up the state of life, create the right atmosphere for the interior and read the book without fail.
It's a good idea to rain in the light.
We gathered one of three good reasons for the impact on the lighting.
Vinkit gave me the sales and marketing of Inluxi's sales and marketing company, Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do you have a personal interest in your eyes?
The meaning of enlightenment is growing, the more seasons behind it.
Sufficient light can help with problems that many will experience with age when the vision is low and there is still more confusion.
At the very least, there is also the development of light.
Sixty-six needs light three times more than twenty-six.
So it is worth 100 for the sake of reason of the light's maintenance effects and the characteristics of the light.
I'm good to give you enough light, but I don't want to be dazzled, some kind of tipper.
Around the beauty of the world.
Beautiful interiors can only be exposed with the right kind of lighting solutions.
The current root of the moment can be made available.
In your mouth there is a japandi style that is lifeless, candinavious and Japanese-like.
In addition, the 70th century has been inspired by modern and playful retro-tylated dyes, different shades of metal or ice cream, which have grown up to booms.
The loyalty is fascinated in the same way as in the home’s other furnishings.
The materials now contain wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamu.
Your experientialness.
On the other hand, more than before, the home is being introduced, and the content has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, you want your own home to be tailored, brave, with a story to tell.
People are very much looking for Finnish and Nordic products that are known to be the way and the designer.
So we're very design-conscious, Jokiniemi says.
Home does not need to get the latest trend lightest, but the timeless class for which it has been saved for many years.
A certain kind of timeless, chorus and elegant classes hold their positions from year to year, says Someimi.
And bye-bye.
The pile showed a door for the Canadians after three games.
The road between the size of the assembly and the warnor Brendan O'Donnell is breaking apart.
In an orange game, a common customer played three League games without any points of nostalgic, KoKoTo tell me when he informed you about it.
O'Donnell moved to KooKooho in August with one year's contract, which included the entire duration of the probationary period.
The last 26 years old shooter played in KHL in Kunlund Red Star and in KHL in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
The new follow-up of O'Donnell is not yet known.
The gamer wants to look like he's in the recycling - the way he leaves the world in recycling tools, the way he changed paper.
The major game movement Gamer is currently recycling not only the games but also the packaging materials.
The products of kiwifruit customers are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
For example, online order products are packaged for packaging from importers.
All available packages go back to normal.
We can use the boxes for a decade, as long as the package is in condition that it can be used, Ville Purula Ouga's Gamer tells us about the gamer.
As a soft material, paper and other similar materials are mainly used.
As far as possible, dome plastic is avoided.
In the near future, we are going to be moving to recycling material in the envelopes.
There's a lot of other people on the road to show them what they're doing.
According to Wood Roulette, the circular has not caused any additional effort.
There is no problem with the process of conversion.
There's gonna be some savings when you re-use some of the cardboard packaging.
In addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes games and equipment, among other things, games and equipment.

The missile operations of the Russian intelligence services have a long-standing experience in the sabotaging operation of the Russian intelligence services.
There is no reason to assume that the Foreign Intelligence of the Russian Federation SVR or the Military Intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
Named from the Russian-speaking words diversionno-razvedynajnaja group: sabotage and intelligence team.
Representatives of the Soviet Security Service in the West of the KGB prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, reports the archiver Vasili Mitrohi (1922-2004) who had opened the KGB in the west of KGB.
His knowledge was published in Christopher Andrew’s books in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included, inter alia, ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and pipelines.
In Germany, KGB procures for DRG groups the Bundeswehr, media, game guards and particulars for uniforms and costumes for cover-up operations.
This trick was used by Russian parading patients in Crimea in February 2014: they went into local Ukraine police riots, set up inspection stations for those leading you to the peninsula and isolated Crimea from their motherland.
In the cold of time, agents hid packaged for sabotage groups in land, with mortars, explosives, lighters and media.

Several classics are decades old, but sometimes they are more modern.

Looks like boots and opinions, but you should try a brave model, well - feel free to do it.

The non-volatiles fit well for comfortable housing.
They properly balance a pink, flowers plerimant and a gentle, murky needle for a woman.
A fresh, elegant daily uniform for romantic taste.
A thin and highly retrosonic housing is based on a long copper-red velvet dress, overcrowding, looking for earrings and a slingshot.
Even though there is a certain degree of rationality in the superpowers, they are also perfect for the restoration of the everyday life together with the T-shirt, the long shorts and the other flagboards.
It's easy and it's still so smart.

For the first time, motor vehicles automatically travel in other traffic without general traffic arrangements.
An auxiliary passenger on board is always the same as a passenger on board.
Vehicles feel around them all the time on a number of different sensors and assess whether the vehicle is free.
If not, they interpret whether a vehicle, bicycle or, for example, snowflake is in need of assistance, reports Sensible 4 Executive Director of Eesti Santamala, responsible for the development of robot transport.
The robotic cars are running all over the past three days: Tuesdays from 13 to 15 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 15 p.m. and Thursdays from 10 to 15 p.m.

The healing is great, but the bones are improving with time.
Simplify and quickly recover to Santtu and have a good tour of the rest of the world plus tourer.
And thank you for last night's great gig, but promise me you'll leave off a fan of such dramatic gigs in the future?
There are patrols of hunting in North Karelia and Savo.
The police department in Eastern Finland conducted hunting surveillance on the next and the next Saturday with Metsähallitus and Finland's game centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police officers spoke in the middle of the media on Saturday.
The main focus of supervision was on the law and authorisation of hunting.
For each forest, a hunting order and a state-owned hunting permit are required for each forest to enter the country.
Holding permits for hunting weapons and the permitted number of fires for self-loading weapons used in the channelling process will be carried out.
According to the need for control, 112 hunters were imported and only one hunter, who was not subject to a necessary hunting permit, was found in connection with surveillance.
The hunter was appointed 12 days for the authorised request.
The police called in 133 drivers, and two of them are suspected of being drunk.
A number of missions dealt with road traffic offences in the course of the fine procedure, once.
In conclusion, it can be concluded that hunters are very good at complying with the forestry permit.
The forester was surprised by the control of the forest.
The hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years, and this was the first time that I checked the permits".
The Eastern Finnish police will continue to control hunting along with other supervisory authorities.
Going to Turkey to follow the choice of Syrians to choose Syrians.
Prime Minister Kai Mikänen (Kok.) will visit Turkey as soon as possible to follow the selection of refugees to Finland.
It is decided to take 530 Syrian refugees out of refugee camps in Finland this year.
Selections are usually made on a number of occasions a year, involving representatives of the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Labour and the Economy, and the police.
The delegation is already in the process of conducting interviews in law.
The UNSC UNHCR will first select people who are particularly vulnerable to the condition.
In practice, it means people who are supposed to be particularly in need in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick people, children and children.
In Finland, more people are chosen than is in the hand, so there are no different reasons why they should not enter.
There will also be a noise of civil society organisations operating at the border between Prime Minister Süleyman Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Slom, Secretary-General of the Ministry of the Interior, is also on the way.
Talking about raising a computer.
Finland has been an invading force since the 1970s.
In recent years, there have been 750 times a year.
For a couple of years, the kiln was 1,0 48 years, but there is at last no agreement in the general public on how to raise it.
The meeting has advocated an increase in the quota, but it has fallen into the resistance of the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (mid-term) recently raised the quota to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
This is the first time in the month for which the Minister for Internal Affairs will be present to observe the selection of refugees.
Former Home Minister Petter Orpo (Kok.) and Ms Risikka (Kok.) would like to move on to their new duties before the visits were organised.
Finland receives €10,000 from the EU for each highly vulnerable refugee.
Now, let's go get some hays - we don't know if we're crying or crying anymore.
Karjalainen knew about last time from the bill to amend the legislation on veterinary protection.
The article gave rise to the idea that the draft law in principle prohibits the holding of all animals which are not specifically allowed on the farm, pets or other business basis.
So everything else is basically just the animals mentioned in the regulation.
If the draft law ends in law, it would mean that we are rejecting the general principle in the Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that threaten society or the good way of doing so.
In principle, it is now now necessary to lay down a prohibition of any action which the law or regulation does not allow.
This change is due to the fact that nothing can be tried, for example in business and nothing can be done without the law or regulation that adopts it.
Government activity in the preparation of the act has been weak at all times.
If we go now to the idea that basically everything in Finland is expected, something that is not specifically allowed, no longer knows whether it is crying or crying.
I have no doubt that the animal law requires updating.
Such a similar legal project is not part of democracy.
I'm afraid I don't know the Constitution very well, but I'm sure it'll accept such a "all is absent, which is not allowed by law or regulation" procedure.
For one thing, there is one truth that allows the progress of the current legislative project to be achieved.
Metti Forssell project: The fourth most pesky skirt of autumn.
This autumn's trend comes in snake tissue.
It looks especially good in skirts.
Put a snake-dead skirt on a lower top, such as a half- or a single t-shirt, to make the whole housing look like the rest of the world.
In this case, the appearance of the silk, and especially the silk skirt, is one of the most trendy clothing items in the season.
Put the high-end silk skirt together perfectly with the female top or relax with the needle.
You can play with each other more easily and toss on your feet, for example, sneakers or snowmobile cowboy boots.
It doesn't matter whether it's gray, brown, or multifaceted, all square-section skirts are now covered in the most common black-have clothing.
Just keep up with the different colors and play with the square parts on the top of the special-dead.
The combination of the fourth quadricycles and your walnut is beautiful.
Asymmetric beads are a wave of summer lightness that can be taken with them.
At the same time, the asymmetric bead is female and playful, and fits well into both the daily and the night.

Kimi Räikkönen explained the reason for the better Mercedes compared to Ferra.
Ferrari Kimi Päikkinen was able to say that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hot for the time of the Ruut Gp.
However, there is no need to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver assesses it.
They were just faster than we were, but nothing huge is going to happen.
Our car was at the best in time for the whole hour, but they were just too fast, the fourth one driving and the third one driving around with Place Vetel, the one who was obviously staying at the Mercedes speed.
Ferrari was in trouble at the last race in Singapore.
The question was, what's the point of a sudden fall on Mercedes' ride?
They seem to be going faster than we are, so that's how it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
However, I know nothing more than anything else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be above us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was a certain degree of sensitivity in the weather for Saber in Päikkön.
In the next month, Ferrari's replacement for Charles Leclerc was number one, and the last time the drive-by was also on Marcus Ericsson.
The 10th starting point for Swedish drivers is the best for more than three years.
And even though in the second driveway there were five drivers not to drive, the final result was still delicious for Sauber.
And is there a encouraging thought for Räikös next time?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the beginning, then the course has been from the beginning.

That's it - Robert Helenius had a knock-on Erka Tefet: "Robbe is back".
In the evening of Stuttgart, Robert Helenius and Erka Tereja won the fight at a level playing field in the evening.
The German was in the middle of this initiative, but he did not get a good look at it.
A more clearly understandable Helenius controls the fight with his hard series, which found it well.
The Finnish was also clearly in better condition than Teper.
Finally, the solution came in the eighth part, when the pyrexia knocked out at the left right at Teper.
The hit was so loud that the cobra in front of the home crowd was not even trying to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was confirmed, Helenius felt very clearly.
In the event of an explosion, he began to notice the good atmosphere and the adversary created by the public at first.
Then he changed his language for a while.
Thanks to all viewers and Finnish entrepreneurs.
We'll have a seat with you.
Helen was happy just after the fight.
This was a real victory for Helen's career.
There might even be a chance for a World Cup, Helenius commented on Iltalehti before the match.
On the other hand, it could have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course it's in the mind.
There will be no younger here, 34-year-old Helenius before meeting Teper.

It's probably something economic to do with it.
The last book I've ever read is economics, Antikoski.
After the reply, Anttikoski received some fresh applause from the public as a result of laughter.

Kuisamon Rukka, in January, for the first time in the Nordic Journalism, will be the international literary festival in Rukka.
The Nordic Noir event program consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers and jazz music.

Stats symbols do not make people feel like they are - Four facts about popularity.
Makes man popular, charismatic or admiring?
The researchers at the University of Sydney, which analysed the matter, have outlined two different types of "cool", consisting of two very different characteristics: a generally attractive cool and, in particular, a counter-versaal cool.
Fascinatingly cool people, according to researchers, had many of the most widely desirable characteristics: they were eloquent, friendly, agreeable and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were typical of length, independence, rebellion and covetousness.
They thirsted for experience and cared little about the evaluation.
Both types share a good sense and a stable emotional life.
The role of hardy does not exceed cool: a high status in a teenager does not necessarily come to life in the future.
This is reflected in the US research published in Child Development in 2014.
Young people who used to date, party, get into a group of people who are very vulnerable and who are trying to favor others were at increased risk of taking drugs and committing crimes when they were young.
In their lives, they did more than in the past their most noticeable relationships with each other.
The supercars, signs or watches that communicate the status of a person do not make a person fit or at least genuinely attractive to the following.
In the September issue of Social Psychological and Personality, the vast majority of people were more willing to make the most of their brand shirts than they were branded with - despite the fact that most people changed the label when they visited.
If you are at the Greek Holiday Island, beware.
There's a storm coming in, an alarm calling from the red.
During the week in southern Greece, it can rain as much water as in Finland in the second half of the year.
The fear of Zorbas strikes Greece during the weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the territory of the Pelophonnese, the Ionian Islands, the Kykláta or the Crete region.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will report it on its Facebook page.
According to the embassy, the air services provided to the areas are a formal weather warning.
There is also a report of a nearby site in Foreca's blog.
According to it, the storm's toughest trees are up to 45 km per second.
Because of the comparison, the Kuusma storm blew Finland from the beginning of the week and blew it up in about 31 seconds.
But according to Blog, the biggest Zorbas attack is not done, but heavy rains.
A weekend in South Greece can come over 300 metres of water.
It corresponds to half of Finland's annual amount of rain.
The security service Sever Weather Europa has shared a video of the development of the tower on Facebook.
The Zorbas storm has caused fire in Tunisia and Libya this year.
Do you know how to play Love Finland -Ankuna?
There's going to be a mess about youtube-style.
It is rare to know that in the Love Island Finland series, the men's beautiful Anku is also featured in the recent Youtube data published in 2010.
On video Anku advises ascarers, among other things, to prepare ink from the old economic paper roll.
Ank also seems to be in a sympathetic way, in any way, how to ask for a stylist, to which the real spikes are going.
Now let's get the main grass to grow, but let's do it in a little surprising way, Anku hints and looks at sawdust, pantyhose and the weed seeds he makes.
You can watch the video from below or from Ankun Youtube from here.
Eltter Bottas stared and hit the adrenaline in Soch - would he be helping Hamilton on Sunday?
Valtter Bottas was shaking for a few more minutes after the Russian gp battering when he was in front of the media.
The first of Mercedes's 18th Best Hamiltons and was certainly critical of all the criticisms of this month's Finnish author.
Have a nice time.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the decision in the middle of the round.
All right, well, I'll be a little more than that, but Bottas got it.
I've only been to a stake once this year, in Austria (mid middle), since it's been quite a while.
This track has been good for me before, and I have had good turns again.
It is not easy to pass the Sochi track, so leaving is particularly important.
Of course Bottas was asked whether he was driving a win-win or whether he was in front of the close-to-miss Hamilton's jesting of the World Cup.
My starting point for the race is definitely that try to win.
There can be no other goal, Bottas palatti, in the face of the stake.
As a stable, we fight for both championships.
The driver's head is a long time and the difference is a long time, so we should keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was truly happy about the success of Bottsa after the ride, and Mercedes' stable boss TotoFF was also pleased to see him.
There was an intention to win the Valtter, but he failed in the standby.
Valtter knows that he needs to tear everything to his own advantage, Lewis.
And he was so charged that adrenaline broke out of the ears, Wolff threw it out.
The prosecution of whether the stable allows Pottaks and Hamilton to drive fairly, Wolff claimed to be advocating.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the kiss goes.
The Kielläinen Erno Kisunen reached the rally at the Finnish championship.
The racing SM series was rarely completed.
Never before have the brothers ended up as champions of Finland at the same time.
It is now done in the decision-making race in Turku and Salo, where the Tusulais Eerik and Henrik Kristinen have won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kiinunen confirmed the best achievement in his career, when the third prize was awarded to him from the Finnish Championship of Double-Sm4 category two-wheeled cars.
The Kinnunen and the card reader Ville Mäkelä, competing in Honda Civic, started the Turku part-sale at a distance because the starting points were clear: the top-level team was back to the SM team.
In the darkness of Friday night, two blocks of balance, while part of the extra light was tricking the second test.
That's a pretty shocking third round.
In a situation like this, you don't like to be distracted.
On Saturday, only the second week of Jussi Tepo was followed, Kirunen told me.
To force the United States, Belarus and Turkey to pull away
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, Russia and Turkey to withdraw from Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid Muallam said at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallam said that foreign efforts are in Syria to fight terrorism, and he said that the war on terrorists is "nearly over".
In his speech, Mulem also directed Syrian refugees to return home.
There will be no end to the seven-year war.
There are over 360 000 people out there in the war.
Unicoansler Angela Merkel told me in Germany that a meeting of Syria is scheduled for October, with the participation of the French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of the Americans watched the Supreme Court of Justice on TV.
The Supreme Court judge, Brett Kavanaugh, and the professor responsible for his harassment, Christine Blasey Fords, took a look at the squares at many people.
In the United States, the Supreme Court appointed at least 20 million people to attend its televisions on Thursday.
At that point, Mr. Kavanaugh, named by Donald Trump, and Mr. Blasy Ford, the California professor responsible for his harassment, were the story he had told before the Committee on Legal Affairs.
According to the results, the hearings were followed by six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC with a total of 20,4 viewers.
In addition, the online consultation was followed by a number of many more.
NBC reported that there were 6.8 million people who followed and CNN reported that they had made a record of 8.2 million live broadcasts.
The CNN figure will rise by more than 10 million, with youtube and those who have been followed through the 29th.
Fox News reached 8.000 million goals.
The final results are the channels' own, the TV screens come from the research and data exchange company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the complete questions on Monday, but they are always the tops.
Rarely up to a new million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States are usually only able to access sports games and the great worlds of entertainment and Grammy, as well as occasional events such as Presidential speeches and presidential arguments in 2016.
Of course, there is a trip to the Super Bowl in the US's most popular annual programme, the U.S. football NFL finals.
This year, the Super Bowl scored about 103 million people on the NBC Channel by the squares.
Last year, according to Nielsen, the first speech of the World Cup was attended by nearly 48 million people and more than 30 million people in office.
A top-notch matter
The title of the Supreme Court is of the utmost importance in the United States, since the positions are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scala died in the first year of 2016, and the Republicans managed to stop the then president Barack Obama from appointing his successor.
The first place you open is when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, this is where he retires.
Kennedy was appointed President of the Republic by Ronald Reagan, but on a number of points, he was a so-called common language, the voice of which could be reached by ninety-nine votes.
He was a supporter of abortion and the rights of the sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015, he voted in favour of obtaining the same right of marriage throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his canopy.
At the highest level of his choice, the right to remain in force for decades may be called upon.
Children have the right to have access to information for parents.
Children under 10 years of age have Kanta service for their children’s health information.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
In the beginning, the situation of the Kanta service was still even more important: it is not even possible to access small health care or recipes.
This situation was likely to be corrected in 2016 for people under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be corrected, but the correction has taken a very long time.
Now the repair is in order - in 2020.
Since the problem is true, the change in the legal basis should have been nothing more than a breakthrough.
After that, the point of understanding the lay is the button's press: now we're shutting it down, let's open it.
Of course, your child can show his knowledge to his parents if he has a license or a personal identification number.
Do you know how many 10-year-olds are?
The identity card is paid and the 10-year-old doesn't even get a credit card.
In other words, in the fourth grade of the school, there is currently no access to anything except by asking for them in print.
It is not just about the right of the parent as about the right of the family.
It is of the utmost importance for the child to be able to participate in it.
Of course, the right of your age to privacy needs to be taken care of.
Minors can also have family situations where you cannot talk about everything.
They are often related to sexual health, from which freedom of movement is deeply a matter of human rights.
In the United States, U.S.A. started to erupt the root cause of the abuse of Kavanaugh in the face of Kavanaugh.
According to the United States of America, the FBI is investigating two or more of the harassment cases raised by at least two women.
One of these women was last consulted by the Danish Parliament.
In the course of his studies, Mr. Känaugh has challenged the attacks concerning the alleged sexual harassment of his students.
The United States President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the accusations of the separatist commission.
The settlement shall not be extended.
Washington says it's a criminal investigation from a border survey, and it's not necessarily going to become public.
The man threatened to kill police officers in a police station in Kajaan.
The caught bomber still had the bulldozer in the chamber.
Find out if he's put a man in prison for "relax".
The police were the subject of a suspect's assault the other night in Kajaan.
The official will inform you of the case that began when a man of the fair 30th century was severely challenged at the Central Restaurant.
First of all, he was assaulting another customer within the food chain.
This resulted in the removal from the market.
In the air, the fighter attacked with another man by taking him to the ground.
The third party in between, the man still punched him.
It's a three-pronged call.
The party shut up and took Kajaan to the police station, he'll tell you.
The suspect continued to move aggressively in the upper secondary position.
The man kicked another cop in the head.
He attacked the police and attacked them.
The questioner tells me that his address is a man to a prison prison "to calm down".
The man is suspected of three assaults and the official's violent opposition.
Aid organisations are preparing for work at the Indonesian Solawes in the first place - "The fresh water is the most urgent".
The United Nations Children's Organisation Unicef and other international organisations are ready to help on the side of Solawes, Indonesia, reports Finland's Unicef Chief of Staff, Kirsi Haru.
While they lead to rescue, the need for additional assistance is already obvious at present.
Uncef is active in most countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal activities, Unicef always has a full emergency standby, says Haru.
The Commission's proposals for a European Parliament and Council directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Member States.
In the town of Sulawes, the rescue measures are underway, but the situation in the Donggala region is much less obvious than in the north.
Still, there are places where connections don't work.
Aid measures are difficult, because the roads are broken too," Haru says.
Buildings are often complex in the Sulawes, so the damage caused by the earthquake and tsunamis is major.
Once the survivors have been found, they will be safe - for the first time, for example, tents - and clean water.
Clean water is most urgent in times of crisis.
For the first time, people are most often able to make water-cleaning tablets that Unicef has in store.
The aim is to repair the water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported by at least one truck.
In crisis situations, many people get rid of their parents.
Finding and uniting family members is a part of the task of Unicef.
Another part of this assistance is the World Trade Organisation (WFP) (World Food Programme), which is part of the United Nations.
In an initial emergency, funds collected earlier are being collected.
However, among other things, the Unicef has already started a fundraiser to help Indonesia with the earthquake and the tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk, as Chairman of the Tesla Board of Directors, will end the fines of $20 million for tweets.
The founder of space rockets and electric vehicles companies Elon Musk avoids fraud charges by means of a contract with the US Securities Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk ends his duties as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Tesla Motor Vehicle Company and agrees to fines of $20 million.
It also refuses to do so as part of the agreement it entered into with the U.S. market surveillance authority.
In the same way, Musketeer's accusations of fraud are to be found.
The U.S. Securities Commission SEC threatened Musk with security because of the tweets he sent in in August.
Musk wrote that he was preparing an electric car company to withdraw Tesla from the stock market, which resulted in a rapid increase in the company's share price.
According to Mus, the President of the Tesla Council is not allowed to take part in the three­year term of office of the President of the Tesla.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new "inviolable member" to its board and take over two "indigenous presidents".
Teslan must also set up a committee to monitor Muski's communication.
Musk is still running as Tesla's CEO.
In addition to the personal 20 million dollars, the Tesla company will also have to pay the corresponding fines to the financial supervisor for 20 million.
Tahitis mislead investors into misleading their investments.
According to the SEC, Muskin's tweets are misleading investors and Tesla' shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the financing that Tesla bought back from the stock exchange as a private shareholder.
According to billions of tweets, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange at $420 a share price.
Tesla's share price went down by more than ten per cent after the twitch, but then again later.
According to SEC, Muski's claim had no basis at all.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated his claim for funding.
He also had no discussion about the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the board of directors or the company's board of directors.
This weekend, the exchange rate dropped by 14 per cent when the SEC reported fraud charges.
A new agreement is expected to re-establish the company's exchange rate.
The final judgment is not the reason for the final judgment.
The bells of the church don't mean when they don't.
This is a technical error.
The clock at the door tower has stopped.
The wise will see you at 12 o'clock.
It's like a mid-term horror movie: while the church's cryptic is heard of exorcism and you're talking about yourself.
Of course not, of course, but the clock has changed for a serious reason: it is broken.
It's been looked at by the repairer, but some of it's been broken and we're looking at a new part," says Sunda Eveliina Jamsen.
Jamsen is hereby established in Church Helsing -Twitter-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-tel-
In fact, it is said that the final judgment is not the reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen says that church bells do not ring for fault.
