If you didn't like it, I wouldn't do it.
If I don't cheat, I won't win.
When I get closer, the dog attacks me.
I thought Tom was going to die of panic.
If I had enough money, I'd buy the book.
If I wasn't cheating, I couldn't have.
If I don't cheat, I won't win.
If I hadn't cheated, I wouldn't have.
If I hadn't, I'd have done something else.

Please forgive me if I made a mistake.
I will if I have sinned.
I filled the bucket with water.

I've got a place to stay.
I find it wary.
The attic was tested.
I did.
I found the banana on a steep mountain road.
I realized that the problem was simple.
I found this in the books.
I found Tomi there.
I thought that their existence was very obvious, unlike the Esperanto, which is very simple.
If I can, I want to go home now.
I baked the pasta.
Let them, take it if they hit you, run away.
I'll eat my hat if Tomi wins.

My word is I'm not gonna give a shit about smoking.
I give you my baby.
Don't worry about it, Tom, it's just jealous.
Stop that.
Don't worry about it.
I'm hunting in my free space.
I keep my mouth shut so that I don't talk about anything.
He called me this morning.
I saw it three years ago.
On the way here, he's going to pay for the money.
I've got a stick in my finger.
It's been a long time since the end of the story.
I got him to come with me.

I'm late for work because I had to take my daughter to the day-to-day door.
You're out of your hair.
I woke up this morning at six o’clock.
I've been really bad.
I wanted to.
I grabbed Tom at the kitchen.
I said hello to Bett, but he didn't take me for granted.
Welcome to Bett, but he didn't listen to me either.
I am, but I will not lose my fear of darkness.
I think I should have helped Tom.
I guess I should introduce myself.
I'm sure she'll take care of Mary now, Tomi.
I'm sure I'll be fine. I'll be fine. I'll be fine.
I assume that Tamás was right.
It was my day today.
That's funny, Tom.
It was a bad day.
Last night, I had a bad dream.

I don't know who he was.
No matter what, you don't speak French.
I had no idea you were so close to living with me.
That's why I didn't intend to live in a metropolitan area.
There's nothing I can tell you.
I have no one to talk to.
I have no one to talk to.
No one to talk to.

I had to do it on my own.
I had to give Tom some money.
I had to.
I had to give him a pen.
I'm gonna take a look at this.
I had to sit in front of him.

I knew you weren't going home either.
I heard a wolf smile.
I heard they found Tom guilty.
I thought I said Tom was hurt.

I've been helping out with my mom's lunch.
I'll help you with that.
I'm sorry to see Tamás for a little while.
I helped Tom decorate his Christmas tree.
I doubt so much.
I hope that everything but one will end, so there will always be something you can do.
I'm sure he'll come tomorrow.
I mean, you know what I mean.
Thank you, he'll wait in.
He'll wait.
I hope I'm not interrupting you.

I hope we get to the common ground.
True, what you say is true.
True, what you say is true.
I'm telling you, what you're saying is true.

You'll stay in prison until you die.
Without exception, I did not.
I was improvising.

I want to work with you.
It's my place to go.
They all want to be alive.
It's my place to use it.
I've given them an interview.
I invited her over for dinner.
I just got here.

I just think I can't do it.
I just don't want them to see what he's saying.
I just don't want you to get hurt.
I was just finishing up.
They're finalized.
Now I've learned a new word.
I just need some help.
I need some encouragement.
That's all I needed.

It's me.
What do we got?
He left?
Tom lost?
Tom's son?
Tom ready?
Is he still sick?
I stood by him.
I stopped by you today, but you weren't home.
I've been trying to talk to you about it.
I spend about two hours a day every day.
They are very important in school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I mean, you're already packing up, and you're ready to go.
I mean, that's the sound I'm talking about.
It's true that I'm making up for this.
I'm a regular swimmer.
Two and a half kilometers a day.
Do you feel good about yourself?
Are you doing dangerous things?

Is that your mom's home?
I don't have enough access to it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're done.
He'll take his place.
I go to work every day on a train.
I talked to To a few times.
It's up to you.
It came from nothing.
It could be better with your mom.
This goes with the life I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
This is the price of two euros.
Could be a problem.
It could be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work done gone wrong.
Obviously, it's out of hand.
It broke.
I wasn't okay.
That didn't help much.
The snow did not stop.
The snow is not the end of the snow.
It's cool to see if you're coming.
No, it's not.
No matter who did and why.
It doesn't seem like any of them anymore.
That doesn't look right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like I've been framed.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
It was the day before that.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened the last week at the beginning of the week.
This is exactly the day of our marriage, dear.
There must have been a reason for this.
I don't know what's happening.
This happened when he was out there.
One more time.
I don't know.
He's gonna do it every time.
It's not good.
It is its own value.
It's been Tuesday.
I think all fat people should have a diet.
Everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think he's out of the game.
I think I can do this.
I don't think I can kill.

I feel like I'm feeling better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I bought it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think we need more time.
As if I had ever seen one again.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
True.
The probability is very low, I think that you can do it yourself.
I'm leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I think it's time to take a break.
I think this is unfair.
I guess that's right.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mari.
I think you should go now.
Maybe my idea's better.
I think my neighbor may have passed away.
I think you'll be fine with your neighbors.
There's someone in the front door.
There's nothing wrong with it.
I can find the spiders for all of them.
She's at home right now.
Maybe my idea's better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom was something else.
I think that should be forgotten.
all this stuff.
I mean, that's what I'm thinking. That's what I'm thinking.
I mean, that makes me real.
I guess there's no point in trying to convince him.
I mean, they did a good job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
That's not good enough.
I think this vice will do you good.
I think that time will solve this problem.
Tom was already there.
I think Tomi's agitating.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be the only one who's ever married to me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Thomas wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tamás will win.
I think I can handle it.
We need to be patient.
I think we turned the wrong way somewhere.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all a little giddy now.
I think you said the wrong number.
He knows me.
You know the rules.
I think you know what the name of Thomas's girlfriend is.
I'm sure you want to accept this.
You look great.
You'd like that.
I understand that you did not understand.
I think you should go in there myself.
I think you're the real girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I mean, your work is really good.
I think you smell good.
I mean, you weren't sure enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I'd rather we go out and eat somewhere, but that would cheer us up.
I think I can trust you.
I thought I was going to go with him.
I believe in him. I believe in him.
That might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've been thinking about the future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it didn't.
I thought Tomi was still living in law.
I thought you trusted me.
I figured it would come, Tom.
I thought it was home.
I think it's you or him.
I threatened the neighbor to kill him.
That's it.
That's enough. Stop it.
I'm under him.
I was very impressed.
It's dangerous.
It's a history.
Combating to learn what we were talking about.
I want you to take care of yourself.
Oh, I'm so happy for you.
I have doubts as to whether it will work.
It's too bad to start.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
People are hard to understand.
It is high time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
Basically, it's your fault.
It's in the back.
Yes!
That's what it is.
This is my bedroom.
We must prepare ourselves for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too much to study.
Good to see you.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The alarm cannot be switched off.
It's not the best solution.
This is not the right solution.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not yours.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This is not the 20th century.
It's not the 19th.
Yeah.
Maybe each one of them is.
It's not appropriate to talk with a mouth full of people.
He's snowing.
Still does.
Oh, it's bad time.
You're an idiot.
30 metres long.
She needs to go to bed.
This is too easy for him to do.
It's up to you.
It's a useful piece of information.
There's too much heat.
It is important that you wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diaper.
It didn't work out.
It'll be dangerous.

It'll work if I pick up the polarities.
Consequently, it appears to be bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I don't need anything here.
You could use a shave.
I guess you don't like it here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
This makes me sad.
It's just... it's all right.
This could be a long time.
Maybe that's it.
This can save your life.
Let's enjoy it if we like it.
Maybe I'll be late.
It's got to be.
There's something you need to do right now.
I'm sure it was true.
It was completely stolen.
It needs to be changed.
He never existed.
Never should have happened.
However, I did tell him that I didn't want to.
I told him I would do the best I could.
I told him to come.
Tomi doesn't give up on me.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
You did, but you didn't listen to me.
I'm telling you, I'm fine.
For you, don't walk away.
I've been there for seven.
I told you you'd like it, Tomi.
I have one thing too.
I'm gonna have to take a bath.
I've been in the bathroom for a long time.
I've got it all sorted out.
That's the 58th way out.
I'm sure you're on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital the other night.
I dropped my shoes off.
Absolutely.
It would probably be more likely to be the other way around.
That one broke yesterday.
That's what I'm talking about.
It's a lot of money.
I work out two hours a day.
I have toured the whole of Russia.
I have traveled to the United States of America in Search and Search.
It's working.
It's true.
I tried to keep him alive.
I tried to get married.
I tried to help Tomi.
I trust my life too.
I'm about to keep you informed.
I'm gonna try to get my mind together.
It's a nice flag.
He's a big cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a single dictionary.
Good plan, at least.
Single-grey building.
She's a homeboy.
It's half an hour till noon.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's completely dark out there.
These are all mine.
It's all right, it's all over.
Good and good in reality, but will this practice work?
This is all your fault.
It's already 7:00.
We're already in the process.
It's ten o'clock in the morning.
One of my dreams has always been to live by a stream.
It's always the same notot.
Environmental disaster.
It's a lousy deal, Watson, it's a bad deal, it's a dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
How do you do?
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's gone.
It's a big weirdo.
It's a reputation.
It's cold cold.
It's just as important as science.
It's the past now.
She's safe.
Very dangerous sport, where a minor defect can also lead to serious injury.
It's a pretty old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
It's terrible.
It was crazy seven years ago.
It's been a long day.
That was amazing.
That day is a pain in the ass.
Today is a tough day.
There's been one before.
It wasn't the same week as it was.
It's been two years since she left me.
Better.
Good night to the garden.
Flammable.
Oh, my God.
Cheaper bus ride.
It's me, it's me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on a Sunday basis.
Sunday closed.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's freezing.
I'm so hot, I'm so hot.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get a little change?
It is well known that the bear loves the cone.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
It's completely normal.
All right, now.
It's dangerous here.
Here.
It's really delicious.
Done.
There's nothing more to do than leave it alone.
Being far away is easy to be brave.
It's simple to understand why Tom doesn't love Mart.
As it seemed to be a future.
It seemed that the bus was late.
That sounds absolutely right.
Looks like we just went to school together.
It doesn't seem like anything else.
It's so weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like each one of them.
Apparently, Tom's not in a hurry.
Like you don't want this to work out for me.
It seems to me that you're being honest.
Looks like you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an absolute guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a year.
That's all they want.
Dish.
Fair enough, if you get the same salary for the same job.
It's not perfect. It's not perfect.
It's a long way from being there.
This is for you.
You know, that's cool.
It's getting crazy.
It's becoming a habit of becoming a commonwealth.
We're going to be tough.
It's not easy.
You're lucky to see a dead star.
It's nice to be gay.
It's a good study.
I'm glad you could make it.
That's good, you're gonna laugh.
It is not enough to reach that conclusion.
I can't believe the time has been so clean and sunny all this time.
Write it down.
There is no way to find a bench in this city that can be used.
To be honest. To be honest.
Words to be spoken.
I'm a thief. I'm a thief.
Of course it is.
His head is disproportionately large.
Sleep.
The children already have their place in bed.
Just stop with the money.
Tonight it's hotter than usual.
That's not legal.
It's important.
It is important that parents stand on one side when it comes to parenting.
It is important that we help those who are in trouble.
That's not possible for me.
You have to drown here.
I'll get it right here.
unable to meet your expectations.
It is impossible to do what you do.
You don't know what tomorrow's gonna be like.
I can't believe it, you know?
This is inevitable.
Inspiration.
One.
That's just the other way around.
It takes time for Tom to get in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
All I'm saying is, I don't want to go today.
It's a lot of trouble.
This is essential.
I'm glad you're taking me home.
Of course you do.
It's late.
Today we have laundry.
It's like an overseas field and turtles, they know it and sharks over it like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me.
It's me, Tom.
It's me!
It's me.
It is awesome as it is.
It's too late for a swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life.
This is my life.
It's my problem.
It's my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never cool to have what could have been.
None of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
It's not one.
He's not as big as he sounds.
Of course not.
It's not enough.
This is not going to happen.
You don't have to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
It is not negotiable.

It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me to do that.
My promise has not been easy on me.

We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It won't take much time.
It worked all over the place.
It can work with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It would be hard for me to get out of here.
