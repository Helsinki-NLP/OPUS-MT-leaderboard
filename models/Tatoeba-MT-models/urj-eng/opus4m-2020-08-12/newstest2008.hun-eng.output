European inflation has been missed in food.
Rapid inflation in the euro area is mainly due to the strong growth in food prices.
The November price increase in the euro area in 13 countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation of 3.1 per cent after 2.6 per cent last year - reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
The current date is only likely to be 3% - reported by Bhemberg.
Unlike the European Central Bank (ECB), the European Central Bank (ECB) has failed to cut the base mat by saying that this reduction would lead to an inflationary spiral with subsequent prices and low unemployment.
The ECB has two per cent but is close to maintaining inflation rates.
According to an analysis, the ECB is in its twenty-two traps: 'to talk about' inflation, so that it does not have to act on this issue later.
In Germany, the average rate of November inflation is 3.3 per cent, which is 12 years old; in Spain, inflation has increased to 4.6 per cent from 3.6 to 3.6.
Euro-zone inflation is falling in food and energy prices high.
Current wheat entries have increased by 88 percent and the soy bean exchange rate has reached the highest value since 19 Jul.
Food and food also had to be paid significantly more in 2007.
The world market price for oil increased by 52 percent this year and the next month it cost almost $100 per barrel.
According to the ECB, this year inflation will jump from 2.1 to 2.5% in 2008, but it will fall to 1.9 in 2009.
It is estimated that the 12-month inflation rate will remain around 3 per cent for the next 3-4 months, the annual average rate will be 2.1 per cent.
It is expected that the ECB will have doubled its interest rate during the 2008 period.
The Government sees the government as a country in the Gallop.
Fidesz's support circle has grown significantly since the early part of the day, so it has been the largest leader since 2002, while Gallip has not yet given such a small, 13% socialist support.
For the Commissioners, the difference - because of the greater determination of the opposition voters - would constitute more than two-thirds (71 percent) of the support of MSZP for one fifth of its (40 percent) support.
MKA and the USSR are estimated to be below the national threshold: their contribution to the total population is two percent.
Among the voter's parties, both supporters have one percent more.
The economic consensus is still at the bottom - it has never been so high, it has never been 41, the economic situation in the world has been considered to be very bad, and the situation in the second half is quite bad.
Families are now having a change of their own financial situation after the future and summer's more desirable prospects.
For the following year, the majority of the population will expect further deterioration and only a tenth of the population will benefit.
In December, over all previous years, 71 percent of the polls thought that the principal was better than the Prime Minister did his job well.
In fact, 13 percent of those who have been asked are trusted or very trusted, while 38 percent of those who have been supported by Viktor Orbán are supported.
In the Prime Minister, 54 percent of them do not trust it, in the course of Fides, 27 percent do not trust it.
One of the drivers of the political situation is the extent of society's belief that it is possible to deal with the Prime Minister without a change of government.
While after last year's upheavals, 35 per cent of the government and the government considered it desirable, this ratio is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) sees only the change in the description of new elections.
The reason for the referendum is that 60 percent of the questions raised answer to the question of the right to participate in a referendum is that he would definitely leave and another 20 percent say he would probably leave.
In comparison, only 55 percent would participate in a "day-to-day parliamentary election" and another 15 percent would be likely to participate. The result of the referendum would not be reasonable under the current rights.
The student fees are 74, 79, and 84 percent say no to the year-to-year fee.
If only one of these proportions were to make sure of their participation in the referendum, then 81, 84 and 89 percent of the votes would lose fees, fees and hospital daily allowances.
The most expensive is Aukhan, almost a fifth increase in Tesco.
In the Budantic Trade Triangle, the hypermarks of last year's average 16 percent price increase was held, as opposed to the fact that VAT did not increase this year.
Daily Economy
This year, on average, there was an increase of 16% in the Buda Market Triangle on the day-to-day holiday, but in each hypermark there were a great many thousand forints in value.
Since last December "delivered" in the retail trades price was no longer apparent in percentages compared to the previous high base.
However, it is clearly alarming for consumers that what they had been through in the last few thousand forints last year is not yet available for ten thousand.
The basket of the day in the hypermarket under examination has reached the limit of at least 91 forints of ten thousand forints.
The second basket amounted to HUF 10 5 million.
(In 2003 the basket was put at 6800 HUF.)
Unicum and live fish are almost at last year's level, but they are highly expensive for turkey fillets, both nuts and livers.
KSH followed KSH data in the store at the price of flour and bread, even though we found one kilogram of bread in the Auchan for 139 forints.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product under HUF 200.
It was also surprising in this business that the cost of the two-litre alternatable bottled Coca-Cola was below 200 HUF, so the deposit was only asked for 2 cents for the product.
This year, however, Auchan showed the most expensive in the day’s basket, while Cora was the cheapest in the day’s day.
Compared to last year's prices, Cora 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased the prices recorded at daytime by about 18-18%.
Compared to last year's lowest and the cheapest basket price this year, the difference was 12 per cent, while last year's cheapest and year's lowest prices were 21 per cent.
On average, there were an average of 1480 adults.
Last year's average increase in prices was 12 Ludwig forints, so that at the same time it had an effect on the price rise in VAT.
It is precisely this process that has petrified trade, and it seems that they have not been able to determine what kind of exchange rate to use in a single store, since they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If the speed of circulation of a product is wrongly determined by the trader, it may be likely that the price adjusted for the traffic intensity may be significant.)
The price increase of the sun's basket last year was extremely extreme due to the fact that the maximum price was 1 million HUF above the 6th value, while the lowest price was more than 844 HUF.
This year, this extreme has not been shown, where the current price was 1630 forints more than last year, and the lowest price was 1264 forints.
Compared to each of these two seasons, a disastrous price increase was observed, and over a period of less than 20 months, daily sales of goods in hypermarkets of less than 30 per cent.
(By the way, this does not necessarily justify an increase in prices of more than 30 per cent over a period of 12 months in the statistical process.
As with flour, so is egg.)
According to the day-old basket, the latter seems to be almost impossible, since last year's price level of a relatively expensive product has been producing an increase in prices of just over 10 years compared to the base.
The suppliers of flour seem to be stronger than the eggers, but the dramatic price increase has also been doubled on both sides.
Commercially speaking, hypers do not complain, they actually report a good year.
According to our experience, the number of customers in the three visits is no longer of interest to the price.
They buy a lot of everything, they take the durable food to the ground.
On Wednesday morning, all three of the goods developed serious queues in front of the cashiers because the number of visitors suddenly increased.
However, we know that in rural areas there is less traffic, more than one Member State for research firms that even plans are missing revenue, not only for food, but also for consumer goods.
They save a lot of ground explosives.
This year, more than a thousand infections in the fields have occurred mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygiene conditions of hospitals, the congestion of beds, the overload of staff are not in favour of identifying infections, claims to be the head of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
There are plenty of places to save on infectious explosives.
Recently, MRSA infection has been diagnosed in the Traumatological Department of the Thwarts Hospital.
In a person who was killed after an accident, the bacteria were found to be resistant to antibiotics.
The patient was taken.
There was a similar reaction at the beginning of this year.
The injured person in a severe car accident was released from the hospital, but soon thereafter he had to return with MRSA infection, and he was unable to perform an important surgery due to the bacteria in his system.
Until 10 December this year, a hospital infection caused by 1094 multi-resistant pathogens has been reported in the United Kingdom's Änocomial Surveying System, which is the head of the National Epidemiological Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
This means that these multi-resistant agents caused infections in hospitals, the rest of which are unknown.
About two thirds (6ths) of the females are the MRSA, i.e. the resistance of the methicillin-oxacillin Staphylococcus aureus caused by the resistance of Staphylococcus aureus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria are borne by a third of people in their eyes by the fact that it causes disease.
The infections caused by SA (e.g. sore throat, tonsils, skin infections, sores) are good for antibiotics and can be cured well.
However, if antibiotics are not used at all or in an inappropriate manner, the bacteria that act on antibiotics are highly resistant to antibiotics, which are due to inappropriate surgical conditions.
In particular, in patients with a poor body, elderly or low body weight, severe infections such as infection or blood poisoning may occur.
According to Dr. John's Hospital Director, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such infections are linked to the day-to-day use of hospitals.
The infection must not be confused with the pass, MRSA is not there, said Tibor Nyulasi, where the presence of the pathogen is not examined.
Antibiotics are subject to resistance.
"We provide these patients, the nurse's staff treats the patient in rubber gloves and masks, and they have the appropriate antibiotics for their use," said Tibor Rabbit.
Patients in the hospital should be evaluated for the presence of MRSA in their body, but this does not always prevent infection.
The sample is not fashionable.
An overwhelming majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, however, current domestic conditions and circumstances are not good at preventing the development and spread of multi-resistant diseases, claims Karolina Böröz.
After this effect has occurred in ancient homes in countries, the authorities should monitor incoming patients and separate MRSA patients immediately.
However, in Hungarians, there is no fashion for the microbiological survey.
This may also mean that the National Insurance Fund does not carry out these investigations.
In most cases, this is the case if the patient becomes infected with MRSA, says the chief epidemiological centre of general care.
The European Union has strong recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in medicinal products and national directives to cure certain infections and diseases.
It is necessary to ensure that antibiotics are targeted, i.e. they should carry out microbiological studies so that they do not develop resistance to medicinal products, but the hospitals do not observe this in any case.
Microbiological surveys are even more frequent in the case of fixed and basic costs, said Karolina Böröz.
Spare in infectious explosives.
Police evidence shows that MRSA is one patient to the other through its medical services.
Therefore, the use of hand-washing, gloves, maskes, but there are still significant shortcomings in the courts.
MRSA is covered by drop-infection and contact, but it is not always possible to separate infected patients under domestic pre-donation conditions.
In fact, the conditions are often congested, often very close to the beds, whereas in the event of an epidemic, the patients should be at least 1.5 metres apart.
On the other hand, it is also obvious that Karolina Böröcs is aware that in hospitals in critical material conditions they save on explosives, but the nurse is much more sick, and even more likely to develop infections.
According to Karolina Börz, where appropriate precautions are required, it is likely that there is less evidence of such a disease or that there is a potential for improvement of the cause.
Government against MRSA
The use of MRSA infection is a major cost to health insurance companies, and it is therefore against it everywhere.
However, for example, the government programme included the prevention and reduction of MRSA's occurrence.
It seems that the program is successful, based on the data provided, the MRSA infection shows a declining trend in England.
Among the priorities of the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) are the prevention of multi-resistant events (including MRSA) such as those caused by such events.
He wasn't drunk at the captain responsible for the death accident.
An official opinion has been prepared on the death of a death penalty caused by the police officer in District XXIII.
There is no way that he would have been drunk or bloated, while leaving his post, the police captain in District XXIII, who killed a student on Tuesday, informed Attila Morvai, the spokesperson of the D.A.'s office on Friday after the completion of his/her opinion on the matter.
The opinion supported the initial study, which has already established that the former police officer did not drink alcohol before he was behind the wheel.
At the time, the driver of the station in District XXIII car was hit on Tuesday by a 55-year-old man who did not want to get to the other side of the road at the designated tourist stop in the Kossuth Street of Paris, Paris, on the other side of the road.
(The latter, in other words, that the student does not cross the zebra; otherwise, under the rules of the KRIS, he must give priority to the bending car.)
The shipper lost it after delivery.
As a result of what happened, the chief of police has resigned from his post and asked for him to remain in custody, according to the police report, because the incident has so shocked him.
In that case, the D.A.'s office in Budapest is investigating.
Attila Morvai also pointed out that the former police officer was with the D.A.'s investigation from the beginning.
Another 13th edition
A total of EUR 400 million, totalling EUR 3 signed an agreement on education, the environment and the environment, as well as an energy-supporting framework agreement with Prime Minister Veres and Marta Gajecka, the European Investment Bank (EIB) on Friday, Budapest.
The European Development Bank (EIB) approved a framework of EUR 300 million for the financing of the Hungarian budget for the transport and environment projects under the Cohesion Fund in 2006, of which a total of EUR 100 million was already signed by the parties, and the agreement on the use of the last EUR 200 was signed.
Education-related projects also serve to finance a budget of EUR 150 million under the Euro Agreement.
The EIB has approved all of this for this purpose for Hungary, after the last 150 million dollars has been converted into the loan agreement.
Innovation in this area has signed a €5 million agreement between the parties, which is mainly used by the budget for the Debrecen Research Research Research Development Project.
The 4th metro was also discussed at the meeting.
They agree that when Hungary finalises the details of the financing of the metro with the EU, it will return to whether and how to amend the Treaty.
Thus, the first half of 2008 could take place.
Since 1990, the EIB has funded a total of EUR 8.4 billion of 136 projects in Hungary.
Loans covered by the loan will be granted by the EIB to EURIBOR with an 8-year duration and with no availability commission.
European Real-time Technical Code
The development of the Bulgarian real-estate market is remarkable - the whole of Europe's attention is directed towards the few previously mentioned Balkan countries.
What, where and who are still selling on the EU's cheapest but fast-priced market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most up-and-downstrend Eastern real estate shop now is without doubt Bulgaria, with flat-rate apartments and house-to-houses.
Among the mountains are the most beautiful Banszko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa regions, and Albena, "Arany Beach", "Napos Beach", "Old Sozopol" and "Neszebar" on the beach, but more and more people are looking for real estate in Kavarna and Balchik.
According to the analysis by Re/Max Bulgaria, first of all, the central part of the country will also attract the interests of investors - such as Veliko Tarnova, Gabovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are also buying the particular Rusz.
The capital Sofia offers unique opportunities, commercial and commercial space is the highest return.
Camp is on the best route to becoming one of the most attractive European golf tomatoes, so in addition to summer and winter seasons, it will be a destination for the other two seasons.
Predictors are therefore already buying a lot, such as in the Bansk area.
It is estimated that buyers in Bulgaria are also seeking to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most of these are English, but, in the latter case, from Belgium, second and most of Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present, while Russian customers are traditionally many in the Black Sea and in the Swedish tomatoes.
The buyers can be divided into three groups - say Žij Jankov, Director of the Re/Max Department.
Residents either buy real estate at a price of between EUR 50 and EUR 100 000, or covert old houses for between EUR 5 and 15 thousand, and then renovate them.
It requires good access and communication, and it is important to be close to a big city, shops and usually a local doctor.
The second item is the distance shoppers (Bulgaria was introduced to the first 10 tourist destinations in December).
The third is a business investor that buys in the future for medium- or long-term growth.
The price of properties in the capital is still rising, as demand is increasing.
In Bulgaria, however, real estate prices are the lowest in the European Union, but the last five years have increased by 11 percent in Bulgaria.
The rise in property prices is in principle an increase in payments.
F and the Hungarian word sign
According to the Minister for the Environment and Water, the meeting will be concluded on Tuesday and, on Wednesday after the formal opening, the negotiations of ministers will continue with the international climate control post-2012 negotiations.
Foreigners and politicians from the world are dealing with the Bali Road Plan, which is a post-emission reduction period of 2012 under the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, this is a lively debate between developing and developing countries.
The United States has also indicated that it does not wish to look at the exact figures at present, although it tends to agree that greenhouse gas emissions will fall by 25-40% by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another important thing is that the countries of the countries of the country are also making emissions while providing both material and technological aid to the countries that need them.
It has even been agreed to provide assistance to developing countries.
The subsidy fund provided for in the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by the 16-member Board of Directors, expected to be read within the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF) in Market and Profit.
I'm not sure.
Gábor Fodor Minister for the Environment and Water Hungary supports the EU's efforts to preserve its role as a flagship in global climate protection efforts and to promote the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The Prime Minister stated that the EU will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, regardless of the success of the conclusion of the "Convention after 2012" and is willing to reduce it by up to 30 percent, if other major developing regions of the world and developing countries are willing to take their responsibilities and capabilities accordingly.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol countries in total had reached the target of 5.2% in 1997, with the exception of EU - 15 Member States - minus 8%.
The Hungarian obligation is a greenhouse gas reduction of 6 per cent compared to the 1985-87 period that we are going to fulfil. - reminds the public of the environment.
High stakes in Bali, for which two years a long-term international climate agreement must be reached, otherwise its entry into force would have to expire after 2012. In such a case, the reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new system of emissions allowances, which is necessary for the purposes of the International Agreement on Climate Change, the UN Nobel Peace and the United Nations Committee on the Environment, Climate and the United Nations.
This emission reduction would have to be delayed and it would become inevitable to increase the average Earth temperature above 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to the researchers, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
YouTube is recruiting the United States of America.
Records of actions in Iraq and Afghanistan are published at the video-sharing platform by the United States' Units, with which they make themselves available.
First, the U.S. Air Force (RAF) has received YouTube: Special Forces active in Afghanistan have been agitating since March 2006 about their Taliban counter-activities - reportedly the BBC.
These recordings will be checked by the Air Force Commander of a military operation with a camera equipped with a helmet and will be sent to London, where they will be uploaded to the Internet by the Home Office.
The political message is inevitable.
The air force's soldiers have already launched 139 recordings on the Internet in this way, and the "gas" has been viewed by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence called "defenceheadwaters" in the spring of 2007 and publishes videos on both Iraqi and Afghan operations, while the US Ministry (Commonwealth Office) and the International Defence Forces in Iraq (MNF) have their own Youteleline network.
Police force in Afghanistan.
The Air Force has, in its original intention, been recruiting videos for recruitment purposes, and according to the Ministry of Defence, this is also a good thing for the public to know the true purpose of the presence of the United States abroad.
The propaganda that has been published in such a way almost certainly does not cost the BBC, in relation to traditional, long-term recruitment reports - declared by the BBC to be an expert on the protection of Gordon Mackenzie - but also has an inevitable political message, as it shows in particular the right to have military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game of American games.
The army is also concerned that, in addition to carefully designed censored footage, video videos are also displayed to the dealer, which, as shown by the military's death: in other hypocrites, in "public" propaganda, the officers speak completely about losses, but do not present the evil side of the campaign.
By the way, a number of images of the Iraqi and Afghan military space have already been sent to the Internet, which have been made in close contact, but the United States has only recently found it.
The Americans are playing a much different role, the only downloadable American's Army shooting game, which can be played directly in the hands of the soldiers in a multi-less life-like simulation.
It's gonna be fun and funky Christmas at the minsterals.
Mónika Lamperth Minister of Labour does not seem emotional: he will hold a year-to-year work meeting for his colleagues, who will send him a visit with pogue and coffee from 2007.
There is a ministry where live music is going to be a party, everywhere else, with a tomb and a coup in the heart of the officials.
Buli, Christmas spirit, concerts and buffets - that's how I feel about the truth.
Public authorities are also prepared to do so.
The biggest ministerial Christmas party this year is in the defense wallet, but HM is not waiting for the ministerial staff.
On the December of Avajak, the children of the fallen soldiers receive a gift, and the members of the family of the soldiers currently serving in the Union are also invited to make a public statement.
The archive is worth 25 million for the end of the year's atmosphere.
The National Development Agency (NFU) and the Economic and Transport Office (GMM) kick me out of the other wallets compared to the rest of the portfolio.
GKM's share is held in the future, with a total of 4 30,000 HUF and a total of about 300 and 50 guests waiting for the 100th Ministry.
They will pay attention to the Christmas spirit at the event of the gallery, but they will also be performers and tombols.
The NFÜKO cost HUF 4 70,000, and the National Council of Justice (OIT) was held on Wednesdays - concerts and in the evenings.
The rent cost a million HUF, the stay was spent for over four hundred guests.
I mean, one department of the NFÜ for another holiday holiday is also official: this is from a tender firm, the Hungarian Economic Development Community's common currency.
For this purpose, it was leased to the House of Five Theatres.
The information at MAG Zrt is not confirmed, as it has failed to reach the task.
You don't have to wear a suit.
The OIT building is hosted not only by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Research, which in turn held the Luca Day Ball on December 7th.
They have not been charged for the use of OIT rooms.
Five hundred people were involved at the same time.
The party took off with the Minister's welcome, and after that, it was possible to dance for the rest of the day.
The [orgo] question was given: the ball was not obliged to wear the evening dress or the suit.
The health, work and municipal archives are arranged for a party in Puritan.
In particular, public health services provide a show and a ceremony for workers for 40 000 HUF.
Mr Mónika Lamperth Minister for Labour has officially not been working for a Christmas party, but working for a year's work meeting.
Eighty-eight guests, who - the state department said - will only get coffee and poetas, so the party will be removed from 35,000 forints.
On the other hand, Minister Bajnai Gorgo simply cobbled with his colleagues in the honor of the Ministry of Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) has its own special assembly, which is expected for 436 people.
After all, 2500 forints are intended for the Christmas party - the sum will be paid for a buffet bet and a cocktail.
As President Veres is the Minister, every year, the PM staff perform the same tasks as each year.
However, there will be no bushingalla, not only in the ministry, but also in the afternoon.
On January 20th, the agricultural wallet will give a New Year's bet, the Ministry Christmas will be cancelled.
The reception is held in Vajdahumányvár, the City Literary, and according to the archive, each guest is intended to receive 1,000 HUF each.
According to the press, this will be a very simple reception, as well as only foreign diplomats accredited to Hungary will be official.
These daily bets start with a short welcome, and they end up with a back-up touch.
No Christmas party at all at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture has been celebrated with [orgo] in the relevant departments.
The price of the official record of the hurdle could not be determined in the state department.
Every evening, more than four hundred people were presented to the party, which is organized by the industrialists in the museum.
The forces of the giants are gathering together.
On Friday, their Monday's strike committee will be set up by the League Trade Union and the National Union of Labour Councils.
On Saturday, a major protesting force will be held on Monday - the day of the final vote on the legislation on insurance - and the start of the labor ban.
Action in the field of transport could lead to a significant over-exploitation, which is that it will almost completely stop transport and will strike at BKV for 13 hours.
Friday afternoon, League Trade Unions will present the details of their Monday strike together with the National Federation of the Councils of Jobs.
There is also a League - Moscow strike committee, which will take place on Mondays.
On Saturday, they are hosting a large audience protesting on protests, and as of Monday, the groups joining the strike will stop the work indefinitely if they cannot reach an agreement with the government.
This means that it has not been specified - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Insurance Act - the date of the completion of the initial strike.
If the General Assembly does not yet comply with the Health Insurance Act, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the crisis call.
If the legislation is voted on, then the Committees will sit together and decide on the follow-up.
It is also possible, on Wednesday's agenda, that the Health Insurance Act will only be voted late in the evening at noon.
As a result of the strike starting on Monday, there may be significant upsales in transport: the railways are closed for an indefinite period, and some parts of the public in Budapest, more than half of the Republics of Poland, can stop immediately.
At the same time, there will also be a semi-road roadblocking in many parts of the country.
Several trade unions and civil society organisations have joined to the strike call, and these are being updated on the League's website.
Some organisations have made an unrequited effort and others have made a temporary commitment to work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the free trade union of the MÁV and the Railway Spiders (VDSZ) has not even agreed on a service that is sufficient, but now more people are traveling by rail.
So far, the BKV is being ambushed for 13 hours at the BKV, Budapest between 7 am and 9 pm, with a four-hour strike being held by the League of Electrical and Heat Industry Organisations, 2 and 2-8 hours of work spent by the Agency of the United States of America and the Democratic Organisation of the United States.
The Hungarian Federation is holding a two-hour warning strike at national and alternate times, in the SZEF Sector of the SZF, the Democratic Trade Union (EDSZ) is holding a two-hour warning strike.
The four most important things that the League has put forward are that the government withdraws the regulation on the reform of public security and that a new concept should be issued to society.
The second condition is that the new method of crediting is gradually being introduced next year.
the possibility of entering the system before 2010 at an early retirement age.
The main reason for this action is that the Free Trade Union of Railways (FTA) of the League Trade Union does not accept the offer and other offers of public lines by the Economic and Transport Council.
Political Major: The Hungarian Guard increased the country's risk.
With the support of the Best Hungary Movement this August, the activity of the Hungarian Gárda, which was founded by Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region in a number of respects, according to the Political Capital Risk Analysis Division (Risk Analysis Division).
In the company's "risk warning" it was written: the Hungarian Guard's activity is the biggest political risk that "the already existing ethnic tension between the Gypsy and the non-Gypsy population in Hungary may lead to even violent ethnic clashes in the long run".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is believed to be intended to promote such an act - the research institute has done so.
As it was written, this is due to one of the main omissions of Hungarian political actors: "the public debate on the matter has been passed on to representatives of radical and extreme political groups, who have been able to build political policies to counter the gypsy conflict".
This strengthens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens the extremes, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts occurring - they believe so.
According to the research institute, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, under the influence of the high level of domestic and international media attention, "has significantly deteriorated the belief in Hungary's foreign image, especially in the country's stability and integrity".
It is recalled that since the autumn of 2006, the reconstruction of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary has been increasingly publicised and driven, that more organisations have been formed in Hungary, which have been called the "national self-defence" association itself since the summer of 2007.
"The joint contribution of these consuls is that they define themselves as a non-governmental organisation, while they openly announce the preparation of members, whether they are worthy or not, for the defence (catalyst defense, defence, defence, law enforcement) tasks, in addition to those of the police, the army, or the State, on the basis of the universality".
It noted that this is in line with the way in which society tries to put different political aspirations in civilian hands on the basis of its political and, in some cases, political aspirations.
The emphasis on civil society and the common form of society are not just a way of avoiding legal obstacles to the judicial term, but also a strategy.
It appears that the activities of the Magyar Gárda are a risk factor in the neighbourhood as well.
"In recent months, several neighbouring countries have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a major source of danger, and some transnational political actors in neighbouring countries want to prove their own Hungarian policy on the basis of the reference to the establishment of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region", he added.
According to the researchers, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Central Europe, such as political risks for the region as a whole.
As stated, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard is similar to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, which was announced in January 2007 by the National Union for the Right of Bulgaria (BNU).
In the background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass tensions which have been erupted in one of the parts of Sofia (Krasna Poly) in the background to the formation of the Bulgarian Guard.
BNU has decided on the foundation of the Guard, saying that the purpose of the organisation is "national self-defense".
For the last 17 years, in Bulgaria, there has been a "circulatory terrorist", but the state remains idle and indifferent - says the Political Capital.
He added: the initiative had a lively debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, there is an increase in the risk of ethnic conflicts that some Bulgarian members have announced that opposition is likely to create its own barrier.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard so far shows similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian Roma are otherwise responding to the threat by using their own self-defense - it can be read in the Political Capital Risk Warning.
Attila Juhász, Director of Political Capital, told the Secretariat Office that a risk assessment is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each time they issue their risk assessment, and if they experience what may affect the change in risk, they shall inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
It's not all the same
In Hungary, the law specifically marks the day-to-days, and the day-to-day routine has changed around the holidays, which will make it fewer in the future.
It is not uniform in the EU and in Europe.
The Hungarian legal system differs between national and state and working days.
Working days are mostly linked to church holidays and event events.
We are also celebrating the New Year for us: the last and the first days of the year - the last and the first days of the year are both working - most recently just so that the New Year's New Year's Eve can rest.
Each year, we have eleven single holidays each year.
Monday, 15 and 23 March of March, 1848, the anniversary of the 1956 Revolution.
On 20 August, we will celebrate the state foundation, on 1 May, and on 1 and 2 November, we will remember our family and others who died.
Two days a day, two days a meal, a day a day a day, a day a day a day.
State, national or even religious holidays, according to the calendar, are rare on a weekly basis, the daily shift has become a practice in cases where we work only one day before or after the red holiday.
It is true that last weekend's price is that we do not stay away from work-school on the previous Saturdays.
The exact time for working out the day immediately before or after the festival, for many years, the Minister of Labour has been subject to a special regulation.
The legislation covers all employers and employees employed by them, civil servants and civil servants.
However, it does not affect uninterrupted companies and institutions which are also active on working days due to their jobs.
This year, only around the end of the year, the agenda will be changed: from 24 a.m. to the end of the year, life in the country is almost over, since, according to experience, most people are "sustaining" the days between Christmas and New Year's Day, or they are using their saved freedom for this purpose.
Next week we will have more holidays on the middle of the week or the end, so there will be less workday transfers than this year.
The day of work is about to change so that workers can stay at home for four days.
The Friday of April 26 is going to be a working day in exchange for the Saturday of May 2nd.
The second transfer is linked to the ceremony last 23 years: we will have to work on Saturday, 18 October, instead of Friday, 24 October.
The end of the year, however, will be complete next year, since from December 24 onwards, there will be a non-stop break anywhere, even if the New Year falls on Wednesday.
Six horrifying little things to upset your colleagues.
The emails that we can send, voice mails that we never get, are innocent lies that we can't even see: these are the things that make the day at work look like day-to-days.
The question is whether you get used to the humidties or pick up the gloves and knowingly avoid the misunderstandings that cause others to resist.
A tip.
"Boss, let me tell you something, they're looking for you from the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
Did you miss a murder?
At best, you regret and try to make it right, if you call the marketing department to tell you to pass on the message (this is a less common solution).
Most of the time, it's done with the whole thing with an excuse.
If there's an easy way to escape, it's worth considering what it's like to get moments for your work and to be aware of the need to avoid this.
You want to borrow something that's not yours?
It's less annoying than reaching for a document, for a document, for a document or for your call, and it's nowhere.
Do you care that you put your laptop on the table last night, but you put your foot in the air?
Perhaps you'll expose yourself to the duty that one of your colleagues has to assume to be lost in court?
Don't take anything away from yourself without asking, because I'm right to be late for you to prove their property.
Put aside all the office envelopes, post-it, because it may be a shame if you're running out of time, but you need it as soon as you can.
Are you gossiping about the privacy of your own people?
There is no good way to stop the rumors that have already spread.
Who, who, what, what does he do?
What's that?
Don't tie your notifications (your terms) of your own privacy to everyone else's nose.
If one of them shares the deepest secrets of you, don't go back with his love.
Bury the truth in yourself and do not negotiate it with your colleagues in your absence, even if others have been aware of what you have done.
Is that an indoctrination?
When you call in the office and point to abdominal headaches, you are a patient because your mood is bad, or you seem to be in a bad mood that day; think about the need to do your job, to do your hard work, to do your fixed-term work, to do your job differently.
Don't spot me with your colleagues.
If you know that you're not going to go to the office the next day, or if you know that there's something you need to stay home for, tell your uncle and your boss not to face you the next day.
Singing, slapping, ringing
Did you get involved in the work, but did the anger of the colleagues push you out?
Were you an unwitting witness to a phone call that I should have never been able to tell you?
Ned your work problems with loudness, singing, loud conversation (which you are about to talk about), backfire, constant consolation, loud feeling of dissatisfaction, and noiseful dissatisfaction.
They can all be confusing, even if they don't get involved in a project (in terms of design, design, update).
Is there another person in need?
If there's nothing left, you forgot to send me an important letter, a message, no other blame for your forgetfulness.
It does not rely on the chaos that might prevail in the country, your voice-recording colleagues.
Admit it if you made a mistake, and the rest of you came from behind, and eliminate the herd.
Give me a chance to make up for your mistake, make up for your speech.
Do you want to go home too well in the truth?
Macadamia and slippers: comfortable dress for home, but not for home use.
Don't even wear comfortable free time if your work is allowed.
Don't be a slammer, your colleagues, and do yourself a favor by going into the U.S.A. in ordinary clothes - if you're working, in fact, in ordinary clothes - if you're working, you're going to the U.S.A.
If you're ready, you're not ready anymore.
A discount on the car in the dinner bar.
From the background, there is a special tune: the sound of a violin, which is accompanied by unique effects.
I'm going to roll the volume up the top.
The music has become fast and the first sounds are accompanied by bass, and the women’s disease is a real jewel.
Zagar Wings of Love's voice is on myr.
Home music life has not been a long time for good electronic pops.
But now it looks like there's something else going on while you're listening to the new Zagar record.
Yonderboi's appearance, some of the new and exciting productions coming from the home digital underground are particularly changing in the parallel, and despite the fact that fashion is back on the guitar-set garage rock, the home flash proves that there is a new one during the day.
Zõger Balázs started from Pécs, and you were living in Yonderboi's music as long as - as you could because two jerks didn't get to the same side of the road.
With its work (Zagja) and its music, which combines the elements of jazz, electronic music, pop, but it began to break through when film soundtracks are asked to compete (e.g.
Turkey (Second of Turkey).
The first album of the WA2 magazine in 2002 was published by the 50 most important domestic players and, with the company of Zagar, Yonderboi, Zagar, he called the most unique and marketable domestic trends in the world.
Without a doubt, Zagar and his band became "trend", but most of the time no one asked if they liked the label.
The band reacted as it should: made a new, better record.
Cannot Walk Fly Insstead is now a published album that can open up new paths for them, although the title itself requires a focus on the initial minivans.
In fact, Balázs Zézer was one of the lines of a new music there.
We would be on the air, air, air, but with the lack of music, we have just noticed - the spirit of the time, in order - the sounder guitar, the rock and roll effect.
In this case, the album's historic premiere has been shown by the singer György Ligeti, who is currently working with The Puzzle's orchestra in England.
The album also produced a real radio show, recently from last to last night's popular music, Mr.2 Petőfi began to sneak into the ears of the Wings of Love, as set out by the six home singer ("Underground Divas"), the great tunes of Wings of Love.
All is well (?).
The hvg.hu Züzer Balázs asked about this question.
hvg.hu: This new label now raises the question: How will it continue to be music, what will you play?
Balázs Zõzser: The definition of a complex, this does not mean much to me.
I think there are two types of easy music caste; it's not a mainstream and underground, it's not an alternative and pop, it's a comedy and truthful.
The so-called alternative underground music can be flat, non-tealing, and it is the right thing to do, which is to be sold out to the public.
but with a good pop, it can be a good start.
The host attitude also works in this spirit, regardless of language or country.
hvg.hu: Do you see the difference between the audiences of Hungary and abroad and your music?
Zs.B.: Foreignly, especially from us to the west, there are larger traditions of light music.
There are not only concerts of the age of twelve to twenty, but also older ones.
They are much more concerned with the changes in the music around them, because it is also considered to be a contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the image in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many listen to your music?
Zs.B.: It is a good thing that more and more people go to our concerts.
But we didn't turn into a single market.
For us, music is not for purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the role of the audience is more evident in the concerts when the interaction is already in operation, but it lies only in the impenetrable effects of the present.
Yet, I noticed that if you want to go to the audience, you're no longer interesting from then on.
hvg.hu: How do you want to follow Yonderboi's example?
He's working on his own, and he's been building his career a little further from us.
Zs.B.: We don't really go his way, regardless of whether or not they're trying to explain this to us.
We're just gamers who trust in another musical presence and let it get out of hand.
At first, of course, it was impossible that our work was compared to Yonderboi's music, and more people left his school and left on another road.
hvg.hu: On the top of Mr.2 Petőfi, Wings of Love came first.
Many of these figures were first heard by the Zagar name.
Are you consciously open to the most popular instrument on a wider side?
Zs.B.: We didn't have a plan to write a hit, and then we'd sell the lead.
This is about more than that.
It was meant to be the final of the album, which we have managed to solve the sound orgy that we have done on the record and the harder topics.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
What was the principle of control?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a pancake-like choir.
That's when the idea came to me that this is from the well-sounding solos of the music scene in its home country.
That's how the six-member chorus, called Sena, Kurtzora Edina, Judie Jay, Péterfy Bori, Hodosi Enikő [Neo], Néth Juci, was put together, which was then referred to as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is the song designed or modified by the girls exactly like this?
Zs.B.: The number has already existed in a cyclical version, and then when the disk came together, we thought there was something else that needed to be done with this song.
The timeline stressed that my voice had to be heard.
I used to sing the song that day, and that's what they taught me.
It was all going first and scary spontaneously.
I don't know if it was at the time, but of course they needed the Dévák.
With my voice, you wouldn't have done so forcefully with my voice.
ghg.hu: Both the disc and the concert seemed to have the girl in the background.
No solo (except for Judy Jay's short play), they have no part, they totally sing together and they're not louder than music, although music does not just accompany their songs.
They were in the back of the stage, too.
Is it deliberate?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back was purely because of problems.
It's a fact that we didn't want to play trophies.
The number also means that let's forget about our ego for a little while, where it's coming from, where it's going, let's just let those certain wings, the wings of love blow us out.
I would have liked others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: What was the number of jobs with which?
Zs.B.: At the music comet process, there were actually none, more difficult pieces than the jam.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilem, where I play a competitive piano game, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for the time being he didn't want to work the goove, he's got everything in place, like a puzzle game.
hvg.hu: Who is your favorite number from the new album?
Zs.B.: This always varies with the context and the fact that I've already "absolved" the disk.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Billions are worth billions of dollars because of the tyranny's minority.
It's incredibly gross.
The owner of the Czech Commercial Bank, the French Sociéte Générale bankor, was known as Jerome Kerviel.
For Kerviel, five billion euros were lost.
However, it seems that Kerviel was more than just a big player trying to catch up with his case.
Unlike the rest of the bank, he knew in time the generality of the U.S. mortgage market.
"He said to the police chiefs of police that he had a low impact," he said.
However, as the French Le Monde reported, Kerviel's statement indicates that he made EUR 1.6 billion of his business last year.
It's not like there's a crisis in the world. It's like there's a crisis in the world.
"I just wanted to make money for my bank," he says.
In the summer, half a billion euros were made in the United States.
In fact, the opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news has shown that the problem is low-valued or in the past it has given to clients who are struggling with payment problems with so-called sub-prime mortgages.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerel didn't believe in this, and she made me a good horse.
Its annual profit amounted to 1.6 billion euros.
"I didn't know how to report it," admits Kerviel, and he adds that it didn't hold anything.
In fact, he acknowledges that his reports have been forged in such a way that it cannot come out.
Even when Erex's stock exchange began to question its transactions, he managed to trick his boss.
Valuation
she's afraid of everything?
No, I don't.
"I thought it was just the fact that I'm making 1.6 billion for the bank and it'll reassure them."
Where were you going to do that?
Its position has been reasonably achieved.
After completing the Lyons year, he worked from York at the Société Gérérale bank in Société.
Her annual salary was around $11,000.
Two years later, he was a broker and became a self-employed driver with a salary of $90,000 a year in 2005.
Nevertheless, he knew that he would never seek as much as others.
"In fact, in my first conversation, I knew that they were looking at me wrongly.
My end, for my professional and personal career," said Kerviel to the detectives.
The first great success was not long after its arrival.
He asked for Alliance's shares because during the bombings in London, half a billion of these shares fell into a billion dollars.
it started a lavia - it said more.
As long as he's here, we'll leave you alone.
"It's like a snowball," he told the next man.
But your bosses are supposed to know everything or guess what.
"As long as I made some money, "they've gone blind."
Only that there was a blow at the beginning of the year.
He lost a billion dollars in one day.
He wanted to cover for me this afternoon this afternoon.
When he started working on Monday, he was no longer in the bank.
And the bank announced a couple of days later that he made five billion dollars for it.
How did they know?
His freedom made him suspicious.
"I only spent four days last year.
The guy who doesn't have freedom is a broker who doesn't want anyone to be able to access his reports," said Kerviel.
3 hells of a match to get 3 bits.
The Czech Government ministers have signed an overall operation programme with representatives of the European Commission, of which the United States could make EUR 14 billion in the coming years (around 3 billion days).
From 2007 to 2013, the Czech Republic is about half of the total amount.
The seven operational programmes in the regions cost around 12 billion dollars.
Czech companies can raise around 100 million years of age from the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money, 150 billion, is for transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and accounts for 22% of the funds available to it.
These funds will increase the state's base for transport infrastructure, which will be managed next year by the age of 9 billion.
Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme helps entrepreneurs and companies to earn their assets for innovation enterprises.
Companies should also aim for new innovations, industrial research, but also for better solutions.
As far as EU funds are concerned, the Republic of the United States is among the least successful in the new countries.
The 20th annual prison sentence of the ex-president of Nicaragua was approved by the Court of Justice.
The Supreme Court of Haiti approved twenty years of imprisonment to Arnold Alemaman, the former President of the country, who was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud at USD 100 million (up to EUR 1.8 billion).
However, he was subsequently released from prison and was in a house arrest in his suburbs near the capital.
The fact that a former leader of this Central American country from 1997 to 2002 is returning behind bars is not clear, according to AP News.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Perez, it will then be up to the President of the Court of Justice of the Court of Justice to decide whether or not to leave Alemaa's order to stay at home or to return to prison.
Four years ago, the court proved to Alemán that government funds were often referred to the accounts of foreign companies in Taama.
These entities and their account numbers were actually related and closest to their relatives and families.
Some of these funds were then awarded to a foundation based on the election campaign of Alemaa in 2001.
They approved our budget.
That's right.
Public finances have been adopted.
What is this budget for?
the first government to bring together, adopted by a coalition majority, without any support.
This year passed through this year with the support of social democracies, since Prime Minister Sobotka and the Nordic Social Democrats could not allow it to be rejected.
Unlike the vote before the vote on the vote, unlike the vote on the government's lack of confidence, no drama occurred this time.
The House has adopted this principle, although it has excluded the most effective law.
It's a certain contradiction.
All governments are in and out of each chapter and item of the budget, whether or not they are like it or not.
The budget is an essential element of policy, but it is hidden behind the struggles of government and opposition.
This is more grateful to you today, which is why you get much more attention in the media.
Policy debates are much more important to the public than mere numbers.
The central government deficits of the last social democracies are three shortcomings, which the 2008 budget cannot solve at the same time:
First of all, the high proportion of the law on compulsory, so-called 'trust fund', which means not only pensions but also social benefits, which last year was rejected by the 'coalisation' of Čsed and KSŠÄM, before the elections.
The first deficiency is the consequence of deficit management.
The third limit is the deficits of public finances, the deficits of the budgets of cities and vehicles.
However, the greatest risk is not the government deficit.
It shall be kept under public and relative control.
Timed bombs are the deficits of the budget for cities and vehicles.
This is the first time that they can make money other than money from taxes, taxes and bank loans for other investments, and most often they have issued bonds that have been disproportionately indebtednessd by their Town Halls.
Over the past year, these debts have been repaid by mass sales of energy and other distribution units from the State to private households.
They do not currently have such a source.
Where we rely only on official and verifiable facts, we shall conclude that:
Like the rest of the world, our economy has been going through a phase of growth that the United Nations Social Democratic Party has been praising.
It has been possible for its governments to correct public finances.
Instead, the country was rather sent to all these places.
The other countries have managed with two exceptions, such as Hungary, USA, Pakistan or Egypt, far more rational than China.
This is, first and foremost, the essential importance of the primary governments.
We belong to countries, which are at least the least threatened by poverty.
This is why, for example, there is no need for major social programmes, which have, in the last few years, become completely redundant in terms of GDP.
Although it has been possible this year to cut off some of the meaningless populist expenditures approved before the elections, even if there will not be a ban on retirement and pension reform in the near future, any policy in this country will actually cease to exist, and whoever governs, this will only be a civil servant.
A little too much might be possible for the majority of tax money from government policies to general retirement and for social benefits to become a standard currency.
This is why the budget for this year cannot be revolutionary, but it can only stop the imposition of this kind of payment by way of trust fees.
The 70 billion deficit scheduled for 2008 would be completely superfluous if the previous governments had not lost everything that they could have done in the last few years.
If it is not true that it is true that we should become mere officials of the government, then we must be willing and calm to prepare for further reform, not too strong, knowing that the state will only give out what it can obtain from taxes and taxes.
This is the only way to ensure that balance is achieved in a timely manner.

The banks are willing to solve the present system of things.
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom and the central banks of the United States of America have decided to fight the money market battle together.
Money markets are thus costing more than one million dollars through the stock market.
On a flat-rate basis, the interest rate is increased on the market for which you can borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed makes $40 billion available to the stock market and makes another twenty-four available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time that the central banks of each country have agreed to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the 12th attacks.
"This step should address the greatest economic importance, i.e. the lack of free capital that banks would lend," said the Greens, on behalf of Mr. Bernard Baumohl, of the Ecomic's Directorate-General, in his report.
"The concerted action of central banks in the United States has reduced the probability of a recession from 65 percent to about fifty percent," said Baumohl.
Those who have already lost 60 million dollars in the United States because of non-reimbursable loans.
Other billion-dollar losses are still due to be expected.
"Central banks may be concerned about what might happen if they have decided in favour of such a procedure," says Kieran Davies, head of the ABN Amro.
It seems that the situation is really wrong," he did.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves are not able to access the market, they will also be more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce the need and the US economy to bring about a recession with the potential impact of global economic growth.
The central banks then decided that it was not possible to reduce the so-called LIBOR, the selling price in London, which is used for the exchange of money.
This meant that banks were always afraid of the use of mutual money, despite the fact that the banks of the United States, Canada and the United States of America also decreased their interest rates a few times in the autumn.
"It will have a similar effect to this further drop in interest," she says to the Reuters News Agency, Greg Salvaggio, from Tempus Connecting.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks contributes to the resolution of the world, which does not solve the fundamental problem of the collapse of the US real estate market.
Klaus: The ecological environments are incredibly controversial.
Global climate change is currently affecting the developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again gave an opinion on the problem of global warming.
This time, he criticised the international context of the United Nations Climate Change Commission in Bali.
The book of the Blue Scriptures, which was presented in Vienna, is not the wise one, it was said that the archaeologists were unbelievable.
It is not only the context of the conference that is unacceptable, which is a special mix of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between rhetoric and reality that accompany it.
"That debate is an absolute necessity to the general public, it is only a word-to-word trap, which is a substitute for the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of the Czech President's book, he stressed that it was very important for him to address his subject, which is why he was so committed to this subject.
He expressed his satisfaction at the fact that the Bible is also published in German, because, as he says, "I often just meet with my opinion on the Caribbean".
In other words, the opinion of the locals may not be distorted.
Klaus reminded me that even though he is not a climaxologist, he believes that it is necessary to prescribe such a book on the basis of a basic condition.
Since it is possible to monitor and manage professional expenses as an academic in statistics and as an economist, it has also been the case as an academic.
The conclusion of the book is that the climate is constantly changing, i.e. its changes are normal and that the warming of the planet is not in any doubt that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious, so that they do not constitute a danger and that efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, ineffective and inevitably costly.
In addition, as a human being with experience in the field of totalitarianism, the unproven opinions consider it unacceptable to impose on others, which is perceived as a dangerous freedom restriction.
In these questions, he explained that "it is not a simple defence of the environment, but a militant envirocentalism, which does not take into account the costs and benefits of it".
This is something that Klaus already spoke about in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 000 could not replace the licence period.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and were unable to replace their original licence on time, the validity of which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when you can still request the exchange that the agencies will be able to issue the new licence in due time the year in question.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the new year, there will be a thousand drivers driving without a right.
According to the Offices, the licence has not been replaced primarily by those who no longer want to drive.
While epidemics mean a sharp fall in interest in licence exchanges, the capital offices have been flooded with requests for licence exchanges, which has increased their interest this year.
The chief official office adopts about 2,000 people every day.
It's about half an hour to stand in line.
However, the license has not yet been replaced by some 140,000 drivers.
The issue of a new licence lasts 20 days.
However, the new licence may be issued with a five-day extension period.
If necessary, the driver must still pay an additional 500 kroner.
Drivers who are unable to carry out the mandatory licence for the year-end and are on their way under an invalid licence are under threat from January.
The sinner must pay up to two thousand crowns.
However, the police may also arrange the outburst by agreement.
In the event of an administrative irregularity, the penalty shall be 2500 years.
Based on the previous information received from the Town Hall, anyone who does not travel anywhere may also be fined.
It is said that it could cost up to 30000 people a year.
The Ministry has called on the agencies to be generous and to lay down rules.
However, according to Karel Hansel, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, tens of thousands of fines do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the licence is a document in which a person can or does not kill a person.
This is not a personal identification document, which should be valid for everyone.
Those who don't want to drive anymore should drop the license.
To take or, as a matter of fact, to pass on to the appropriate authority as soon as possible.
By the end of the year, the licences issued between 1964 and each other are no longer valid.
However, drivers need to gradually change the other driver's license plates.
Documents from 1994 to 2000 may be replaced for a further period of three years.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall only expire in 2013 at the latest.
Mr. Hanzelka said it's about 2.6 million more.
The court has prohibited the imprisonment of detectives who joined the Leavedyccchel.
Josef Opava and Petr Kocelaík were police officers who were suspected of being associated with David Berdych's crime, who were sentenced to 13 and 10 years of prison.
This is the case with the highest judicial final effect in Prague, which has reduced one of them by two years for one of them.
The Detectives of the Prague Department of Crime were actually under threat from 14 and 12 years of age.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, the review can only be requested by the Supreme Court.
Although Mr. Berdychet is also being identified in this same case, he is waiting only for the first judgment.
In other cases, he has already been given more than 16 years in total.
You can't do this anymore.
In January, the Court of Justice found 19 persons guilty of kidnapping attacks, of which 16 appeals were brought today by the Supreme Court.
Most of the defendants rejected the accusations at the start of the investigation because it was a matter of speculation.
According to the Central Chechnya Senate, after an agreement with Berdycch, the police member provided information from political sources, covered the individual robberies and helped to avoid bringing any person into custody.
The gang gave up 30 percent of this heist to Opava and Kocca all of them.
The document refers to the crimes committed by the gang between 1999 and 2001.
In particular, it is a robbery that has often suffered serious damage to health, but also abuses of civil servants' authority and non-authorisation.
Since the police in the Houses found illegal guns, steel bullets, laser control or a machine gun during their stay, the police found them.
The gang is charged with tens of thousands of crowns of armed robbery.
At this time, the courts have already been legally convicted of other attacks by Berdych and many others.
Other members of Berdych's environment are also testifying in other proceedings before the court, some of which have not yet been brought to justice.
The first trial has so far been avoided by the Tomáš Puta and Maroš Šulej, who are in pre-trial custody in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their prosecution to the United States of America.
The price per child exchange: $12 million.
For children who are born, Igor Veleba, Igor Veleba, the legal lawyer of the damaged families, demands a pension payment of 12 million years of age, plus legal expenses.
Each one has three people, each has two people and one for each.
The house offers up to 20 grand per parent.
His legal representative, Ondjej Dostola, disagrees in principle with Dostola's proposal.
"We refuse such a charge, it's too much," said Dostal after the trial today.
"In order to deliver an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an opinion on the opposition.
We will determine whether there is any usable value at all.
But we do believe that this will be a matter of tens of thousands," Dosal stressed.
According to the figure, the four parents should move between 10 and 20 000 KCs.
At the time of the case, the Jablofilov family wanted a second age for every month, until he raised his own biological damage.
She served her brother the legal trial on the basis of which the compensation negotiations were conducted, thanks to the Prague Mosol University Hospital.
The child’s wife’s psychologist and psychiatrist, however, seems to have suffered various degrees and depths of emotional harm and weight.
The emergency was more well tolerated, even if it was found to be something else that they did not change the new life change.
Women are the worst to deal with the current recent trauma and what is happening right now, they are summarising with the content of the Veleba.
On December 9 of the year, 1.6 and Nikolat were replaced by their mother's blues in Ttteebíč.
Last week, the child returned to blood parents - Nikola Čermák in Píbyslaque, Veronika Libor in Brož and Jaroslava in Trojanova in Jabloñov.
Vysočina's leader, Miloš Vystrčil, gave the families 10 million kroons to pay for their expenses at the end of the afternoon, resulting from the mistake of the Tébíčské Palace, which is run by the government.
All Czech hospitals are subject to compulsory insurance under the legislation of the Czech Republic.
In the event of a mistake, they must be in the reserve, otherwise they may request the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far approved a relatively low compensation for people, the amounts have been calculated on the basis of a few hundred thousand, or, otherwise, a few dozen crown tables.
Ask for a confirmation of the Kingdom of Vásasso.
Bolek Polívka has failed to file a case against the Kingdom of Vásasso.
According to the Court of Justice of the Ostava, even though he was the first one to use the capital of the king of Italy, the project was developed by the team around Tomám Harabiš, the co-operating actor.
Polika was not involved in the trial today.
Legally speaking, however, the case is not likely to end and the case will appeal.
"The debate is that Mr Harabiš and his team are close to the popularity of Bolek Politvika," said Politvika's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the All-King of the World is always the actor-commic in his mind.
The opinion was shared by Mr Harabiš.
"Morning work is behind us today.
Find money and find things," he said.
He says that money is money.
" Years later, they realized that the project was successful and could gain something from it.
They want to move away from our work," he said.
It's a competitive business.
According to the Court of Justice, the king of Poland was the first to use his name as a member of the Police Department.
In 1993 Radoslav Brzobohat was crowned by Radoslav Brzobohat.
At the time, however, this was not related to the purpose of establishing a fissionary kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came forward with the idea of issuing past passports.
The first academic operation was turned into a business and an economic activity, followed by the establishment of Harabiš for the Kingdom of Vássko.
In 1997, with the combined name and signature of the Politárka, he offered discounts for his farm and theatre lectures on passports and even their owners.
Who is involved in the throne?
She also mentioned today that Harabiš himself used only the idea that Polítka used to publicise his reputation.
"Boleslav's political popularity must have helped the project of the Great Kingdom," said the judge.
However, he added that the project was about Harabiš and his team.
Today's cooperation between the two parties continued until 2000, when Harabiš Politka organized an official co-operation in Vsetín.
Since then, however, there has been a build-up of disputes between the Politika and Harabiš, which have relied on the release of "Queen I. Boleslav forever".
On the initiative of Harabiš, the leading role in the kingdom was transferred to Jarmila Šláko as a mother rule.
In 2002, Polívka Harabiš and his colleagues were subsequently brought to justice by the Court of Justice today.
The fight for the throne and for the half of the girl could be brought into the debate by Harabiš.
From now on, it should be a new king.
The details and the date have not yet been published.
"we don't want to make a fool of anything.
This should be something like a Slovacko rule.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Police Commissioner may also contact you," Harabiš did.
The 277 SW 1.6 VTi Peugeot test: a conjecture of conjecture.
To be honest, I never liked Peugeot 206.
Its lost properties are nothing special, and we can often describe the quality of change, management and production as understated.
But the market already has its origin, Peugeot 207 is far better.
And the SW is one more thing, and that's all I have left to think about.
When I tested Peugeot's 207 classic tackbacks, I might as well have reported in the back seat to the head.
This complaint is now over, because the combination of carnations means that the two-metre-high giants no longer exist in this respect.
Gaseous in the world.
I'll be able to get through the interior soon enough, so I don't repeat it many times.
It is a relatively good design where my only condition is for the poor console.
I'd like to offer you something more unique to offer if you already have a nice look at.
The seats are comfortable, and where are the times when we complained about shorts or armrests in the seat?
The lateral drive against the 206 model has also significantly improved.
In fact, there is also an indication of the increase in the size of the nebula.
The other side of the head is no longer visible.
Bags in the trunk.
The main place of the package is the motor vehicle.
I need to appreciate this very well-practice (also thanks to the exitable back window) and a spacious space.
The empty spaces are equipped with parking tyres, which are ideal components.
They're not in the road, they're sticky, and they're able to handle a lot of things.
But we're gonna need some time at the volume.
On the basis of these tables, the basis is set at 428 l, which is the average value on the contrary to competition.
On the other hand, it is not the easiest kind of vehicle - compared to Skoda Fabia Combi.
Compared to the 207 SW with the brand new product in Mmada Bolesla, it is concluded that Peugeot is well behind the considerable number of 52 litres.
For a holiday abroad or for the placing of a trailer, this value is almost as good as it is.
But if I need to mention the additions, then I have to mention the almost completely straight floor after the second row of backslide or the very low threshold.
120 horsepower in line.
Our two-wheeled car is equipped with a 1.6-litre, 88-engine-powered, rotary engine.
And to tell you the truth, this is how it should look to the millennia, which is going to hit the face-to-face boxback.
Nice, low-fat and head-on.
If we compare it with the equivalent of Škoda, which often seems to have been filled with rags in its exhaust, I can therefore do that.
Message price
The car price is not cheap.
However, we need to remind you that we have a spacious interior and we have a very good motor.
The car is still leaving for 329 900 Kč with a four-wheeled foreign engine.
The car is from 410 990 Kč, which is already quite a lot.
The tested specification will save the equipment with an additional 80 000 Kč.
As long as we still have headbags, automatic climates, automatic wipe-outs, rear windows we also had electrical remote control....
The car will cost 549 900 K.C.
It's a lot, but it calculates the additionality of Faba, and it gets a very similar result.
So all we have left is the decision on the side of the line.
The integration of Slovak students in the British schools has also taken place.
In the United States, there is an increasing number of children in Eastern Europe who have caused many locals to continue their local school development.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans is currently under a number of conditions.
British citizens have already registered in cases where disputes between children of immigrants and domestic residents have been violently violent.
The problems with the integration of Eastern European children have been well addressed in a North East, where there are conflicts between the places of origin and Slovak immigrants.
Inter-student conflicts and bonds are already in the relationship of parents.
The situation has so far been that in Chatham, the police arrested a Slovak woman who, with iron rod, pursued a ten-year-old student.
The culprit defends himself by insulting him with a racist stylus.
The police also had to act after two twelve-year-old girls attacking Slovak immigrants.
The sign claims that the man was embroiled with racist comments and threw with stones.
"When we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the parking lot and started spitting on us.
When I said that this would stop, he would strike us with apples and paws, and then he revealed his naked ass," the mother of Slovak students described the recent recent incident to The Times.
Both sides have complaints.
One resident of the country designated disputes on immigrants in eastern Europe as a survival struggle.
These cases suggest that the situation between locals and immigrants in the UK is becoming tense.
In Britain, 70 000 job-seekers are registered as Slovakian workers.
About 30 thousand Slovak students come to English schools.
Cuba is the island of the Caribbean region of Cuba.
For those visitors, freedom is an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this may be the case if you answer correctly.
The sand and the white coasts, they're fun or they're at sea, they're like a fish.
Plums and all inclusive with a pool of pizzas, ice creams, or creamy cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
In the Caribbean, you can find this in full and at least in the list.
However, one island has much more to find, and this is Cuba, the largest and largest island of the Great Great Acillas.
Under them, Cuba was the stronghold of their American conquests in Cuba.
Columbus called the most beautiful place a human person has ever seen.
Havana has become a warehouse and a transitory that the Spanish have robbed and transported to Europe in the United States.
Next was the American era.
The Nacional Hotel was built in the 20th century.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the U.S. Mafia, was founded by one of the U.S. Mafia, since everything that was a criminal offence in the United States (mainly alcoholism) is welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among their guests
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
When storms were built in Havana, on the high-speed roads, the 50s of the last century became a culture of changed cars.
Ernest Hemings acquired property in San Francisco de ía, not too far from Havana, and he had his own yacht in Cojímar.
The Bodeguita del Medio walls are inspired by the signing of the stars and politicians of the American show business.
Today?
The Havana Bodeguita wall can be provided with a handbook for you too.
The expensive Nacional Hotel, however, wishes you a nice cup of tea for yourself.
And the 50's is a cult car for today's journey in Havana, because your former export has already been lost in this salty and cold weather since your son and son were once exported.
The oldest part of Havana, however, is not exactly as beautiful as it is there anywhere else.
Other places are more beautiful than, for example, Trinidad.
The fact that tourism provides all the money needed, it has been developed on a road to development.
Over the past 15 years, not only have new hotels been built in Havana, but also in Varader, on the coast of Holguin Province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers another unique taste, which is primarily appreciated by train drivers.
Out of their many plantations, the sugar cane was transported to the canteens by steam and motorcycles.
Their motorcycles have not been renewed for many years, which means that the machines that operate there are visible, and the others are only visible elsewhere in other ways.
Where are we going?
The most recent places in Cuba are not missed by most visitors.
There's not much to write about either Varad or Havana.
Let's just remind ourselves that there is a museum in Hemingway where we have already mentioned and that anyone who loves the song should not miss his visit to this museum.
One of the most outstanding parts of the Viyales Valley Cuba is on the island.
The pompous vegetation grows from medicament.
Beech breeds, mammal mountain peaks and rocks rise steeply from the valley under the valley and in their fields with fertile crops, which also cover the erected slopes and dense vegetation.
The valley is a place where the best quality Cuban tobacco is produced.
In its final form, one of the Havana cigarettes can be connected to a visit to the vehicle.
Some may also find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chicago episode was filmed there.
Trinidad
Old town, which was founded shortly after the island colonization of the Spanish.
Famous fame and glory are slave and commodity trade.
The economy is not a very large city in its essence and its monumental nature.
Over the four centuries, there has been no change in the colonial ideals that had a significant impact on the later dual settlements.
In contrast, Trinidad between the Esambray plain and the sea is a strange place that even in the 50th century of the world, there were no roads that would have linked this country with the rest of the country.
That particular isolation helped to keep him from being outside.
None of them were there, and that's why they didn't break down, everyone was excited that there was a roof under his head.
If you have more than one second to visit Trinidad, you will be able to see the places around you than the Sea of Playa Ancón or the Valley of Sugar Factory.
And then all of them go to the land de la Música, which is after dark, where the music only goes down from day to day.
Coa
Some people consider the town in the east of Cuba to be the other city.
This opinion must be influenced by the way itself.
Both of the roads from Guantanamo have to overcome high and isolated mountains, and the human activity leads to a very critical nature.
Due to the uninhabited nature of Cuba, UNESCO has taken the World Heritage List to Cuba.
Here is its best chocolate, the city has the Cross of Columbus (in fact, after a hundred years of sailing the Columbus) and the hill where the former waits and now the El Castillo hotel stands, some of which are the most well known El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, Sierra Measro plains, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Iceland de Pinos, Tropicana cabara, Cardidad del Cobra Cuban Pare, Santer, African religion, which is believed to be the offspring of the former slaves, all of this can be written.
What he says right is better to see it at once.
The Afghanistan allies are passive, they are the Americans.
The United States' mission in Afghanistan is also affected by a lack of military and necessary security.
According to Robert Gates, NATO should select specific plans for the next few years.
The Afghan mission is not in the sense that the leaders of the countries in Edinburgh, Scotland, which have units in the south of the country have agreed to do so.
In addition to the lack of resistance to the Taliban movement, the two participating countries also discuss further plans and roles for allies.
While the United States, assisted by Minister of Defence Robert Gates, has made a greater contribution this year to NATO troops, the United States considers the strengthening of the Afghan Government and the strengthening of development aid to be a priority.
"Afghanistan development is consistent, but military power can only be a part of the law.
The other population will be able to move ahead with economic and development," said British Minister of Defence Des Browne to the BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. government, the activity of the Afghan uprisings is, according to the United States, the last five years are the strongest.
The number of acts of violence increased by 27 per cent compared to last year and by 60 per cent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, around one quarter of them in the southern regions.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their time in the way and in the equipment of the troops.
In particular, they asked for more mates, soldiers and men to teach the Afghan troops.
"We really need to think seriously about our main goals for the future and how we can achieve this," Gates.
On the whole, Jaap de Hoop, the NATO Secretary-General, also spoke today.
"I'm not happy about what's going on in Afghanistan on Earth and on the ground.
We have about forty percent of the soldiers and equipment that we need, and that is very little," said De Hoop to the Reuters News Agency at the end of a three-day talk with the Japanese government in USA.
Out Passive
There have also been disputes between countries over the last few months as to whether all all the allies are providing the euro in Afghanistan.
Russians are critical of their passivity.
"The Germans are in relatively large numbers in Afghanistan.
However, they have been introduced in areas where violence and combat requirements are the least, so they are not as high as in the south and east of the country," said Gates.
This week, the UK of Sunday called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan Logs: The Germans will play while our boys are fighting," says Sun in the photograph of the German soldiers playing tennis in the past.
The German Bild went on counter-attack, and a British team launched a photo of his runt-off in the south of Afghanistan.
The government will reach a single bridge in 2009.
The state debt of the year 84.000 is coming all the way to the end of the year.
By the end of the second quarter, he reached the age of 84,2.7 billion.
This year, the government plans to borrow 159,2 billion years' worth of loans.
However, at the beginning of October, the Ministry reduced this plan by 8 billion years of age, thanks to the better development of public finances.
The US government reached the age of 842.7 billion at the end of September.
During the six months of this year, this increased by 40.2 months.
However, from June to June, he fell by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance has thus today verified the government debt data from the beginning of today.
Each Czech Republic has more than 84 000 years of age.
Last year, the state owed more than 11 months of age to the state.
"It seems that thanks to the next year's second deficit, the one- trillion kroner limit would only exceed the 2009 limit.
In the following year, all will be surrounded by a billion and a billion crowns," said David Marek, an analyst of Patria Finance, to the iHNed.4 server.
You can see this analysis by ï Finance, Vladimír Pikora: "We can cross a billion.
As soon as, for the moment, the same depends on what it is.
If it were to be proved that the situation in the world is changing, policies would be willing to save more money, which could continue to exist until 2010.
But I'm not assuming that change," he said.
Growthal pipes
Government debt is made up of central government debt, which is mainly due to the accumulation of government deficits.
The general government accounts for the government by currency, by government debt, by direct loan, or by e.g. by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state has increased by 3 billion this year to 719.4 billion crowns.
The state's debt has increased by EUR 123.3 billion for the time being.
By the end of September, some of the alleged public debt reached the age of 80,3 billion and decreased from January to 13.7 billion.
The average maturity of the government debt decreased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual growth rate increased by 13 per cent in the first quarter, which is certainly quite much compared to the progress of the economy.
Clearly, the increase is mainly generated by the bond, where the increase is 20%.
It's wrong to be a woman in the economy, but on the other hand it shows that you will be trading, if you will be here in the reform," said Pikora.
prior to waiting
As far as financing is concerned, and the government's 2007 review of public debt shows that the government was planning to raise a loan of 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning, however, the Ministry reduced the plan by 8 billion years of age thanks to the better development of public finances.
The principal amount is the government deficit, which is likely to reach the assumed age of 91.3 billion this year instead of the figure of 76 billion.
In addition, it is planned to have a total of 13,9 billion years of age, ten billion reserves for the payment of pensions, 43 billion years for the financing of the government debt and 1.8 billion for the repayment of loans of the European Investment Bank.
Today, the teacher appears before a court in China for a name given to a teddy bear.
He sentenced the second teacher in Sudan to 15 days in prison and to leave the country for attacking Islam.
The British woman has been accused of being named Mohamed by 6-7 students, but Islam's religion prohibits any illustration of her prophet.
Such an action may be justified by a curfew.
The 54-year-old woman in Britain, who was arrested in her own home by the teacher of the University School of Karúm, was arrested on the basis of paragraph 125 of the Sudan Inquiry Code, accused of insulting Islam and oblivion, after the student's mothers have challenged her at the Ministry of Education in Sudan.
The story began in the second half of the year when the teacher asked her 6- to 7-year-old students to choose a name for the class's top teddy bear.
"All four children suggested: Haszan, Abdullah and Mohammad, among other things," says Robert Boulos, Director of the School.
Out of 23 votes in favour, 20 children chose the last name of Mohammad.
Mohamed is the name of the prophet of Islam, but also a very common name in Sudan.
Next, they wrote a joint diary with the picture of the bear and "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself has not been branded with that name, but the whole thing lies in the fact that any representation of the prophet is an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a colleague of Muslims teaching at the same school, said that he knew them well and that the teacher would never have done anything to violate any religious belief.
The teacher's many students agree with this opinion. They believe that the teacher is "very good with children" and "he never talks about religion in his mind".
Remember, there are 14 different types of writing in the UK and the second most popular first name in Mohammad’s Great Britain.
This is often a way of expressing the Prophet’s honor by Muslim families. (This name is often given to the first-born child of the family.)
But what rules apply to the use of the first name?
Can you get this food for example in a game?
That is clearly the point of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the future of the future at the last summit on Wednesday.
The end result: failure.
In close convergence between the Serbs and the Kosovo Albanians, the second and last meeting on Wednesday morning on the future status of the separatist future in Baden, Austria.
"Unfortunately, the parties did not reach an agreement on the status," she stated.
The U.S. Ambassador, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region was at "risk" and encouraged Belch and Pristin to keep them in line after the discussions.
"In the near future, there is no need to be pressured, but a very difficult period is coming," he added, thanking for "the existence of public tensions".
The communication will end on 10 December.
On Mondays, you will visit Serbia and Kosovo with the European Union, the United States of America and Russia.
The future of the 90 percent of the Albanian nation may be uncertain as Ischinger, Wisner and the Russian mediator, Aleksandr Bocan-Harchenko, will report to the United Nations Council by 10 December.
The meeting in Baden, near Vienna, reported the sixth and last session of the negotiations, since last year the United Nations has given the troika a second transmission last August.
The Americans and Europeans believe that their communication mission will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already been defeated in the Security Council in the matter of Kosovo's independence, insist that negotiations continue beyond the expiry of the deadline.
"Russia was committed, and that remains the negotiated solution, in favour of the compromise," said Bocan-Harchenko.
A one-sided Treaty statement?
After 8 years under the control of the United Nations, Kosovo, the American authorities believe that independence under EU supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina said that her presidency would be one-sided if the United Nations Council did not decide for her benefit.
It would continue to support greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we are unable to reach an agreement" - announced by the President of the State of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden region where "the last round of negotiations" has been held since Monday.
Hashim Taci, former commander of the Kosovo Resurrection and the future commander of the Range, also expressed his objection.
He did, however, change the idea that he had of an automation of the Interior "it would be a continuation of the past of murder and deportation."
"Domino effect."
The Serbian President, Boris Tadic, considered that the compromise was still possible and the Albanian majority in Kosovo warned about the consequences of a one-sided cry for membership.
In fact, Belgium is still afraid of "domino-efficiencies" due to the recent wars of independence in the 1940s in an unstable country.
"For the most part, this does not exclude the possibility of a compromise," said Tadc.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation once again stated that the decision would be the only decision for the United Nations Council, where the Russian Federation has a right of defence.
"The Kosovo Parliament will be the last word."
"The only solution to be adopted by the Council of the Council", said the Serbian Prime Minister, Mr Vojislav Kostunica.
"The two lasted for two years.
They must end the same way they started: in the Council of the Council."
Fatmir Sejdiu said to journalists that "the last word will be for the Kosovo Parliament." He said that for the Albanians the one-sided cry of independence is on the basis of "conconciliation" with the truth.
Common position calls for a settlement between Israel and Palestine between Israel and Palestine.
President George Bush announced on Tuesday that Israel and Palestine had finally agreed to sign a joint declaration at the opening of an international conference in Annapolis, England.
According to Bush, the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmer and the Palestinian President, Mahmud Abbhass, it is agreed that they will start negotiations on the final settlement of the 60-year trial among their peoples.
Mr. Bush, in the presence of the two presidents, promised that all possible ways of supporting them would be possible to sign the "peace" Treaty in 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must stop "terrorist networks", while the United States must cease its colonist activities - declared Bush and reminded both parties of its obligations regarding the "Pacific Agenda" adopted in 2003 and the "Pacific Agenda".
The Head of the House of the House stressed that the goals of the negotiations between the Palestinian Authority and Israel led by the Antser "are the signing of a treaty that poses a problem in all matters, including central issues".
The latter concern the three minor problems at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian debate: the future borders of Palestine, the situation of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees who live in the territory of today’s Israeli state during the 19th conflict.
After the President of the United States, speaker Abbas insisted that future negotiations be "global and deep" and affect all areas of regulation, such as "Jerusalem, asylum, borders, colonies, water and security".
Next, Olmert, who took the lead, promised that the future negotiations would be "intermediate and continuous", and he will have reason to "end in the rest of 2008".
By the end of Wush 2008, he set out the next Palestinian and Israeli "two-state vision".
Judah-Arab said that Bush had given this promise before he could have been involved in the conference.
Saudi Arabia (which was most likely to book its participation in the United States of America) has created a plan with the support of all Arab countries to allow peace for China if it withdraws from all Arab territories, including East Jerusalem, during the 1967 war.
Annapolis "is an alternative to the history of the Central East, especially because it captures the problem at its root and focuses on central issues", considers the Saudi Prince's response to the Saudi Arab newspaper.
According to the D.A., the police are not responsible.
What happened last day?
As is usually the case with this kind of thing, the official expression and the rumors conflict with each other.
Did that happen?
According to the first cases of investigation initiated by the National Police General Service (IGPN), after a few minutes, after 17 hours, a car went off the street of Louis-Michel in Villiers-le-Bel.
"the car patrol, so he didn't take action. He went 40-50 km/h, without sirening," we found out about the check-out.
The two unmanned young "high-speed" was driven by a green, "not in the official register, therefore not for use on the road" (see below) with Kawasaki branded engine.
"Because the right-hand rule has not been respected, the engine has hit the left-hand side of the police car," says a cop.
The results of the alcohol test carried out on the passenger by the vehicle were secondary to that carried out on the vehicle.
It's the power of the impact that the front is stuck, the windshield star is broken, and the backrest is blocked.
Public Prosecutor Pontoise, Marie-Hérèrse de Girry, announced yesterday that he had been entrusted with the fact that he was 'indicted for the lack of manslaughter and assistance' by IGPN and the Public Directorate for Val-D'Oise County.
In a press conference this afternoon, the D.A. stated that, at the current stage of the IGPN investigation, the responsibility of the police could not be excluded.
According to the D.A., three witnesses who were questioned on the night of the accident confirmed "the story of the crash, according to which the bulge has arrived relatively quickly on the left side of the car."
Yesterday, from a thread, which was driven by the wheelchairs on the road, it was shown that it was in a collision and that it went together until the windmill was able to contain it.
The vehicle is reserved for technical testing.
The two victims did the police investigation last night.
What happened immediately thereafter?
In two fires, Villiers-le-Bel's rumor was that the persecutors quickly left the scene without helping the two young people.
In this regard, IGPN is a cautious word, but it excludes the police from doing "any serious mistake".
"This is the hardest part of the investigation, which requires even more thorough investigation, and this requires caution," we have learned from the source of the literature.
The Liberian met a witness who reported a few moments after the accident.
One of the windows of his apartment looks exactly at the location.
"The brother-in-law, who is a hospital nurse, we immediately went down to try to revive them," says the witness.
"There was nothing we could do."
Then he noticed, "A man who was so upset and limp.
The other two tried to revive one youngster and the other one tried to revive the other one."
The tensions of the two youngsters have increased, as the infallible situation of the two children has become clear, so the arrival of a dead end car will drive them away from the scene by car.
Also, we know from the witness's announcement that the ambulance "was arrived about 20 minutes after the police left".
The heart massage has also been used, but in vain.
"I wouldn't say that the persecutor didn't try to help us.
Young people have been helped.
The fire department has arrived at the scene as soon as possible.
They did everything they could to save them," the D.A. stressed.
Women in tension in Pakistan.
On Monday, the Pakistani police prevented first protests two days ago following General Musarraf's refugee status.
According to the witnesses, about two or two lawyers in the eastern part of the country, in Lahore, have been wounded by the use of gas bombs by police forces in the area of emergency measures.
In return, the police threw stones at them, many of which were injured.
At least they drank legal advice.
Events occurred in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where the watchmen attacked and wounded the lawyers.
They're people.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and protests have been announced for the execution of the arrest of some 500 members of the opposition, human rights defenders and demonstrations on the weekend.
Monday morning, in order to prevent the meeting, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were closed.
There was also a number of demonstrations in Multi and Northwest Peshawar in the central part of the country.
Since Monday, the figures of lawyers are also supported by the powerful Dehida Majlis-e-Amal Alliance, which is a powerful force for religious parties. His leader " encouraged the people to send flowers to those judges who disagree with the agreement and to face those who took their oath before Musarraf."
"The promise of myrraf is no longer valid"
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned by the extraordinary measure announced last night by the Pakistani Supreme Court.
The Court of Justice should, in the coming days, state the lawfulness of the re-election of President Musarraf, 6 October, by indirect vote, on the lawfulness of the re-election of President Musarraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed from office and replaced by another.
"What we bear witness to, is illegal, constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court," said the President to The News newspaper.
President Pervez Musarraf's order, according to which each of the leaders of the United Nations, for his role as President-in-Office of the United Nations, "has failed to take effect" on Monday, announced Minister Tariq Azeem, Minister of Information.
Musarraf had to buy from the uniform until 15 November, the first presidential term of office had expired.
The Information Officer also confirmed the January elections' postponement news.
By the way, the Pakistani Government has been denying the nationwide rumor that President Musarraf would have appointed a place of residence for his general.
More than one third of pregnant women are not planned to get pregnant.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unintended pregnancies.
More than one third (36%) of pregnant women still remain unintended - emerges from the French National Institute of Democracy (Ined) forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which updated contraception.
This result includes unwanted (24%) or inappropriate or unintended pregnancies.
Ined estimates that different methods of contraception, such as tablets or beespiral, still exist in 5-6% of cases.
In the opinion of the institution, the liberalisation of contraception has made the "maternity regulation" more effective. The study notes that in 1970 women aged 20 and 44 have only taken 5% birth control tablets, but this rate is now 60%.
Today, 8 of the 10 pregnant women are planning to become pregnant.
Each of the five sets of miles of accuracy is designed and, if possible, by spring, since this is the most pleasant year for the adoption of the child.
A spectacular service at the space station.
Scott Parasynski astronaut and the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) had to work in space for more than seven hours in order to carry out a major improvement of the solar system essential to the scientific activity of the station.
In many respects, this dangerous journey proved to be minimal: it took a long time to repair, very little time to design, and it had to be done away from the housing modules, with the "barred" tools used by the astronauts.
The problem occurred on Tuesday when the astronauts separated the Harmony module from Discovery. This is a huge cylinder-shaped element, which will soon be the site of European and Japanese scientific laboratory activities (see box).
This is one way to get to the laboratory modules.
However, care must be taken to ensure that their electricity supply is supplied.
The second task of the crew, in turn, was to place one of the modules producing electricity by means of 17.5-pound solar cells, which was already on the ISS, in its perfect place.
Then the crew began to open the module 76 meters wide solar panels.
In this case, one was injured by a string about 1 metre length of one piece of string.
To avoid further opening the board was not continued.
As a matter of fact, the mission of the astronauts was to take a controlled walk from the Discovery space shuttle, and then to fix another malfunctioning solar system. Instead, they had to devote their full time to improving the damaged solar system.
Scott Parazynski was chosen to perform the stunt by hanging on his 30-metre hangover to the station's crane, which was attached to the space shuttle.
He's one of his best "space safes".
High, strong, highly skilled, muscular body and long nature.
The 46-year-old man with medical protection was therefore to "operate" the "damaged" solar module.
After a thorough assessment of the damage caused, he cut off the fault pipe and some "sink" marks the damaged area.
In his work, he also helped another "space walker" who remains close to the safe passage, as well as the other astronauts inside, each captain of the crew, Peggy Whitson.
It used a tool, a mini-hoccup, which was driven by several hundred volt voltages of solar cells, the station's astronauts shot him out and "twilighted" him together.
After the operation was carried out, Scott Parazynski waited until his colleagues fully opened the table and only then he packed all his tools and returned to the station.
At this afternoon, the astronauts had a half-day rest, and today, a week ago, the Discovery spaceman returned to order a return scheduled for Wednesday.
The exchange rate of EADS shares is falling.
The exchange rate of EADS shares fell greatly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the company that produces the metal and defence equipment announced that the delay in the development of A400M is going to result in an additional cost of 1,2 to 1,4 EUR.
The exchange rate of the EADS shares is currently EUR 21,9 after a 4% decrease.
The company was forced to review its estimates for the 2007 performance since the A400M engine development is delayed, which is why the drop of the A000M will obviously be delayed further.
The delay in the transfer of the war transport, which was announced last time, will cost a sum of EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion will be affected by Airbust', announced by the European EADS US parent company.
In the absence of this expenditure, EADS must provide new business figures for its operating performance in 2007, next Thursday, when it reports a quarterly income - the company added, but no figures were reported.
The group also indicated that the six-month delay was taken into account when preparing its new cost assessment.
In 2006, EADS's operating performance decreased by 86%: this was largely due to the delay of another program, A380, which also exerts a high financial burden on the company.
In fact, the company was planning to hand over A400M to the French government in 2009.
Order by the State of ...
Day-to-day elections do not allow great surprises: the majority of Russians will vote for the Prime Minister of Putin, the United Russia.
In this case, the Russians are stable and their need for arbitrary governance is demonstrated after a highly manipulative campaign.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin speaks to the respondents through public service channels, which I have already stated, but its content is still confidential.
Putin is the leader of the Kremlin support party, the single Russia candidate list, which is expected to win a tremendous victory in the elections.
Last night's reception of foreign ambassadors by the Head of State had nothing to do with the recent outbursts of the countries of the USA, which was the subject of the campaign.
"We know what the price is for real democracy, therefore, it is honest, it wants to be clear and free of elections, without any rights" - he added.
However, it does not seem to me that this is the case.
The opposition condemns the campaign, according to which they put pressure on the voters.
The leader of the Communist Party, Gengiji Zjuganov, claims that "in such a dirty election in Russia, Jelcin was not even here."
After last weekend's demonstrations were struck, the former world champion Garri Kaszparovot was sentenced to five days in jail for no protest, and his defence claimed that he could not continue to be seen.
"The Russians are still thinking 'homo soetics."
The predictable selection results raise two, even more obvious questions:
- Who's following Puty at the head of state?
The official date of yesterday's first presidential session, which will take place on 2 March 2008, is to be marked until 23 March 2008.
Since Vladimir Putint was introduced in 2000 and 2004, his mandate cannot be extended any longer.
There are no other clues on the site.
- What role will Putin play from today?
Is he going to be a premier?
Or is it he who, as the leader of the All-Municipality Party or the majority of Parliament, will decide on the government and the President?
Whatever happens, both Parliament and the Presidential elections will be the victory of the outgoing power.
Now it's a tadpole.
"The Russians are still thinking like 'homo agreeetic': they do not seem to be able to control their fate" - said Sociologist Lev Gudkov, Director General of the Sociologist Levada.
Its history, the historian of the University of St. Petersburg, is even further away: in fact, five hundred years later, the country has become a member of Europe, and so there is the development of civil society, and the traditional community has blocked the development of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin has gone back to the paternalist move, which was perfect for the people. More than that, since this new pattern of paternalism has been associated with a certain economic well-being," she believes, Maria Lipman, a member of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "responsibly reject responsibility", which was quickly revealed after the break-up of the Soviet Union.
"Why should we help?"
This phenomenon affects all aspects of society, even the world of business.
In view of the current situation, the administrative elite is concerned: 65 Governors of the United Russia Local Lists, composed of the leaders of the eighty-eight regions, are leaders of the United Russia.
On the other hand, the repression of the country often embodys chaos, as it did in the 1990s.
Public opinion favours stability.
In this context, the Russians do not vote for the extremist parties.
Tamara Cserdenychenko 54-year-old teacher says: "Why should we help you?
The authorities are not so bad, why should we change them?"
It's a memory of a leak.
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Archives, which documents the fate of the 17 and a half of the 15th Historic regime, have become public.
The 47 archives, which cover 27 kilometers of clumps in Bad Arolsen, in the Hessen Province, have so far only been researched for the purpose of "huttarius", and have provided only individual and name-named access to the victims or their descendants in the region.
In May 2006, eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, which provide for the administration of the archive, agreed to open the archive for researchers and historians.
After ratification of the Convention by each State, the archive was visited last day.
Detailed information
The opening of the Bad Arolsen Library allows historians to carry out research into "the transfer of prisoners, the residents of camps and the health status of displaced persons", explains Reto Meistern, director of the archives managed by the United Nations' National Commission for the United Nations.
Recently, several countries, including Germany, have opposed the public disclosure of the public, as they contain both names and such confidential information.
for example, the suspected homosexuality or spiritual weakness of certain deported victims.
The list of concentration camps and the arrest warrants issued by Gestapo were calculated for practical reasons after the war. The aim was to search for deported or forced civilians and possibly provide evidence of their internment, which allowed them to be compensated for.
Bad Aronen is currently dealing with more than 300 permanent processing of tens of thousands of individual needs.
However, some of the community does not consider the opening of the Bad Arolsen archive to be important.
"These documents do not contain anything new," said Benzső Wolfgang, Director of Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the University of Berlin in 2006.
The EU and India would sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
Indo-national bilateral trade is already approaching EUR 60 billion at year-by-year level.
The United States is the first trading partner in India and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India believe that they could sign the Free Trade Convention in 2008 - announced by European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Trade Minister Kamal Natia.
EU Foreign Ministers already asked the European Commission to open negotiations with India, South Korea and the Middle East Asian Union (ASEAN) for the signing of the Free Trade Conventions (FTAs) last April.
The United States is the first trading partner in India and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also an Indian foreign investor, but India is only the most important trading partner of the EU according to the figures of the European Commission.
One Mandelson explained that "a free trade agreement can have an economic boost for both parties" and "India could thus contribute to the presence of a 40-million-dollar florist market".

The answer is: the Bank of England will provide the money market with 10 billion dollars for a five-week maturity.
The Bank of England wants to alleviate the concerns about credit rating, so it announces that it will be investing GBP 10 billion on the money market, which will be made available with a 5,7 percent base and, as a rule, with a five-week maturity this time.
"We would like to make it easier to see that the money market conditions are particularly weak at the end of the year, in addition to the fact that banks may plan to have a higher liquidity position in this period. Therefore, a significant part of the Bank's reserves will be offered in the context of a seven-week open market operation on the international money market from 6 December to 6 December" - is the public sector.
The Bank has announced that 10 billion people (EUR 14 billion) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12 noon local time at 12 noon local time.
This is the first time that the Bank of England will issue cash for five weeks on a non-maritime basis.
The duration of such operations is one.
In the public opinion of the University of England, he added that he would "take further measures" to ensure that banking transactions are based on the key bank interest rate.
The daily average interest rate on Wednesday was 5,829%.
And the three-month interest rate fell to a level of 6.6% on September 18th.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the Bank of England has had a significant interest in the amounts spent on the money market, which is a drawback of the banks' spending on them.
The message (which is only reinforced by the change in the currency exchange rate compared to the euro) would have been much more helpful for the resources offered by the European Central Bank, which could have been better spent and with greater discretion.
UMP and NC refuse to consider the socialist proposal on fuel.
The UMP and the Nouveau group have been suspended from discussing the articles of the Socialist Law proposal on fuel, which is equivalent to the amendment of the text itself.
At the meeting held by the Socialists, the text contained some measures adopted on Tuesday by the National Office of the Socialist Party, including, for example, a 50% increase in employment allowances, a return of taxes on change, the introduction of travel checks and the setting-up of rents.
Since UMP and NC 180:115 voted against the review of the articles, the meeting of the Party and the opposition, which were sometimes forced to speak with a sharp voice, took place last time, only a few hours before Nicolas St.
The head of the socialist delegation, Jean-Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would resubmit all its proposals in the context of the amendment of the draft amending act on financial corrections, which will be on the agenda for next year.
New Festival
There has been a rumor about the new music festival in Philadelphia to be formed by C3 Press, but now the organisation and promotional company has announced that the Vineland Music Festival will be held in a new context, in cooperation with the British producer Melvin Inn, in cooperation with the World Republic.
"It is an honor to be able to work with a man who is the leader of today's American public movement," he said to Billboard.com Charlie Jones from Ctoe.
C3 also organises the Lollapalóza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Chicago.
The New Jersey Vineland Festival will be held in the summer, so there will be a way to plough.
The festival will take place between 8 and 10 August, in a private area of 500 acres from Philadelphia for about 40 minutes.
Director of the World Republic, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Melvin Benn is one of the world's most respectable festivals.
In 1989, he started the British Reading Company, which attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
In 1999 Servicevin Inn extended his visit to Leeds Drive, and then in 2006 the World Republic was brought to life by the Latitude Festival in Suffolki Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has been participating in the production, licensing and management of the Glastonbury Festival as co-licence. By now, up to 1 500 people can be captured by this festival.
C3's co-worker, Charlie Jones, called the Glastonbury Festival the "one of the most inspiring events" at which he participated. He added that his company and the company of Melvin Ben are working together to ensure that the community is united with a European public entity.
"We've already chosen the Philadelphia scene, and we worked hard together with the Fairmount Parks Commission to organise this festival in Philadelphia," Charlie says.
"We fought with the city, and the Commission showed great enthusiasm for our plan.
However, Charlie Jones went on to say that he was dying because of his urban policy manoeuvres."
"We were lucky to be able to talk about this with Melvin Benn, and now we are preparing for a huge festival in another one-stop shop, which will next be for the people of Philadelphia."
A3 Presses brought back to life in 2005 the Lollapalooza Festival at the Grant Park in Chicago, Switzerland, after having already demonstrated in 2002 its unique festival talent with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
In 2007, the gross income of the two events was 9.8 million and 11.3 million dollars.
Both cities were located in urban locations.
"The European concept of Melvin Benn is based on the rural festival, while our festivals are usually in urban green areas," Charlie says.
Our goal is to promote both models in some way, and thus to create a European rural atmosphere and a common urban environment in the world."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The population of Vineland, and even the president himself, is very much in favour of the event," he says.
Although not talking about the details of the agreement, it does mean that "the conditions are sufficient to allow an investment in such an event at a location that may have been home to the festival for a long time".
According to Charlie Jones, the festival's "great" capacity will be approximately 80 000 people in the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennesse.
The joints have already received the invitation to the event, but it is not yet final at the time of publication.
"Vineland will basically be a rock festival, but we plan to offer a variety of music offers, so that everyone can find what's for their own good," says Charlie~.
and two partners, Charlie Walker and Charles At, together with the C3 company, which received the "best independent event" award from Billboard Touring Awardson.

"Handing" is one of the tasks of the montreal delegation.
The mission is "politically difficult" as the Governor of the Republic of Poland, Arnold Schwarzeneg, is opposed to the foreign rotation of his own productions abroad.
Is it really hard to pick up the coin with the "Terminator Government"?
"We must be careful because the industry itself decides which is best for the best location.
If you think that the conditions in Montreal are good, that's where you can go.
Our task is to offer the best possible conditions on which they decide for us", says Schwarzong.
Vertigo for the flies.
However, Denis Turcotte is now now involved in the promotion of Canadian films.
In fact, the police said so for the Timoks.
The aim is to present and promote the most eccentric films at all United States Film Festivals, whether it be the Sundance Film Festival or the Denver, Seattle or San Francisco Film Festival. There is also a need to try to keep in touch with the men.
The writer in L'ôge des tenèbres was welcomed a few weeks ago at the 30 Mill Valley Film Festival.
In January, he will also be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake Hands with the Devil will be presented in Santa Monica and also at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
Quévac also represented four short films and four games in this month at the American Film Institute Fest event.
Will there be an end-of-year round on the stock market? The Committee's opinion will be shared by the "subprime" crisis.
Five weeks before the end of the financial year, investors have already rubbed their hands and are looking forward to the end of the year.
This year, however, it is not clear to the public that this will actually happen.
According to Banif, "statistically in December, the stock market is generally positive in terms of activity.
However, the only contexts with a purely factual background are not adequate, in fact, the current situation is characterised by uncertainty, at least in the long run".
The mere fact that "the market in the stock market is in the presence of liquidity, this gives the opportunity to invest, since any of the alternatives to the guarantee, in particular the fixed yield, which is negatively affected by the escape to quality goods, is long as it is in the short term", does not mean that the stock market is going to fall by the end of the year.
Therefore, the stock gap is more likely to result in a lateral and non-volatility-free movement, "mainly because the impact of the Fed rate reduction is currently unknown, the commodity price is also high and the inflationary tension is threatened".
Javier Barrio, responsible for the production of BPI in Spain, agrees with this, which means that it would also be dangerous to say that there will be a rally.
The expert says, "Sometimes it's not a rose"
Ibex's loss was close to 4 per cent of the minimum value recorded on November 8, when the index was closed at 10.9.4.
However, not all experts are so obnoxious.
Juan Solana, an Analyst of Intermoney, says that Ibex 35 can close the year closer to 16000 points due to the re-allocation of the wallets and, at times, deposits in the ordinary pension fund.
However, the expert adds that some changes are expected this year, as the rally is due to take place on the second week of December, after the Constitutional Festival's long weekend.
It is likely that volatility would influence market trends.
Federico Olucha, an analysis by Inversis Banco, is close to the end-to-end position and "we can see the return of the stock market, which may also increase in the light of the news of the United States, on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
The analyst trusts that this will be the case.
The analysts agree with what is going to be the tolling weapons allocated to Ibex's new maximum quotas.
Solina, from the Intermoney, stresses that "this year the line is on the big scales".
The expert would add the two major banks and some of the founding companies to the top, "because by then the industry would be very grateful".
Federico Olucha states from Inversis Banco that this increase is due to the banking sector and the industry.
It can also be possible for start-ups to have a positive Rally, of course, if there is one.
"The ACS has been trying to recover positions for several months, and we hope that Ferroval and FCC's construction companies will follow this path," says the expert.
cyclical consumption will be the main factor in the rest of the year due to the increase in sales during the period of Christmas marketing.
On the other hand, experts say that the economic company can do well, although there is not a very high level of representation in the Spanish market in this regard.
In six years, five times in six years.
In the last seven years, there has been a sharp fall in the exchange rate twice in the last seven years.
This year's end-of-year rally will be observed in 2003, when the stock markets have gone out due to the explosion of technological bubbles.
This year, when Ibex corrected 28.17 percent, the jump rate of 6.68% was restored in December.
So it is also said that 2007 will be the fifth consecutive year of profit (sometime Ibex has been increasing by 8,46% since January) and whether the end of the year will be over.
The Banco Popular Español opens a 12-year period from 200 Monday to Saturday.
Banco Popular Español has decided to renew most of its accounts.
In total, this concerns 200 accounts in the most economically affected parts of Spain.
These drawers run under the name Popular Max and make a big difference to the bank.
However, it is also the first group for the other European institutions, whose accounts are continuously maintained until 2:30 p.m., even after 10 a.m. to 30 p.m.
The other group, the BIVA, which has repeatedly stated that it is planning to renew its accounts, has not yet taken the necessary steps.
A recent agreement with the trade unions, whose accounts would close 75 percent of them, in exchange for a recent release, although not to the public.
The experience of Banco Popular Español is crucial for the other institutions, which is why they will decide whether to join the promotion of a better business.
This is the objective of the Banco Popular Español project.
In these places, they want to target individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, individuals and local businesses.
The bank wants to operate 200 units of the server all over the world for 18 months with the same register, which is not a new maintenance order, but an existing conversion.
The institution shall update its accounts in the trading area as appropriate for the customers of each street.
In this way, the extension of the maintenance period is accompanied by a new idea of the type of branches, a more modern, much better design.
It is the responsibility of the banks, Angela Rivera, that conversion does not require major investment, but requires more than one entity, which means, for some reasons, more than one or more employees at present.
The branches, in which even the SMEs are offered access to test subjects, will also sell non-financial products.
Long experience
The Banco Popular Español has already implemented the initiative in three Madrids.
However, experience is good.
Adridi Bravo Mimilo, O'Donnell and Gran Vía have lost their choice and Rivero says that the decision was right.
Aanco Popular Espazol currently has a 2.500 account.
60 more work under the name Mundordredit, specializes in immigrants, and also has very favourable posts, even on Sundays and on Sundays.
In the Units of PopularMax, it is not the BBVA model where some units offer a wide range of non-financial products.
"I don't want to create competition for our customers", he points out.
At the same time, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica and will sell mobile phones to external staff.
For the first time, Tecinco doubles its rival, Antena 3 stock exchange value.
"We did it."
By this statement, Paolo Vasile, Commissioner for Telecinco, expressed the satisfaction of closing the market yesterday, when it became clear that the value of Antena 3 was doubled by the insurgent.
One thing, though, is that I'm happy: "It's just that it's not because we've done more than that, it's because we've done less," he said.
He has already given great emphasis to the fact that in the weak market, "we're doing less."
The teleco closed yesterday with a strength of 24,4 %.
This growth represents an annual loss of 15,6 %.
52 percent of the company belongs to Mediaset, 13 percent to Vocento, so the stock market value according to Bloomberg's data is 4.488, million euros.
Rivaalya, Antana 3 lost 1.52 percent last night and has been able to accept 4 percent falls since January, so yesterday, half of them, they were worth it.
The rest of the listed communications companies have a value of 3.5 million for Sogecable; in Prisa (sale of Cinco Días) they have a value of 2.5.1.3 million and in Useo.
Probably, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to similarities between the two companies.
The question is just how much you can do in the same market, under what circumstances, and how this will turn out to be in terms of perception.
Telsinco last week announced that he wanted to be the first one-million-dollar sales channel this year, said Giuseppe Tringali, acting adviser to Telesinco and Publiespaña.
If the information is reported, the 2006 financial year would increase its sales revenue by 3.6 percent this year by 9 per cent, compared to 4 per cent in the 2006 financial year.
The net sales of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first six months of the financial year (as it reached 734.4 million), while net sales of the transmission increased by a percentage point (630.4 million).
It is estimated that one of the factors that has been causing Telecinco's take-off is the high payout: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the company's profits to its shareholders.
In any case, although it would be too difficult to make a decision, this ratio may have changed after the acquisition of 33% of Endemol in conjunction with its parent company, the community company.
"We guarantee the payment of a minimum of 50%, however much more we always pay out.
I hope that this year we will be pleased with our shareholders, since we have already enjoyed 33% of Endemol's acquisitions.
It is estimated that the market is currently under attack.
Lehman Brothers has recently reduced Telecinco's revenue estimates by 7% in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
In addition, it is possible that the estimated increase in revenue in 2008 from 1 to 8.4 per cent, and in 2009 from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent.
According to the same convention, Antana's 3 profit in 2008 is reduced by 4 percent and in 2009 by 4 percent.
It's not like that. It's not like that.
Spain
Ibersecurities: He proposes to buy both securities, mainly because of its high lending capacity and long-term sustainable potential.
Ill
Caja Madrid: Telecinco is seen as better (buying) than Antena 3 (maintenance) because of its "joint attraction" and increased business efficiency.
Detailed on the basis of %2, the hope is empty.
Role: In particular, it proposes to focus on "serious risks" (a single market and a less favourable economic climate).
The Council approved the acquisition of MiFID, which entered into force on 1 November 1.
In parallel with the parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the vote of the Congress which also approved the changes to the Senate, the government launched a social dialogue on the regulation on the basis of the law so that it can take action before the end of the year.
The representatives of the various groups have consistently stressed the efforts made by Members and Senators in negotiations and agreements to establish the most favourable standards for the protection of investors and to regulate the activities of companies in a detailed way, in order to ensure the efficient functioning of the market.
Mifid, which amends the Securities and Markets Act, allows financial markets to be modernised, reinforces investors' confidence, extends the supervisory rights of the National Securities and Markets Committee (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various EU supervisory authorities.
The new directive will allow financial advisory services to be created by specialised companies, but also by natural or legal persons, as well as by securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio undertakings, to form a new financial service entity (ESIS), namely financial corporations (AFIs).
In addition, the law provides for a system for the execution of transactions in funds, thus adding multilateral trading platforms and transactions between settlement systems that compete with the current stock exchanges to a set of rules.
The law obliges investment firms to provide information on the specific aspects, risk, and risk management aspects of their business profile and the control of CNMV should be kept in a register for all operations carried out.
A number of amendments have been introduced by the Commission of the European Union, which is of particular importance that trade in goods is treated as a 'complex' currency, and that is because of the high risk to the consumer. This has been the result of high-risk mortgage lending in the United States (subprime).
On the other hand, the implementation of the directive has also been used to legally outline the activities of those with an economic and business activity. 30 years after the entry into force of the Council Regulation setting out the professional functions of exclusive economic operators in 1977.

The Consumer Price increased by 0.5 points in the meantime and this amounted to 4.1%.
This indicator, which takes Eurostat into account for the calculation of the European Union's inflation rate, shows the evolution of prices in Spain in the last month.
It is appropriate to provide information to Eurostat and to the European Central Bank that is comparable to the data available in the United States, both in terms of time and nature.
The calculation method is the same as the one used for the calculation of the Single Price Index, but the standard formula method can be used to evaluate information that is not yet available in the public domain.
The Statistical Office has highlighted that the preliminary figure is purely for information purposes and may differ from the final data which will be published on 14 December.
"The Consumer Price remains relatively high."
Pecco Solbes, one of the government's Vice-Presidents and Minister for Economic Affairs, said that the increase in the Consumer Price Index to 4.1% in November would only be "temporary", but therefore predicted that the price would be expected to show a "relatively high" value in the coming months.
Parliament's Sobes confirmed that "although the index is not very negative", the inflation rate in Spain has remained more or less the same within the monetary union in recent years.
He also added that the month of November was "less short" than the month of the month of last year, when the Government did not expect such growth.
"We have expected a value of around 4 %", the Minister for Economic Affairs has adopted today's public information.
With Northern Rock, 42 billion euros will be available to Virgin in three years.
The deposits of Northern Rock have fallen back by more than 50% and are currently only worth 12 billion (EUR 16 billion 800 million) since January came into the world and had to take urgent credit from the Hungarian National Bank.
At the same time, it had a minimum deposit of more than 25 billion pounds, the number of which has gradually decreased over the last two and a half months due to customer confidence loss, despite the fact that the Government has promised the bank a 100% guarantee throughout the whole of the year.
Virgin will operate this unit under the name Virgin Money under its own financial, commercial name. Virgin will have to earn about a quarter of the income of British banks for the next three years in order to score the last 18 billion points and achieve the 30 billion-dollar target.
However, the Group of Richard Branson, a highly respected businessman, has a well-known commitment to spend some 50 million pounds (EUR 70 million) on public speaking and marketing to achieve the goal.
Northern Rock this week highlighted the offer of the Virgin consortium as the most favourable in order to avoid bankruptcy. In addition to Virgin, three other companies form the consortium.
Totana has been arrested for a suspected corruption case.
The police arrested the Mayor of Totana (People's Party) in the Province of Murcia this morning, as they suspect that they were involved in the weekly city corruption scandal.
A secretary of the State and the mayor of the municipality have been arrested outside of the State.
In May, Mr José Martínez Óro, a former member of the city community, took over Mr Juan Morales, a member of the People's Party, who, according to the authorities on the SER radio network, was the head of a corruption network.
The country continues to investigate the city's offices and the Council for Development, and it cannot be excluded that further waits can be expected.
Juan Morales' owner was also under investigation as the main suspect in the corruption scandal that broke out this week.
According to SER broadcast, Juan Morales' lawyer was arrested at the time he left Morales with the corruption documentation at the end.
According to the police, the subject of the investigation is the alleged commission that Morales received in exchange for having signed a Urban Development Agreement with a Government of the European Community for the re-evaluation of 200 hectares of city development contracts.
There are currently ten people under arrest.
He accepts the appointment of PsoE in Toledo and the parliamentary presidential post if they make the elections.
The former Minister of Defence, José Bono, accepted to the Prime Minister and to the Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the offer to direct the PSOE's shift in the next parliamentary elections and to perform the parliamentary role when the Socialists hear the elections.
This was announced by PSOE State Secretary, José Blanci, at a press conference, and you, Bono, confirmed the party's federal affairs today after a meeting with Zapatoro.
The Prime Minister explained his election to the former Minister that "we need to count on the best" in politics, and Bono is among "the best."
In addition, he added that the Manchian politician would probably be the candidate of the Socialist Party for the presidency of Parliament if the Socialists won the next elections.
It would take over the place of the President-in-Office of the European Parliament, Marín, who announced on 15 November that he has no intention of taking up the next elections and giving up his political role, rather than acting in a scientific way against climate change.
The former Minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister was constantly trying to bring him back to the political scene two years ago, when he had resigned from active politics two years ago.
He also added that since the electors are aware of who the economic leader will be if the socialists win, the party would also have known who the President of Parliament would have been.
If there is indeed a role to play, it would like Parliament to have "the role of respect and not the character of an insult or a rush" and to look more like a citizen's home.
"At times, it seems that Parliament is the only place in which it can't be spoken, that the Prime Minister's speech has been interrupted 26 times in the Senate."
He understood today's President, Mr. Manuel Marín, for his "excellent work", but did not want to mention himself as President-in-Office, so that the opponents don't think he's "excellent".
Carousel for the benefit of the price.
Since the movement that announces climate change is ruthlessly pursuing both those who are sceptical about their predictions, and those who are in favour of political or social battles must be very strong.
In addition, he must also appoint a political leader such as the Prime Minister of Zapato, who believes that the movement is important as the battle against Islamic terrorism, and he says that "we must enter into a new agreement with our Earth".
However, this comment raises the question of whether the activity or inactivity of the Government has contributed to the fact that the Kyoto Convention is not in its entirety within the Union.
Who are responsible for non-compliance with the Convention, which sector is affected, and why is the Government not trying to avoid this?
In addition, it should also be clear to the Spanish authorities what measures they intend to take to contain the changes made by God.
Which companies will be affected by these measures, the general public, what are the customs to change, what energy savings on an individual and social level and what are the economic consequences of this?
Which means who needs to sacrifice and who needs to pay to save our Earth?
But we have neither received nor will we be given any explanation for these questions.
That's because it's about sacrifice and money.
Measures to combat climate change, measures to combat climate change are always popular.
Costs, pledges and expenses for both companies and the general public are costly.
Even the petrol price increase of PsoE would have been so unreported before the elections that Zapato was quickly withdrawn by Zapato.
That Earth must be saved with nothing, simple propaganda, without any real consequences.
Councils, committees, titles, new posts.
With the agreement with Earth, as the Prime Minister says, who says in the election campaign, does not insist, does not attack, does not in fact advocate election meetings and peace.

He was arrested for a suspected corruption case by Totana's mother and principal.
Police have arrested the city of Totana, the city of Murca, the people's José Martínez Andre, the local police chief, the Secretary of the State of the Town and a guest service officer for reasons related to urban development have been informed about the police force today.
The first one was arrested at home and then transferred to the castle, and there are several other policemen, many of whom are in charge of the management of the Development Council and of the Industrial Banks and Residents.
The three surprises were preceded by the arrest of a number of people in Galicia, Madrid and Lithuania last Monday on a case in which 2 weeks of agricultural land could be transferred to an area open to access to permit the construction of 4,000 apartments for the UK of Nuar in Galicia, following the unlawful payment of compensation to the leaders during their previous mandate.
Two other persons have not yet been arrested, but are under investigation as required by Totana 1st Court of Justice.
The first ten persons who were denied the first time were handed over to the court.
It is clear that Totana's former President Juan Morales, who today is under the scrutiny of the Union of People's Party Parliament, is a representative of the People's Party.
The ex-wife, who is the owner of a property registered in Totana, is also being examined, as is her mother's daughter, who lives in Murcia County.
The director and owner of the Nuara Division, Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigra (Pontedra), the director of the Suelo de Inmonuar Company, together with Pablo José M.G., the lawyer and contractor.
The investigation is carried out by a group of the Police Central Unit, responsible for crimes committed by the government, of which 11 houses were held in addition to the arrests, in particular those associated with the grantees, which are located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Point, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
In Totana, a single person was arrested: the owner of a company that is a well-known poultry products, which could have played a relevant role in the case.
Nuaria Č was supposed to be the largest residential park in Totana, with 5,000 apartments, a golf course and two wellness hotels.
The company has located 2.2 million sqm in Totana, which I have cross-checked. The project would have doubled the current population of 25,000 inhabitants.
A Nuaria Community includes companies such as Autesa e Inomonuar, Vigoban, Coruna, Venezuela streets and Conycase, specialising in direct marketing in the management of parking spaces in Catholic Ferdinand, Preconiza for sale, promotion and assembly of buildings.

Our public reporter found this comment on one of the biggest dailys in Finland: (which must have been the leading point in the PSA report on the level of education in the world), in the Helsinki Word, indicating that it was published on 18 November at the same time as the criticism of Blackburn's book.
"The philosophical teachings after the tragedy of the Jokela high school became a public opinion.
The killer, in his pre-school student's messages, was citing the writings of Platón and Nietzsche.
Councillor Pekka Elo, who was entrusted with the teaching of philosophy, called on the website of the Helsinki Saying website to provide teachers with a critical look at the teachings of Plato, and added that the knowledge of Nietzsche is not necessarily important in the course of the compulsory basic philosophy of central schools."
Detailed on the basis of %2, the hope is empty.

My house doctor gave me an article on a strange research article called "Money is causing brain activity, especially if the other one has less of it".
That employees' feelings on payday depend on how much they've received.
The experiment was conducted at the University of Bonni by tomography of magnetic resonances, and the results were also published in the latest number of Science.
The author of the study and the head of the Neurigognognognognognognognognognog group in Germany, Bernd Weber, said: "We were the strongest when the member answered correctly, and the chairman was the lead."
Researchers found that if they both gave the right answer and received the same amount of money, the brain level was moderate, but if one of them was given twice the amount, the activity was also increased.
I don't know why it took such a great deal of science for such a simple conclivity.
Prosecutor General of the Balkans.
Carla del Ponte has been absconding for the past two years with the brutal persecution of the Balkan war criminals in the Hague and the Office of the Criminal Court of Justice for Crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla leaves with bitter colossal taste, as the responsible for the bleeding in Srebrenica, during which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were processed, namely General Ratko Mladic and the leader of Serbia, Radovan Karajics, are still on leave.
Their name is on the list chosen by the Swiss superintendent Marcel Schüpbach under his title as his dokumentary: Carla's list (2006, in fact, not yet presented).
Is it okay?
Car insurance, which means that the car is liable to a significant cost for different damages and depends on more than one factor, such as age, gender, date of issue of the licence, maintenance status, car safety and the type of use of the car.
The car's only the first.
In fact, choosing proper insurance is often harder than choosing a car.
Of course, we should be aware of what this is about.
Car insurance is an insurance agreement between the company and the insurance company.
This Agreement is a body in the form of an insurance contract, which states that the undertaking undertakes compensation in the case of damage in the case of an accident in respect of the provision of an insurance premium.
Insurance premiums are, in practice, the amount paid for insurance, which is determined by taking account of different factors, such as age, sex, the date of issue of the licence, the status of the family, the type of car to be insured, its use, and so on.
The general amount of the premiums payable by the general government on the basis of the statistics is the sum of the difference between the difference between the costs of the accident and the costs of the accident.
This is why women aged 25 or less pay less because they represent a minor risk because they are the most important.
In fact, on the basis of the findings, the Republics have concluded that married people are also causing an accident like the people of the United States.
The filename of the file is the key.
At the best possible use, the possibility of occurrence is maintained.
In determining the insurance premium, many factors are taken into account by the contracting authorities.
Therefore, the owner needs to look carefully at the choice of the most appropriate form of insurance for his profile.
The following are the most important factors in the choice of how to best protect and price for the provision.
At the time of the conclusion of the insurance contract, persons under 25 years of age must account for a number of disadvantages, such as the lack of residence and the accuracy of the licence.
Although the most important thing is to be sure of any danger, there are also more economic solutions.
A more cautious leader can make a comprehensive insurance policy, which will be against any danger, and the price will also be possible.
In such a type of contract, the insurance pays part of the damage.
"The amount of insurance paid by the insured person depends on the premium; the lower the fee, the less the benefit," says Luis Noguera, the leader of the Internet insurance intermediary, First Europe, in the United States.
Another option is a third party’s extended liability insurance, when the counterparty provides himself against damage to others, but not against damage caused by his own car.
Besides, there will be security against theft, fire and car loss.
Good.
If you are not 25 years old, be careful and preferably avoid accidents, because this has an impact on the bonus and will allow you to reduce future payments in the future.
Discounts in comparison to the basic price of the company are referred to as a bonus.
The amount charged against the basic tariff is referred to as malus.
"The degree of bonus and malus depends on the company and its income.
If the company had a good year, you may allow it to increase the bonus rate" explains Noguera.
If the age of 25 has already been exceeded, it is easier for owners to make adequate insurance because of their experience with the accident risk during the year.
At that time, we advise you to make a full insurance policy on your own.
"However, young people are not yet properly required to apply their stay in one of these situations, even at no time," claims the Supervisory Director of the European Insurance Company, adding that most of the accidents take place in the last year when the managers are already overrun by the beginnings.
If the insurance is already married, but it is not yet available, the best thing to do is to make a full insurance policy, of course, if your legal options allow it to do so.
Insurance companies regard as the least risky customers as having children’s spouses, which is why, in their case, the fee is also reduced.
In this case, the best full insurance is by default (that may reach 300 euros) or, if it has a higher bonus, by the third year of the vehicle, it may extend the insurance cover to damage caused to others.
"They are the most important driver, but they have greater purchasing power and can allow themselves to have a higher share", confirms Luis Noguera.
In the case of pensioners, full insurance may be offered on a personal basis (around EUR 150) or, in the case of a higher bonus, liability insurance may be provided.
Motor insurance is very important, not only because it is a protection for the owner in the event of damage, but also because it is a high cost, it is essential that we choose the appropriate form of personalised insurance.
Celti is trying to score a point in the second place to get into the eighth round.
The Milan and the Celts will build up in San Siro Stadium on a Tuesday to provide the missing point in closing the League of Champions. The Italians can be the first to do so and the Scots can qualify themselves.
The Italians have all ten points, and already in the fifth round, they have provided the transfer with a medal against Portugal, but the Celtee has one point, but one more thing is that the topical Shakhtar, who will hit with the pivotal Benfica, does not advance it.
The two sides of Group D will be held one second before the end of the sixth event, since Milan must be present in Japan at the Club World Championship, where on 13th he will try to solve the award to the 16th final.
This D group is going to be over sooner than the rest, and although the Giuseppe Meazza stadium will be the most likely result, the two teams will strive to win, since the Italians do not want to miss out on their way home, and Celtia can first start in the fourth final.
Even defeat for Gorochan's team is enough to qualify itself if Shakhtar does not win, but it is not certain, even if there is a level playing field, the Ukrainians are moving on, who were in Glasgow the past in Glasgow (2-1), but were worth the next match (2-0).
The Italians will continue to try to hurt the evening of the Scots, who would like to go twice in and out of the League of Transferable Champions in the eight-finals of the League of Transferred Champions, but that's where they got a goal from the Kaka in the 0-0 true extension (1-0) last season.
The "Rosserik" win could be the most fortunate of Shakhtar, because if you hit the Cellit you'll get into the 8th and then you'll be in the UFA.
Since Benfica is now the first place in the world and is not obliged to stay in the European tournament, Benfica can still benefit from a third position with a win that you could play in UEFA.
Two people went to Vancouver to take part in the first round of Spice Girls' trip to Vancouver.
The Spice Girls in Vancouver (Canada) started again, with 2 people standing in front of them for the first time since they were disbanded in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melania Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) before a concert organised in the Vancouver GM Place, a few minutes before the total "remem form" was announced.
There are about 2 other saved tickets to be at the concert, where they also presented a video of the great successes of the 1990s.
The Emi, on which the major hits and two new songs are "Headlines" and "Voodoo", have been placed on the market in Spain, as well as on the rest of the tour.
The five members of the Spice Girls, from the husband of "Posh Spice," the British football player David Beckham, went on a stage in a bracelet.
The athlete was also in the audience of GM Place until the crash, although he had been banned by Victoria a few days ago.
When the performance was played, Victoria Beckham said that the British football star "has not seen our performance dress yet, so I'm nervous about what she's gonna think about the performance."
'Sporty Spice', was due to the fact that the group broke up two years after it got out of the 'cause the members don't understand each other' in 1998. He also seemed to be very good at the press conference, which was held two hours before the concert.
"and I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the feelings of man, the feelings of Pices Girls, are different.
I mean, why not? Now I'm glad that I've decided," said Chisholm about the whole thing that broke up last year because of him.
The singer also added that in the meantime "things have been arranged and we love each other very much".
But a lot of things have changed since Spice Girls last performed in 1998.

This action will take place on 23 December.
Newer fears about the Russian-neighbourly-neighbourly metal exchange.
The gas flood between Russia and Russia has been renewed, which may also affect fuel to be transported to the United States of America.
The European Union (EU) has been exporting most of the Russians through Ukraine and is always paying close attention to the wars of the two nations.
Whoev said that if he were to increase the price paid by the Ukrainians, they would also hit Russia at a higher transit rate.
As a result of the first debate last year between the two countries, supply to the countries of the EU decreased as a result of a previous debate last year.
Ajev and the latter have been the subject of a recent debate between the Ukrainian Government and the State-owned monopoly on the Gazprom's agreement on the price to be paid to Russia in 2008 by the Government of Ukraine and the State.
The Gazprom stated that in the case of exports from neighbouring Turkey, the price agreement with Ukraine for 2008 would require a 50% increase in the case of exports from neighbouring Turkey.
It is estimated that this could mean a 40% increase in the price of a consignment from Gazprom.
"It is important that we argue in accordance with one of the main transit countries of natural gas," said Prime Minister Anatoli Kinah to the Reuters News Office.
"The changes in gas prices should definitely be linked to the debate on the cost of transit through Ukraine (and the United States of America)".
As a result of the most recent major nuisance between E and Kiev, Gazprom stopped the accident leading to Ukraine in January 2006.
This resulted in a dominocentric decrease in exports to the United States, which at the same time resulted in a great deal of price cuts.
One-quarter of the European Union’s supply of electricity is made up of gas.
Russia has the world's largest reserves of natural resources, but most of them are yet to be discovered.
As a result, Gazprom's own gas supply is covered by natural gas from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet states in Central Asia.
The N.N.I. "is required to monitor foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS Committees should improve the monitoring of the criminal records of workers from outside the country - said a supervisory body.
The proposal was presented by the main chapter of Robert Black after a foreign doctor in Scotland has been brought into contact with the judgment against Glasgow Airport.
He also stated that NHS Scotland did not provide sufficient data on the number of overseas workers.
In that report, it has also indicated, through the model of some supervisory authorities, that checks have been carried out.
Following an attack on the Glasgow airport, the chief auditor checked the staff outside the European Economic Area.
The Iraqi physician of the 28-year-old Bilal Abdullahot, Royal Ри Kórház in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after a jeep drove to the main terminal of the building.
Abdullah was one of the three physicians who were interviewed by the Old Bailey Court in connection with charges of car bombing attacks in the United Kingdom.
In the case of staff from overseas countries, the NHS Committees should check the existence of a worker's job and work experience before starting employment, as well as with permits to work in the United States.
Although the Scottish Health Committees use Disclosure Square to verify criminal records, the Agency is not entitled to provide such information from outside the United Kingdom.
In particular, the chief accountant's report has made it possible for the committees to include the Instructions of the Civil Service Tribunal, which enables the employer to carry out controls with different overseas countries.
"Although we have found evidence of some checks in the staff records, they are not being carried out," states the report.
In view of the fact that the Scottish NHS is carrying out its own labour market review process at the same level, he added: "Our report highlights the development areas of the system in order to provide up-to-date information on the staff from the N.N. overseas."
Dr. Peter Terry, according to the President of the Bma Scotland, it is "very unlikely" that through the prevention of employment we can identify potential NHS officials who may perform future terrorist activities.
"In the opinion of the Committee on Employment Prevention in the NHS Scotland, the content of the proposals is not yet transparent", he said.
According to the Scottish authorities, the current number of overseas workers in most of them is 111.
On the other hand, the chief accounting officer pointed out that the figures are likely to be higher, which in part could lead to the commissions being informed of the staff on leave on indefinite leave.
The investigation also showed that control procedures in Ayshire and in the region, in the Olympics, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and the NHS authorities in Lothian are very coherent.
These procedures covered the verification of passports, work permits and certificates of competence.
The Slovak Government is currently reviewing the Directive and Guidelines on the employment of N. overseas workers.
Ms Nicola Surgeon health secretary said: "It was a great pleasure to have carried out this task after the attack at the airport in Glasgow.
The Scottish Government, in cooperation with the Health Committee, has added that it should take into account the recommendations set out in this report and ensure that the updated employment monitoring guide for the total workforce, including those from overseas, reflects the good practice of using it. The updated version will be updated as soon as possible.
Joy Division will be held at the award shop at the Joy Division.
The last singer of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, was biopic, the "Control", and he swept five awards into the British Independent Round Awards, including the best award.
He also received prizes from the main player, Sam Riley, who worked for Curtis before he was formed, as well as director Anton Corbijn and pilot Toby Compell.

The best of the best has become Viggo Mortensen for driving the Mafia Chiefs of the playful conditions in London, led by David Cronenwald.
Ray Winstone was rejected from his hard-core roles for his outstanding contribution to the British science industry at the Huss Prize.
The 50-year-old actor, whose name is inter alia, "Scum", "Séchoppon" and "Sexi Death" movies, is currently involved in the film entitled "Indiana] and "Kingdom of the Circulator".
Winstone is determined to take over "Camelat" and "Harry Potter" from his late star, Harris, in 2002.
"To people like us, people like Richard and Albert Finne are opening doors," said Winstone.
"I really feel lucky that I've met Richardirs many times.
Richard Harris is close to me, he used to have a great actor, and I have a great respect for him."

In Saudi Arabia, 208 people have been arrested for terrorist conspiracy in Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that 208 militants involved in terrorist cells were being arrested, who were planning to execute an immediate attack on an emergency station and several attacks on church persons and security forces.
According to the state police of the world's largest police officer, one of the cells tried to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda's support campaign against the monarchy, which has been active as a United States United States since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
It has been reported that five main cells produced by a resident of a foreign national are intended to launch an attack on an oil force in the eastern province.
After an attack on the world’s largest oil processing equipment in Abqaiq, organised by Al-Qaeda in 2006, Saudi Arabia started to use a force of 35,000 people to protect the facilities.
According to the Minister of Home Affairs's words, 18 of the arresters belong to a group that leads to a "specialized in missile shootings", a person who has crossed the country.
The report also reported that the warriors tried to smuggle eight bullets into the territory of the kingdom.
22 of these prisoners have planned to commit assassinations by church leaders and security forces.
The government called on the church leaders to control the Saudis who join the Arab League, the Al-Qaida warriors, who are fighting against the Allied Forces and the United States-supported ski Muslim government.
The soldiers of Al-Qaida, the Church leaders of Saudi Arabia, consider to be a significant part of those who have been involved by the authorities in supporting the policy of the royal family that governs the government.
The organization's fighters, encouraged by the call of Al-Qaida's leader, Osama bin Laden, for the purpose of the Government of Western Saudi Arabia, aimed at attacking foreign-resident municipalities, government buildings and energy installations.
"The security forces have made a powerful effort over the last five months", he declared a Ministry of Home Affairs spokesperson to state television.
During the arrests in Medda, a 16-person media cell was also caught, aimed at promoting "takfire thinking". Takfir thinking is the ideology of the sunnite Muslim radicals, which supports violence against the unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Among the prisoners were 32 people accused of being charged with financial support from the militants.
Venus's climate can provide an insight into the future of the earth.
Scientists last night concluded that Venus could have provided once-a-time living conditions.
The data of a European circulatory spaceship suggests that this is much more of a world's deep-rooted twin than we thought it would be.
Venus is the nearest encircle of the Earth.
Given the size of the two planets, their orbits are almost the same and their orbits are similar, although Venus is close to the sun.
Scientists today know that many years ago Venus's earth could and could have had very similar living conditions and even habitable conditions.
However, because of the highly high carbon greenhouse effect, the atmospheric erosion caused by sunlight and the world’s lower rotation rate, Venus has taken a different course of development in a far-reaching manner.
Today, the planet has been flooded by water, its surface temperature is hot enough to melt lead, as well as the winds and thunderstorms of hurricanes.
The findings of the European Space Agency's Venus Express space probe, based on a year's study of the planet, show an insight into how similar catastrophic climate changes can take place on earth.
Fred, Professor of the University of Oxford Physics Department, who is one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "Get to the point of identifying why the climate of Venus is so much changing on Earth because the two planets are very similar in structure.
"Our new personal data may have been a part of the history of Venus billions of years ago, and it could have had similar living conditions.
The police are holding a "frozen uranium" in custody.
One kilo of radioactive material - reportedly enriched uranium - was taken last year by Slovak and Hungarian people.
As a police spokesperson, three people have been arrested and the substance has also been examined.
The spokesperson does not confirm that it is a case of heavy uranium, but he said that the substance could have been sold for USD 1 million (£4 000).

As far as Romney is concerned, he does not want a candidate for a presidential election to answer questions from a snowman.
After all, the candidates of the Republic of the Presidential Republic have been able to participate in a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary votes have been recorded and forwarded to candidates.
On the Wednesday night of November 28, none of these questions proved to be such as the snowman who asked about global warming in the debate on the other party's YouTube.
However, the questions and answers this time well reflected the situation of the Republican Party approaching next year's elections.
It is not yet known that CNN producers who co-financed the trial exactly on the basis of the exact selection of YouTube clicks submitted by the candidates.
The longest issue that took place during the first half of the debate was immigration.
This topic is one of the Republicans' kidney pairs.
The CNN has asked for a few uncertain votes that, if you have heard anything that's funny, you should dial a number: the intermediary has had a high level of agreement when the candidates have made a strong statement on the issue of the borders.
The busiest and longest debate took place between Rudy Giulani, who was active at national level, and Romney, who took a major step forward in Iwa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to change the idea that he handled the issue of illegal immigration too easily during his new york estate.
He accused Romney of hiring immigrants to pray for his house by the former Governor of Masschusetts.
The conversation between the two of them became particularly intense when the fires called for the support of "annesty" (which would provide the same status and the possibility of citizenship for legal immigrants).
Some fewer candidates, such as Mr Duncan Hunter California and Mr Tom Tancredo, have been able to get a good deal of depth on this subject.
And even though none of them are likely to be marked, their stay in the race may be a factor in the fact that they began to ring the bell that was ringing for immigration the first and the second time and the more loudly.
At least there is a broad consensus on immigration among the candidates: a common goal is to strengthen borders and to take action against illegal immigrants.
This subject, as well as fear of Chinese toxic games and other worrying factors from the outside, will help Republicans to remember or minimise the mystery between the neighbours and the Christian conservatives.
However, when other issues have been highlighted, the discussion is rather untapped.
Giuliani had to face the reason why he supported the gun check earlier.
Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney had a debate on the question of whether a simple immersion should be regarded as torture.
Another question was whether the candidates believe all the words of the Bible.
In this matter, Giuliani botlaozóva, in the same sense, was concerned that any of his books might be viewed as a verb, the history of Jonah and the balna is simply not true.
Even more has it emerged whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee, who was the first choice in Iowa, who had just won this victory over the expectations of the Christian conservativeism of the Christian, who led to the death penalty being painful, but there is a need for it.
When it was said that Jesus was not enough to receive support, he said that Jesus was better than he was in the election.
The competition is still banished.
Huackbee iowa's dynamic discovery coincides with the successful success of the regular Ron Pauli money transaction and the next debate on Wednesday's occasion.
The emergence of the two candidates is due to the fact that the two sides of the couple have not yet been able to establish common appointments among the most well-known and modern principles of the aspirators.
In 1980 and 2000, there was a candidate who united the party, who, in time and with conviction, was silent about the victory message of the United States and who found a common voice with both sides of the United States.
But now the couple have been formed, and the consequences of this are still invisible.
Multi-stakeholder tools
The newest ravine is passing over ahead of U.S.A.; the exit journey is unchanged.
Compared to the British political scandals, the recent doesn't seem to be too much of a pain in the ass.
No one has sold their trust, no politicians have ever been involved in any unsanctioned scandal involving a few hotel branches, no one has committed any out-of-town scandals.
But the fact that over the past four years, a rich businessman has contributed a sum of $6,50 000 ($1,3 million) to the Great Britain-governanced Workers' Party, and that the couple did not do so, one of the things that was not well done.
Two months ago, when today got away with the election, and when, in his statement - that public opinion polls had no effect on the outcome of the decision - he questioned the intellectual capacity of the British, people were still hoping that Brown would provide a strong and effective governance.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the Deputy Head of the Liberal Democrats, who has made more or less worse remarks, pointed to Mr. Bean, who was once afraid of Brown Stalin.
The Northern Rock, a step forward in the rescue of a narrow circle, has put regulatory weaknesses and judgmental shortcomings in a cross-border cross-border context.
The sick proposals for the amendment of the tax law have encouraged business groups to come together with the government.
The loss in the personal data of 25 million people by tax authorities has revealed an incredibly large problem in the community.
In the face of the Lords, three restless generals protested to lower the army's budget, saying that the defence minister's role is part-time employment.
And now here are David Abrahams' mysterious donations; Peter Watt, Secretary-General for Labour (previously head) has already resigned.
These accidents do not mean that Brown cannot turn back on the way to the exit.
Governments can reach the point after which governance is unrequited.
People don't like politics and don't trust them, but when they come into a new Kingdom power, they usually stop believing in them.
However, as it turns out, the Prime Minister is very likely not to be able to take the lead and perhaps not remain in his position for a long time, the end of the suspended infidelity: the civil service will begin to infiltrate, the ministers will come to meetings, the press will look at bad news; and the government will take action and refuse to object.
In a sense, it is particularly difficult, since unlike other political leaders, he does not matter "fresh blood".
As much as he wants to deny his relationship with Tony Blair, he had a right hand as well.
Concerns about Northern Rock and tax records include, for example, decisions taken during the Brown Minister of Finance.
And although no direct action was taken on the issue of Blair - such as the 'money poverty' issue and the long-term relationship between political parties - the voter may have the right to object.
Whatever your situation is, it's not as awkward as it looks.
The gunshots that have been committed are not as scary as they say they are.
As in the case of H. Bean, no one has died, no one has been caught by it.
In addition, as much as the pain comes from compensation, the creation of the promised trends of Stalin, who lives in Brown, can always be: sound, solid and hard-handed governance.
For example, it is a good idea to be a horde of political covetousness.
The gerbo-definite Abrahams, who compared his gift to charity, said that he did not want to make a good statement to the public.
It is true, however, that it was not up to him to make the decision.
The law prohibiting the designation of major political supporters is clear and clear: the public has the right to know who knocks at the borders of the country's rulers.
Watt, who knows of Abrahams' own action, but was not aware of its true nature, will certainly be sweated during the hearings, just as he knows Melleson, the foundation leader of the Moominist, who is aware of the subtle facts.
However, for the time being, the strands do not lead: there is no indication that they would have known about these coils, even though the large sums were paid after the entry into force of the Council of Brown in June.
So far, he has completed the task of the schedule.
However, while he has been convicted of a crime committed by his party, his firmness has been diluted by the fact that he has touched on any instrument; he has entrusted the investigation of the case - for reasons of security - to a committee of seniors and judges.
In this case, the "learning lesson" does not change.
In the event of an enforcement, the police are competent.
In addition, Brown needs to take care of other things, such as the appointment of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, acting as Head of six-month non-chairmen, or the reform of the effective reform of political parties.
This would require cooperation with the market and separation with the special financial relations associated with the associations - this would be a bad case for Brown.
But do you have some business to do with the couple?
It is estimated that conservatives are currently a real pretext; Brown has two years to back the voters behind it; the only way to defeat victory is to be impeccable integrity and strong competence.
Cardboard box
Is there a risk of a second-market mortgage market crisis in the United States of America?
If blood falls in the water, of course sharks will appear nearby.
Now that the U.S. home market is weak, predators are shifting to the country's credit market.
The analysts of Goldman Sachs believe that if mortgage loans are used to infect other forms of public debt, the market value of the ECA may be up to USD 99 million.
The signs of tension are clearly visible.
The description of both the rate of unrecovery loans increased, and the rate of late payments over 30 days indicates the rate of late payments.
Last month, the HSBC reported a loss of 1.4 billion dollars in the US consumer finance segment, partly due to the financial weakness of consumers.
Half the panic is still long.
Descriptions and late payments are still low.
A Moody's credit rating agency's late payment rate of 3,89% on the third quarter is one whole percentage point lower than the fourth average.
The ratios are partly related to the underlying factors.
The change in the number of insolvencies in the United States of America in 2005 has led to a sudden decrease in the number of insolvencies, but has caused a huge loss in the credit market; a second increase in the number of bankruptcies (and this description ratio) is expected, regardless of whether the total amount of the terms and conditions of the payments is going down or not.
The rate of payment, which represents the rate of monthly credit transfers for consumers, is also stable on the market.
Moreover, trust in credit-backed securities is also quite strong, despite misdemeanor in other areas of structured financing.
Bluetooth Moonene at the TowerGroup Research Company estimates that the emissions volume in 2007 will be 25% higher than last year's.
The signs of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the credit market are clear: consumers are causing debt on credit cards to repay household loans.
Although credit issuers mainly monitor the money flow and not the asset, the fall in house prices does not necessarily lead to a change in the credit quality of creditors.
The situation may be even more favourable for creditors.
If the value of the property is less than the value of the mortgage credit, it is not enough for consumers to encourage the credit conversion; therefore, the repayment of payments on the credit card is a priority priority.
By changing interest or credit limits, credit issuers can change prices faster and more quickly than mortgage creditors.
In theory, this should reduce the risk of re-priced assets being re-priced.
"It is unlikely that one day we will be able to fully revalue loans," says Gary Perlin, Financial Director of Capital One.
If a subprime shock crisis on the credit market is unlikely to occur, the risk of a gradual relapse is much more likely.
If the declining prices of housing and the return of credit bring America into recession, the industry will certainly be facing the future.
It is worth monitoring those predators.
British bankers themselves have found themselves guilty of Enron.
On Wednesday, he confessed to the guilt of the three British bankers who were responsible for investigating their role in fraud under the name of Andrew Faste, the former financial director of Enro.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Multigrew were at first accused of being innocent of a daily fraud, according to which they were likely to cooperate with Fastow in a covert fraud committed in 2000, which could be rich at the expense of their employer.
Their negotiations started in January.
However, at a court hearing before the U.S. Court of Justice, Ewing Werlein Jr., each of them admitted to being guilty of one-stop-shop fraud before the US Court of Justice, Ewing Werlein Jr.
The three former employees of the Royal of Scotland's Greenwich NatWest division have become known in Great Britain under the two-year long discharge procedure.
The examination of the case initiated after the collapse of Enron in 2001 is still pending in the United States.
He warned Fastow in 2002 that he was one of the targets of the government investigation into Enron's bankruptcy.
According to the accusations against them, three brokers crossed the NatWest Three to Houston in 2000 in order to join Fastow and Michael Kopper, who was the right hand of Fastow at the time, in order to celebrate the fraud together with Michael Kopper, who was then right-handing Fastow.
Fastow, who was responsible for the planning of the numerous frauds that led to Enro's bankruptcy, also controlled the Enra subsidiary in which Greenwich NatWes invested.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had no knowledge of any of its existing shares in the subsidiary, but the three ladies knew well that the interest was very high.
A company controlled by Kopper has bought the bank's share of USD 1 million in its subsidiary.
The bank prices paid Kopper 25 million dollars to buy a stake in this business.
According to the prosecution, Fastow misguided Enron that the entrants buy the 20 million-dollar subsidiary from Greenwich NatWest.
However, in fact, $20 million was hit by British bankers, Fastow and others.
The prosecution claims that the bankers were 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others reached $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow announced his dual guilt for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The third one was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving his current year in a state prison in Louisiana.
Kopper spends three years and a month in a prison in Texarka.
The three English men were able to travel to the United States, where they were present during the trial, under a 1 million-dollar bail.
Enron, one of the seventh largest companies in the United States, after the reported bankruptcy in 2001, since the accounting tricks that have been working over the years have been unable to cover up the ordinary accumulated millions or the actual loss-making companies.
With the collapse, jobs went down by thousands, the market value by more than $60 billion, and the value of the pension funds decreased by more than $2 billion.
Kenneth Lay, the founder of Enron and former CEO Jeffrey Skling were convicted of their failure last year.
Skling is currently in prison for more than 24 years.
The conspiracy, fraud and other charges committed to Lay were committed to the death of the man last year.
Poverty in Moscow, Finland.
There's a Gulfstream G550 equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine that's going to make the journey between all of us and Los Angeles without interruption.
However, this amount is only a small amount of money for the rich few times.
"18 passengers fit in," said Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one ordered it because the machine is offered to private families or managers."
Mr. Firer invited visitors to the four-day, exclusive, Millionaires Shop, which was held in the huge exhibition halls nearby the capital city.
In addition to Gulfstream, there are more than 200 other luxury delivery platforms at the exhibition, hoping that the Russians will be interested in all the new rich people, from the Magog-coated yachts to the diamond-covered 50 cents worth of high-ends.
Mr. Firer carefully observed the bright orange Porsche displayed on the stand next to him.
"it's a good car, but it's not worth the trace of our product." he said.
"Private securities have the single market in Russia after the United States."
It seems that the capital of Russia is swimming in money like the Ninth did it at the time of the earthquake.
"We went through a similar process in the 1890s, when some of the United States went to a millionaire in Europe. These are considered by the United States to be material here," said Marshall Goldman, Senior Fellow of the Central of the U.S.N. and Eurasian Studies of the Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arabian and Japanese gamblers of the 1990s in the 1970s, the Russians have now promoted the world's most spectacular spending.
The most exclusive brands claim their share from the covet.
On another site in Moscow, Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnaul, President of the LVMH, organised by the manufacturing industry, gave an opinion on how to sell high value products in similar markets to Russia.
(The general was chosen by The International Heald Tribune, a member of The New York Times.)
According to Forbes' list of the richest people in Russia, there are 53 billion people living in Russia, totalling $282 billion.
In addition, the number of second-generation Russian millionaires reaches 103 thousand, which could total $6 billion, he identified a study conducted in the former Soviet Union by the economists of the Economic and Financial Research Centre, which analysed well-being developments in the former Soviet Union.
(According to the World Bank's data, in 2005, 15.8 percent of the number of people living in Russia was the most under-living population.)
"More than one million people live in Moscow, which is why we are all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of the David Morris jewelry store in London.
Nicole took part in the sale for the first time with the brand's Russian distributor, Soho Jewelry Ltd.
"All women are inseparablely persecuted, and men represent a real treasure spell."
In the rooms on the evening evening evening, two real estate agents, the 21-year-old Evgenia Yumatova and the 26-year-old Svetlana Turovtsova, both themselves and each of them, are attributed to a millionaire.
"I looked at the cars and tried to make a decision between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said young Yumatova, who was very busy in his single-moment, as if he had already gotten used to this upheaval.
The sale was primarily for the new owners, the brand-oriented customers who are willing to move around after several hours on the market to a fat, cifrant set-up, where they can find Cadillac Escaleds, platinum knives, follow-on cream, standard billiards, dubai apartments and Gung plough bears at the same time.
For ordinary people, the ticket costs 30 euros (U.S. dollars).
"The Russians like to know which brands are the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was homeboy with regard to the dead powder producer, the Royal Def stand, compared to a simple, non-removable, non-removable, non-removable Remandt remembrance.
"The Russians, of course, are more interested in the ingenious things."
The sellers here have said that the previous years (which is 10 to 15 years on the basis of the Russian statutes) have already been converted from the out-of-the-out zone to brands made in a flat tool that would not be able to enter a commercial store.
Yet, there are thousands of people, each of them millionaires, millionaires' trustees and tourists, who spend every day in a crowded place.
And some of them bought.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, director of the King Koil bed manufacturer company, sold two mattresses made of silk, cashmere and cotton, each of which is $70 000 each.
Also, on the evening of the first day, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a salesman of A1 Moto on the supply of high-quality cars with a modern alarm, reported that his company had sold the shiny orange Porsche to a new million dollars.
Andrei Karapetian, President of the L.A. Connection, delivered three sets of billboards to Rolls-Royce Phantoms on Sunday afternoon to meet specific needs. The bars are similar to interconnectors and cost 55 thousand dollars each.
The reporters were also shown a wheel for a brand-new owner, which he said was incorporated with Swarovski bottles, to show the appearance of a roller wheel.
One set of four: $22.
"The Russian millionaire, who wants wheels made of leather and made of a circonium stake from his wife's face, is not sure to use these things," said Karapetian.
"Here he will keep the 30-car in his garage."
Despite the fact that many of its customers are rich, in the sense of the word "Russian millionaire", the word "Russian millionaire" is not much of a privilege these days, given the sharp rise in the prices of the property there.
"Whoever made money four or five years ago in Moscow is most likely to be a millionaire today, if not in cash, but at least on paper."
"there's more than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least have caused the Alliance Continent to become the founder of the Estonian wealth management company.
The company has launched four telemails, which have been dying with every dollar banker in the world.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing manager, said that the team printed 500 thousand square bills to the Millionaires' Buyer.
Many visitors stopped playing with money. Many people took photos of themselves using mobile phones like they did in the money crisis, or they just put a few people on the line.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone may feel strange," said Karryev.
A surgical mistake is suspected of being behind a curse in New World.
On the day before the Thanksgiving, Ronald Livingston looked like "Just a little bit more" on the bottom of a minivan and saw an ambulance stop two doors down on Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
A few minutes later, there was a police patrol car.
Another one.
"I saw your car stop as soon as your car stops," said Mr. Livingston, one of the inspectors working in the background on Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone was gone."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was 41 years old, named Olga Arroyo. She was previously employed as a head assistant to the director of the state department in Newak.
The investigation is currently under way to determine whether the death was caused by an intervention by a cosmetic surgeon not identified by the police, who was working on West Scott Avenue without a permit under 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have so far failed to find out what caused Arrya's death, but are threatened that the results of the toxicology tests in a few weeks' time will reflect this mysterious death, which has greatly affected the high-ranking workers in Newark.
Arryo, whose voice has been known to many people in this context, has been working as an assistant assistant to the Director of the State of Garry F. McCarthy since September 2006.
"She was loyal, caring and reliable," she said about McCarthy Arroyo on a phone on Wednesday afternoons.
"..was my housekeeper.
He was my protector."
McCarthy told me that Mrs. Arroyo was recently married to Jimmy Arroyo, who was currently working in the Committee of the Inspectorate of Coal Products, and left two men, a 14-year-old male and a stepdaughter, and a stepdaughter.
Ms. Eileen Walsh, Prosecutor of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, spokesperson said that the investigators were investigating whether Mrs. Arroyo was the victim of an unlicensed operation.
"The probability exists," said Walsh.
"The investigation is ongoing."
It is clear from the authorities that they arrived at the house at 3 o'clock last November.
On 21st and Arroyo were found on the couch.
It's a crime scene. It's a crime scene. It's a crime scene.
There's more than a week gone by, and the police have sold out a lot of money about his home and his father, Flor Margita Gastro.
Walsh didn't talk about whether Castro was heard by the detectives.
Studies have been carried out to investigate whether some of the house was operated as a medical clinic.
On Wednesday, there's no way to get home from Castro's home, where there's a smug rosemunk standing in the middle of the yard, and there's a smile in the back of the house.
In the back of the driveway, there was a back tank in the garage with the words "Etil Vanilin", which is used to replace vanilla in food and perfumes.
On the other hand, there are two sides to the back of the bikes on top of the hoods.
McCarthy recalled when, after 25 years at the New York Police Department, she first arrived in Newark, Mrs. Arroyo has made an inestimable contribution to helping her to manage the new city's global and insatiable political culture.
"He always said, "This and you'll need to look after it!" he remembered.
"He's been here ever since I was here, and he's always been there tonight.
It was a mess."
The expectations of paying off the Fed will lead to a build-up of global markets.
On both sides of the Atlantic, last night the lawyers jumped, after the comforting statements of assurance by the Vice-President of the United States Central Bank have increased the hopes that the Fed will make further efforts to improve investment opportunities by increasing interest rates.
The markets in both London and New York and across Europe have started to move since Donald Kohn, who is the right hand of the Fed President Ben President, has said that leaders must act "flexibly and pragmaticly" to significantly observable concerns on financial markets.
In addition to the fact that Kohn was clear, the aim was to calm down the markets in the midst of the recent credit crisis, saying that the current disturbance "has partly reversed developments in the market in December and October".
This may increase the possibility of further restrictions on households and households' accounts, if the increased deficit persists.
The accounts were considered by the investors to be able to provide a common currency for the United States of America or even for the purpose of stabilising the credit institutions.
The statements also calmly affect Wall Street, which is a lot of bad news about the American economy, for example, it was also a constant record of the number of American apartment sales.
The guarantee of financial concern was also reinforced by the announcement of the Bear Stearns Investment Bank, which represents 650 employees and 4 per cent of its global labour force in the United States in order to balance the overall loss in the context of the US second-rate housing deficits.
20 jobs in total 1,500 employed in the PRC are included in the table.
In New York, the Dows industry average index increased by 331 points, increased by 2.55 percent and closed at 13.28,4 points, while the wider S&P  family index increased by 2.65 percent.
Alondon FTSE 100 index of 165,5 points, 2.7 per cent and closed at 6,306,2 and increased the value of British blue-chip companies by more than 39 per cent.
The German Dax increased by 2.6 percent, while the French CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
The credit market insecurity has been renewed since the European Central Bank’s organization has been largely subject to a significant price of 4.7 per cent of the three-month paper since April 2001 for European banks.
After the inter-bank interest rate, Libor reached the highest value since September, 6,59%, after the steady increase after the last 12 years, all the Bank of England had been pressured to follow the Fed and the ECB, and to release additional value to the London money market.
However, there is a demand for a decision between Owais Shah and Ravi Bopari.
He gave two dilemmas, one of the best than the other.
Who should be the main team in the six-field field in Kandy, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And in the context of the first trial against Sri Lanka, it is not at all important, who will make the decision?
The first question is correct because David Graveney, the president of the team, who performs this particular task on a temporary basis, will help lead Peter Moores and Michael Vaughan to make the decision. On the other hand, because the account of the English Executive Director, Hugh Morris, begins to execute requests for a national or at least one-off decision post.
Of the two players, the lead is the smallest one who doesn't get the sixth beat, but like me, life, and most of all sport is often unfair.
It's never easy to say what brings someone's calling to the top, while it's not even possible to get through even on a lower level.
It is not only the question of whether it is difficult to choose - often on a subjective basis - to choose from.
Is it time for Bopar to make progress?
Is it true about Shah if this happens?
The same question may arise in other areas of life, for example if we were to say John Edwards and "Tubby" Banerjee, two wise, well-functioning young men would be put to the decision-makers, while the two of them only have one.
Who can tell what level a cricket player should take without being thrown into the deep water in a more serious world?
The data greatly influences the decision, but no matter how important the options are.
At the same time, a player on the team must have the captain's look at him at the ricket hood at the moment, and a bat must have a regular chance to become a big player once in a while.
Catching the look of the selections is much more difficult than that.
Over and above Anderson, more people have played more than they have played in the last season, but he still counts as a sure team member in the first test, despite the fact that Stephen Harmison is, according to his own accord, in good condition and is doing well for him.
Anderson had 32 first-class heads down and 33 bucks to fight for his participation in the tour.
Chris has repeatedly only struck 29, but both of them have already had their moments at the lowest level, and they believe that they will continue to do so in the future.
Whether or not to play Bopara in Asgiriya is going to be decided on the basis of opinions.
This decision can either break or break, but it may not have a major impact on the future.
Four years ago, however, Sri Lancan Gareth Batty played on all tests and performed well with five gates as well as 40 useful runs, yet it was Paul Collingwood, who was then emerging, who became an eminent and decisive test thinker, who is probably still undervalued today, given that in Australia, it scored a dozen points against the Australians.
It is likely that in Asgiriya Stanion, looking to the conservative instincts of Graveney, Vurghan and Moore, they will be able to play today in their play, in support of Shah's greater experience of their vokas, Bopar's youthful strength and dynamics.
For all the reasons, I understand.
In fact, it is the bright and successful debut of the 88-bombay test in the quarters of the seven-year-old, 22-year-old Boparian, who also achieved 32-year-olds-olds, who were also in excellent kicks.
However, the fact that Middlesex player Shah was home in May in the Lord's test against West Indies in two quarters only ran ten times, and that the player Aughan, who was willing to re-enter the next game, was faced with the immediate resistance of the players, seems to have reduced the endurance that he had seen in Bombay.
On the other hand, the universal gift of Essex is a life-quite and inextricably vital.
There is nothing to be upset about on the kricket course, but it was well-defined by its off-road behaviour when an exhibiter sank into the team's auto-sponsor, Volkswagen, with a four-wheeler.
However, the first thing he did was take over the (naturally spontaneous) Vodafone's phone and call his remote partner Alistair Cook to ask him, "Did you see this?"
Bopara is a better player with high-speed players, creating a favourable pitch for him in mid-swims, and his shots are confident and clever.
Your right choice is one thing and another is the right moment.
This is the true nature of the selection.
I would give Bopara the chance right now, which doesn't mean that I don't think Shah would give a great deal if - as the Ceylon passports suggest - he was the one playing this weekend.
They transport the refugees home by bus to work and take the fight with Al-Qaeda.
Since then, they have been arriving in Baghdad, Syria, with those Iraqi refugees who have lost their money, either their visas have expired, or, in fact, those who believe that the city has returned to order again.
There are also those who have returned to fight the soldiers who have been driven away from their houses.
The bus station in Mansour was already full of refugees returning from Syria and Jordan before a government convoy of 800 people from Damascus filled with dozens of points has arrived.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubai Sunnita doctor.
"Today I came back because of everything that happened in Baghdad and that the city is now safe.
"They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to Moqada al-Sadr as a ministre who has now shut down his skit's mind.
Most of the people who lived in Amariyah, a 48-year-old lynchist teacher, Qassim al Atwani, came home with two children because he failed to renew his visa and because that rule prevented the Iraqis from doing their job.
His native ski neighbors called for him and urged him to return home, saying that the troops supported by the Americans have managed to squeeze Al-Qaida out of their huts in the metropolitan part of the capital.
First of all, Jordan was one of the leaders of the Sunnite and Shitite tribal leader, who escaped from his home in Sleikh in the North Baghdad after he encouraged his fellow citizens to fight against Al-Qaida.
He came back here to fight.
"Two days ago, my friends called me and told me that they had created an Al-Qaida anti-Miliac militia in Sleikh, and they needed to support me and my sons.
This is why I came back today," said the 2-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many have talked about the fact that peace has been strengthened in the capital since the integration of the US troops and armed civilian forces in cooperation with the United States have lured them home.
However, more people have gone crazy about visa and financial problems when they return from Damascus.
The 51-year-old Salaam al-Samarrai voice of three children gave a widespread view among refugees that Nouri al-Maliki ilitai asked the Syrian government to reject the refugee's visa request to force him to return home.
It is believed that more than two and a half million people have escaped from the state's death traps.
"It was all right until al-Malici had made a visit to Syria and kept pressure on the government that it would not issue more visas for all of us, in order to get them back home," said the Sunnita retired.
"I cannot trust a government that supports those who have sent my house down after I have fled."
One of the reasons for the relief of violence is that the sunnits were banished from the ski areas, while the skis were also resting in the sunnit areas, resulting in a decline in tension in many rural areas.
Many people fear that the sudden appearance of refugees will re-invigorate the scales that may even lead to another fight.
Small rural areas - rural education
The Third Federal Union is a leader in vocational education and training, and its higher education is also an international leader.
In just one field of education, the islanders are experiencing the same deficiency as the rest of the country.
"I told a non-Maxlander today that we are not French" - this is the occasion of the 50th century of the U.S.A. on the posters of self-renal slogg.
France and Luxembourg play an important role in the education system of the country, which, according to the surveys of the German Institute of Economics (IW) of Cologne, is the fifth-sixth-six-six-six-six-six.
In this way, public education institutions - not only for the sake of tradition - are working closely with neighbouring countries.
The island university was founded by the French in 1948.
Students can complete their studies here today with two or even five degree degrees today.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent high.
However, the universities and universities of today's country are also more attractive than usual to people who want to study in island countries - many of them do not have secondary education.
"The countries of Saar are taking advantage of the possibilities of vocational training," explains Axel Plünnecke, an educational expert in the German Economic Institute.
More than one fifth of young people earn further education in vocational schools, which is more than seven per cent of the population in today’s country.
The possibilities of a combination of vocational and higher education and training have also been well developed.
The dual study body is second-placed in Germany in terms of population.
However, despite practical training and under-achievement, the number of seniors has fallen by a third in recent years.
The Ministry of Education in the Insular Region has therefore obliged higher education institutions on a market-based basis, which is the main focus of the EDPS.
"In general schools, we sought many reforms following the first Pisa study," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
The government has introduced cross-border peer tests.
In order for children to start learning early, the last year of protection is free of charge. This is a model that the rest of the federal state has started to change in the meantime.
Whether the students' performance will continue to improve will only be answered by future studies.
Based on the Pisa survey carried out in 2003, the proportion of all the students in the project has fallen from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, overall, the performance of the country has not improved to the same extent as that of the rest of the federal states.
The mustards count as much as they count.
For the most part, islanders in the island will not take into account the knowledge of foreign languages in the Pisa-laundering process - otherwise, they could reap the values in this area anyway,
The language of the neighbouring countries is in some cases a requirement - even if the island countries are not French.
Sharvez is changing the hours.
In the near future, clocks will be different from the rest of the world in Venezuela.
On December 9th, Hugo Chávez will turn back the lengths in the Latin American country by half an hour.
Otherwise, in Chávezba, he has become a subject of poverty in Chávezba.
As stated in Venezuela's official record, a new law will turn the clocks back four and a half hours after the time in greenwichi.
Thus, the South American State will be part of a time zone that is not in use in any other country in the world.
The anti-US Chávez has, among other things, justified the decision that the United States has forced all-hourly time zones into the world.
Besides, on Wednesday (local time) he announced his resignation with neighbouring Colombia for a hostage.
The left nationalist politician stated that, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uri remains President of Colombia, neither the Head of State nor the Colombian Government will be in force.
"I cannot do this because of my own dignity," said Chávez, who advocates a constitutional constitution that the citizens of the country of origin must make an opinion on in a referendum.
This reform would significantly exert its power in the country.
The cause of the debate was Uribe's decision to withdraw from Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Colombian Marxists.
Uribe decided to "arcul spitte" Venezuela, voiced his criticism of Chávez Sunday.
Everyone's talking about Chávez, too.
In the country, a new mobile ringtone has come up: "Por qué no te call" (Why don't you shut your mouth), says the phrase that more than half a million people have already spoken to themselves on the Internet.
The sentence comes from Károly, King of Spain, who, at the last Latin America Summit, has been so upset by the fact that it was true that it was the case.
In 2007, Germans will be threatened by rent-outs in Germany.
According to one, this year there is a real price fall that will threaten German workers in spite of the strong context.
Experts have supported the pessimisation notice with a small amount of mutual support.
According to the calculations of the Hans-Bröckler-Aid, in 2007, the value of the assets in real terms can be less than that of the year in question.
"The reason for this modest contract development, the increase in the overall turnover tax, and the rapid rise in food and energy prices", he announced to the newspaper Gustav Horn, a workman of Macroeconomic and Conjunctural Research.
There may also be another burden on workers on unemployment benefit.
Peer Steinbrück Minister of Finance announced in his announcement to the "Nee Osnabrücker Zeitung" newspaper that the current situation is correct and moderately reduced to 3.3 per cent in the beginning of the new year.
In any case, the German Federal Labour Agency should not be in a difficult situation to find that the currency was used for credit or support, and that the German Social Democrats, the SPD policy, was quoted by the German Social Democrats.
It has been known that the flood of food and mineral oil products has resulted in the worst inflation in 13 years.
On an annual basis, the price has increased by 3 per cent.
Venus is the earthly twin of the Earth.
In spite of Venus's current power, it is similar to Earth, as it has been assumed: In the atmosphere of the European "Venus Express", it has discovered lightnings and currents such as those occurring on Earth in winter.
For the last three decades, scientists have assumed that Venus is lightning discharge.
The European "Venus Express" space probe has shown evidence of a magnetic wave around the atmosphere: The lightnings occurring in Venus cover about 56 kilometers [56 km] from the outside, reports Christoph Russel, a workman from the Los Angeles University of Los Angeles on the "Nature" scientific magazine.
According to the "serious theory", Earth's life has been created by lightning: according to the theory, the floods have triggered reactions in the ocean that have led to the pathogens of life.
Not on Venus: "If there is ever life, it could be in very early times," explains Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
There is hardly any living organism on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is often more dense than the Earth, and the temperatures can reach 500 degrees.
"It may be that Venus may be the twins of the earth, but also his twins," Rusel stated.
The main issue of the Esa mission is that Venus, which is similar in weight and in fact to the earth, is moving completely differently in development.
"Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone in the Venus Research, because since the early '70s, no probe has been on its way to discover this planet.
Research results already presented in the "Rature" article show not only the uniqueness of Venus's solar system.
"There is also evidence that the proximity of the neighbouring planet to Earth is greater than that of the first one," said the Esa.
In addition to the well-known North-Sark Ocean, researchers have also discovered a much faster moving ring in the South-East.
The phenomenon reminds us of the currents of the winter hemisphere of the Earth, says the group of researchers from Giuseppe Piccioni from the U.S. Istito di Astrophysica Spazale e Fisica Cosmica.
The mass of the second inner planet of the solar system is almost as large as the Earth, and its diameter of 12,100 kilometers is almost the size of the Earth.
The sun will also be missed for 2 days at a time when the sun’s sky will be in the middle of the next 2 days.
However, it is much slower around its own tenacity: a day of anVenna Day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although the 460 degrees Celsius-degree surface temperature of Venus with 92 bar pressure is still on Earth, researchers suggest that both worlds are under very different circumstances.
All of them have been gathered up in water, which will remain on Earth as they are, while Venus has passed into the universe.
And while carbon dioxide is bound on Earth in coal tartars, Venus is a major part of this atmosphere.
To protect Köhler, he would like to see Merkel meet with the Dalai Lamá.
Köhler, the President of the German Republic, calls for the conclusion of the dispute between the parties which has triggered the arrest of the Dalai Lama in the Canary Office.
In particular, he criticised the SPD for attacking the chancellor after the September reception.
The President of the Federal Republic of Horst Köhler is concerned about the authority of Germany and has called on the collegiate to conclude the debate on the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this regard, we should not, in fact, turn to the outside world as a religion," he declared to the Handelsblatt newspaper.
Köhlel also expressed his assurance that Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) accepted the Dalai Lama in January.
"European rights are still universally valid even if I respect the speciality between societies", he said Köhler.
He is aware of the fact that Germany must take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, stressed the President of the Republic, emphasised the President of the Republic of the Republic, but he is also aware that Germany is aware of the need to take care of the delicate balance of foreign policy, stressed the President of the Republic of the Republic; he stressed the President of the Republic of the Republic; but, however, he defends Mr Merkol against the accusation that the Chancellor would pursue a new Chinese policy policy in China.
"The State Chancellor did not break up the world with a trade policy."
This is also well known", stated Köhler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier Minister for Foreign Affairs (SPD) has voiced his disapproval over the Dalai Lama's reception and has therefore become the destination of the attacks in the ranks of the Union.
Steinmeier, among other things, challenged the EU's "governance policy" in the field of foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lama at the Chancellor's Office, there was a sharp disturbance in the German-China relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership did not only refer to the invitation of the German finance minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but, according to SPIEGEL, it also inserted the so-called Strategic Inquiry between the Foreign Ministry of the two countries.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao now called on the Chancellor of State of Angela Merkel to acknowledge that it was a mistake to accept the Dalai Lama.
China rejects the formal adoption by European politicians of the Tibetan religious leader, and wen Jiabao supports the position in China.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lama have pointed out that they are trying to break up the rest of the Tibetan territories, including Tibet and other provinces of today.
Säule prevents interferences such as those in the Netherlands.
Road clashes with the police, gunshots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble protects against disturbances similar to those in the Netherlands.
All must be done to ensure that social disillusionment in Germany does not lead to street violence, demands from the Federal Minister for Home Affairs.
Barricades were on fire, traffickers fired a special rifle at the persecutor: After serious disturbance by the French people, the Federal Minister for Home Affairs (DOU) of Wolfgang Schäuble in Germany is afraid of similar developments.
"We must be careful that the social explosive fuel does not accumulate and that it is not subjected to violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the news "Neue Presse" in the Hannover.
Not all young people are truthful about the rapid change of social life.
Federations, provinces and communities are currently working hard to solve problems, said Schäuble.
This does not only concern the integration of immigrants.
"from the integration summit to the Islam conference, the first successes are already emerging."
However, it is too early for the emergency to be dissolved.
Mr. Schäuble pointed out that there are no urban and sociological problems in the German suburbs, such as in France.
In the northern suburbs of the north, the last few young people have fought heavy road fighting with the incarnation.
In Toulouse, cars and public buildings are also on fire.
In view of this, in terms of integration, Khan Kola, the head of the German Turks Communities, has taken a greater step from the federal government.
In France, Kolat warned of the "fears of imitation" of the outbreaks in France.
Although the situation in Germany is not as delicate as the situation in France,
Action is still necessary.
Kolat pointed out that among young people under the age of 25 from immigrant families, the unemployment rate was "higher than average".
More education places must first of all be provided.
Colat stressed: "We must provide a vision for young people."
However, the Head of the Turkish Community has commented that "social security in the family" in Germany is much more present than in the other Member States.
Moreover, young people from many immigrant families do not want to destroy what they have done here.
Kolat warns: "We must nevertheless be vigilant."
Young people "must be given the opportunity as soon as possible to have a job and receive education".
Meanwhile, in the suburbs, Villiers-le-Bel, there was complete peace at night.
The police were ready for deployment, prying the area with a high-speed headlamp.
Competent authorities have reported three arrests and some flaming garbage bins and cars.
It has been reported that a single unit of 1,000 people provides for peace and security.
The police are ready to intervene as long as necessary, and have announced to Minister of Home Affairs Michelle Alliot-Marie since his visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesdays during the day, some 80 people were wounded because of the villiers-le-bel riots.
The following night, the tensions passed over to Toulouse.
The revolutions broke out in a traffic accident during which two young people lost their lives on the day of the accident.
According to the state's attorney's first ruling, the police are not responsible for the death of the state's attorney.
In the realm of Angela, a cloud of cloud.
The chancellor's action has since taken a long time to prove that the coalition is at the end - and it is not expected that it will be any longer.
In fact, does the State chancellor live in another country?
In the general discussion of the Bundes Member, it is necessary to determine, in relation to its content and content, whether it is not here - it is not in the country in which it is up to him to govern.
He refused the charge with a modest sentence by Angela Merkel, who would be too involved in foreign policy.
This is pro-vintial, she replied, and in this way all she said was that she didn't want to understand what her critics were talking about.
At the Conjoint Assembly, it made it clear to everyone how much they can find in the eye as they are in the eye.
In the meantime, neither specific nor empathy has been sensitive to the country's problems.
Instead of coming out, Angela Cloud: a politician who has fled from a past who is fleeing to foreign policy and who has only the uncertainty of his own.
Example of climate protection: Heiligendam is definitely praising itself for decisions, but he is listening to how to achieve climate goals in the country.
On the contrary, as far as your esteem is concerned, some of the modestness of this kind has not been permitted in the past two years by the President of the CDU.
Now it's in that phrase that Prosperity has a positive effect on the human being.
This is a pragmatic religion that causes some good news that can solve the problems instead of word flowers.
However, domestic policy problems in the realm of Angela are only marginal issues.
Poverty and the problems of the weak?
That only serves a few half-words.
In this regard, it is a lot to say about how often you make a grammatical report when it comes to the addition to your home.
Once, Merkel has to start to get a half-width of a whole-handed-footed line together.
When it comes to specifics, it's in a strange area.
Heaviness Division
During the debate of the Republican presidential elections on Youtube, the two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romene have been hit hard - they must now be held from an outside candidate.
The tension of the candidates has already come to light on the first theme.
What Romney says to his opponent, Rudy Giuliani, is that "illegal immigrants have made New York".
For his own part, he says: "I would say that his own house served without permission for immigrants," Giuliani recalls, and he gives up Massachusetts' one-time governor's view that he does not employ immigrants as a private citizen with documents.
The candidates are on the move: Since the Republican Republican country is still still not a well-supported favorite, the eight Governors of the Republic will use the debate at CNN in particular to undermine its opposition.
The 30 seconds of self-returning 30 seconds sent by Internet users via Youtube is more or less approximate.
"This is the type of isolacionism that we have given to Hitler," says John McCain, under his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one who demands immediate withdrawal from him.
Romney's head is also thoroughly washed by a venetian venetian who is reluctant to accept as an emergency the so-called "Waterboarding", the method of questioning, where water-suffocation is simulated.
The fact that the important topics of the campaign, in the meantime, only move away from the debates on Iraq and on torture, is shown by the reaction of St. Petersburg, Florida, to the scene of St. Petersburg.
There is a loud tap in the room when conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
In the meantime, they are increasingly more truthful about the sub-tenders of the two indicators.
"I was wrong at the time", she was remorseful of Romene and pleaded to the supporters and to the public for the fact that she had lost her vote in favour of the break-up in May.
However, I am curious when you ask for your opinion on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf is the first government to go like this.
One day after returning from the front of the army, he was called President Musharraf, who spoke in Pakistan.
By doing so, two years of military control will end in Pakistan.
The Pakistani President, Pervez Musharraf, has been given a further five-year term of office.
Pakistani television, living from the capital, Presidential Palace of Islam, broadcasts the ceremony.
Musharraf swore to the Constitution and to act in behalf of his people.
On Wednesday, he handed over his military leadership office to his confidant Assfail Kiyani, and thus allowed the United States of America first of all to international pressure.
The former four times, after the fall of power in a US coup d'état, he now governs for the first time as a civilian head of state, after the fall of the former four times without bloodshed.
Musharraf, by returning as commander of the armed forces, made a fundamental point of the West and of the opposition.
It is an important priority to put an end to the emergency situation, which Musharraf announced on 3 November.
Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayum Musharraf will soon cease to be in an extraordinary state of emergency, which will fulfil another point of the United States.
The Supreme Court of the country, in which Musharraf, at the beginning of the month following the extreme state of play, has instituted lawyers sympathizing with him, has recently rejected any objection to the re-establishment of the state's last 6th indictment.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed and four more were injured by an assassination of a military convoy in the northern tribal region, North Pakistan.
According to the word messenger, the bomb exploded close to the Afghanistan border.
The father of Krautrock returns.
The German Network of Seventy-Sevenths: The three band members of Harmonia re-orientate their instruments until the end of a Berlin concert.
With the remodeling of their time, at the time of "Live 1974", a played game appears in the time of "Live 1974".
They were already much more common abroad at the time.
The body sensation is the body of the three settlers, who are at the table.
First and foremost, his own instrument, his own self and, above all, his own interfaces.
Dieter Moebius is the 63-year-old man in a snow shirt in the middle of the throne.
That is about the age of 57 years of young Michael Roth provides a escort in the knowledge of a card and guitar.
For the general public, the 73-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius leans and speaks to the console.
Each of them produces something, once in a while it's a rhythm.
And all of this is all about being made up of traditional music.
However, it does not seem to bother the employees themselves in particular.
It was a great deal of concern to the critics of the Krautrock band that Harmonia was once again speaking together.
We can say here: A proper follow-up can be used to determine that the name has fallen through the collective pop-up, but in no case has it left any lasting signs that we are going to miss this thing for 32 years.
But why can't the Germans celebrate 70 years of living legends?
Especially that what we call a "kruutrock", in England and in the United States, has always been more valued than in its own country.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize for Life in 2003, the German pops were sitting in the room with an understanding of their face.
Even when the Red Hot Chili Peppers presented their thanks to La Dusseldorf and Neu!, the thought became complete.
The concerts were followed by Michael Rother sitting as an old pal with Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage.
Home refusal and acceptance are two sides of the same coin.
The memory is only overburdened by Harmonia because the trio has only been alive for two years, and during this time it has had a far less effect than others have done since.
Moebius and Roedelius have already studied with Conrad Schnitzler under the name of the long-lasting Cluster.
In fact, they are playing under the Theatre of Naabuyu, Berlin, anyway.
Then, in Düssdorf, economic growth is the reason for a church-to-house Internet company.
Rother has been helping the Käftwerk group for a short time, and, at the same time, this is actually the most radical German band, the Neu! guitarist, who has become famous for himself.
In 19 C.E., Roth followed the musicians of the Cluster into their exile in Weserbergland Forst.
There, in Alter Weseshof, they lived in a 16th-century Rom, a fugitive from the city.
Less ideologically ideology than in the I. commune, where Roedelius was still a baby child.
They're more like an ancient art scene.
It's said that the flag of the Harmonia Odenstein spear came from the garbage, and that's how they found their names.
Some of these factors are the Harmonia.
The first album is entitled "Musik von Harmonia" and the next is called "De Luxe".
Despite the loose and modest music, the joint needed material support.
The only thing he didn't guarantee was his own find.
The CD published under the heading "Live 1974" was recorded at a concert in Griesem, in front of an audience of 50 people, so he remembers it.
The effort of Harmonia and, occasionally, it was Roth's idea back then.
For Roedelius and Moebius, this is a misdemeanor.
In the band, he announced the elimination of the gang in Hungary.
Roth ended up in the sootterika and held himself in albums like "Flammende Herzen".
The Cluser is a resuscitation in the '80s, which has been more successful than the Harmonia has ever been.
Giesemi's album is a rich one thanks to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His eardrum, which listens to the name Grönland, was designed to take care of the Krautrock as a special German additive in living music.
In this context, it has already created Neu! as the work of Roedelius.
The Harmonia resurrection will take place in the House of Cultures in Briton.
From public money, within the Woldtrucs Festival.
Julian Cope, author of the üttspunk and Krautrock Sampler, is also present.
This is the case with Loveparade's author, Dr. Motte.
This outlines the impact of krautrock on the next pop music period.
In this regard, Harmonia fills the network with a reserved empty space.
Briano's definition of "the only true music, the future."
There are pictures of the producer with Harmonia in the room of a farm house.
The screening of further black and white photos of the mosaic equipment is a feature of the legend construction.
In particular, the three veterans re-introduce the improvisation of the three veterans.
This simply means that microphones are recorded for the organ and for the disposal of waste materials, with the intention of instrumentation using its own espionage sound-effecting devices that have not yet been heard by means of the instruments that produce its own espionage sound-effects.
Today, the music looks like an electric sound.
Three deep-seated pendants, three in depth.
Even the housework doesn't make any difference.
Under the guidance of Pygenstern, they cough and kiss, and sing "Aaaaaaah!" with a sense of "Aaaaaah!" in a part of it.
In all cases, Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It was all about the kid.
The roots are less used in blues than in the Departments of Music (Can), in formal knowledge (Kraftwerk), or in the run for artistic and social conventions (Custer).
If you're yelling "'68" here, you're not doing the wrong thing, and Harmonia doesn't let you get out of your way right now.
They've been thinking very carefully on the stage, and they're obviously thinking about it.
Where is the music playing, and where does it end?
This nervously can overpower a man, or it can be recommended by the moments of the exceptional misfortune.
Richard never quite enough cynical enough.
"Acquisition" and "Mörderische Frieden" repeatedly deal with the war in the Balkans.
However, neither of them is convincing.
The basic idea is either too much for action and shooting, or it's too emotional.
In fact, none of this actually helps us in the "Secretation".
First of all, the good news is that although the two militant sinners, Karajics and Mladics are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, yet there, in the dark of the war in Bosnia, they found again what Richard Gere was in the back of.
Recently, we have lost sight of the man of the '80s, since many well-known roles and many press conferences in the context of Buddhism have still lost our minds in the emotional films of women.
And look, suddenly, Richard Ye is the last argument in addition to perhaps seeing the movie "Warning" c. film.
It is a wonder that it gives a smiling lesson: In fact, what Simon Hunt was designed by him was what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry were not such a favour: A man who left behind the past years ago, but who, as a matter of fact, preserved a certain part of the attraction of a time.
However, the German production "Mörderishcher Frieden", which was launched this week, is still in the endless line of the events of the war in the Balkans, despite this fact.
The movie "Mörderischer Frieden" does not have much to say: The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Rememelt), who save a Serbian woman from snipers in Kosovo, and one of them even loves me.
It is to be welcomed that for the time being, Serbs are not represented as the sole cause of all evils, as well as the low level of human beings, as well as the rapid loss of the weaponry and the event-prone situation in which the human beings are low.
"Cobra 11" is carrying a cell phone - a freeway service with war.
On the other hand, in the case of "Warning", it is advisable to examine why it is not really a really good idea of the war in the Balkans.
The three military scientists in the United States, who are spinning up to explore the Serbian war criminal who listened to the name "Rokka", with another director, another judge (both in the Hepard Personal Union) might have become a new "Apocalypse Now" in another time.
Each story has a surprising similarity: In both cases, small parts of the forest are being cut off for it to do what the animal can - and in this case, the journey of madness is going around.
One of the reasons why the "Driving" failed is that Simon Hunt does not allow his heart listener to be frantic cynical as he was originally shown to him.
No, and besides, he has also spent a romantic relationship with a woman who was later murdered by a Muslim bilge.
The "Training" will disappear forever when the reporters reach what NATO, the CIA and the world were unable to do in the last five minutes by means of a speedy recording of the last five minutes: they will capture the identity of the person responsible for transit and hand him over to the people of Mohamden for a fair refoulement.
It's so bad that man would rather go to the Hague Common Law for a crime against the logic of the cinema.
Each one of you is deeply human.
He intends to impose on a mercenary that Karajics and Mladichis are still in custody and that he is accusing the Americans and the French (it is claimed that they are still quite uniform) that there is not enough intensive persecution due to scientific political negotiations.
But good and evil always seem to each other like a man has a famous Breecht vers in his mind.
This poet writes about the famask of the Asian demon in his court: "I am very upset by the indiscriminate grip that tells me what a pain in the ass is to be bad."
Films such as "Warning" have the same oversized, word-shaped masks, which, however, show how exhausting it is to be.
This problem is not limited to the base of films on the Balkan War.
Recently, it has been reported that all Hollywood movie about Ethnics was a nasty fall.
We can add: There is not yet any good part of New Africa.
Almost always valid: If a star is a star in the world's collages or in the world's ambiguities, then something like "on the paths of freedom" with Patricia Arquette, "without a term" with Angelina Jolie or "bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo Di Carro.
It is possible that these conflicts may still be too close.
It took decades for Hollywood to be able to film a good relationship about the holocaust with the movie "Schiniler List".
Some films are still in play - for example, the Vietnamese war, today it is a sixth-rate work, such as "The Beast Hunter", "The Boyfly Now" or "The Ball Metal Jackett", have not been celebrated by the two of you, in your own unanimous form, as artificial.
It is unlikely that these days, when each of the masses is in real time, each through each of them comes to our home, we know far too much about world change.
And that would deprive the reviewers of ignoring reality, which would help to tell good stories.
'Cause "I don't want to be," or "Advocacy," after all, because Lubitsch and Chapin didn't know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
It must not be good if it is to do good.
Perhaps we should put the novelist Lawrence Norfolk in a sarcasticly distant artistic vision.
When he was told about the historical novel of Lemprière and the parallels between the Balkan war, he said, "It's just that certain things never change.
Cities will always be extremely dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be a war in Yugoslavia."
Von Beusto is highly criticised for the resignation of the Olympics.
The demarcation of the mayor from the tender for the establishment of the Summer Olympic Games in Hamburg has created acute criticisms in political and economic life.
Many people will continue to fight for the display of water.
Von Beus, however, is a strong warning to reality during the promise-making process.
On Wednesday, the Director-General of the Chamber of Commerce of Hamburg, Hans-Jörös Schmidt-Trenz, called for the "economic environment" to be withdrawn.
No other project has recently unleashed such huge motivational forces in the city as the Olympic idea.
"For this purpose, we cannot maintain a level playing field in sport policy."
Schmidt-Trenz said that the Senate should not bury the project, but develop a long-term initiative "which results from time coordinates".
Bel von Beusthai has maintained his previous reservations that his ambitions for the Olympic Games in Hamburg are not real until at least 2028.
"He does not decide on the Olympics, but on the German Olympics Association", he said to Mr Beus to the WÉ ONLINE.
After having received a notification from the National Parliament of the proposal for the Summer Olympics in 2018 for a decision to be taken at the National Olympic Games in Munich, which was due to take place in the first place in the first place.
"The advantage of this means that we have so far thought out that we will not have a real chance over the period of 2028."
We don't give up on the dream, says Beust.
He expressed his regret at Beust's statements.
This gives the impression that Hamburg will not be willing to tender the Olympic Games for the next 25 years.
"It's too early for us to get away with the fact that we're already burying our plans," said Günter Plogus, President of HIB on Wednesday.
In addition, the withdrawal from the application is contrary to the statement by the president of the Senate at the public meeting of the General German College Association.
In fact, there was a tender for Von Beust Hitler for the 2015 Universal Prize in which Von Beust has been awarded, which does not mean that it is not an alternative to the Olympic Games in?"
The College Association has only started the competition for the city of Budapest last week.
The citizens' group of the SPD has encouraged the Senate to leave valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Kleiner Grasbrook has been requested by the Senate for many years because he was voting in favour of the Olympics and abstaining from housing", said two SDD representatives, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD continued to break its armour in favour of the integrated plan for the use of the Olympics and the later arms on Kleiner Grasbrook, the CDU focused on the "event-factor".
The tender for the Summer 2012 Olympic Shops was very enthusiastic at the time.
Üli Lipcsé has fallen.
These aren't even where they are.
The man who connects concepts between the world and the wall is Ikea, not Andy wherever he thinks.
Oh, yeah?
Currently manufactured adadas cast a dark shadow on the works of wherever.
Here are the forty-four "Seroholm Types" Brillo Box for a large part of the credit card.
After a few months of Swedish paper "Exressen", Andy Warhol, in 1968, introduced the performance of the Brillo's Offices, and now the internal investigation of Moderna Museet in Stt home, to an extenuating conclusion: In 1995, the Moderna Museet was awarded to Moderna Museet by Pontus Hultén, one-time President-General, in 1995, and in fact, the "Brillo Act" was largely supported by the "Brillo Act" and the "Brillo Pack", which is a major part of the "Brillo".
This is a long and complicated chain of artistic and curatorial mutations.
In 1964, in New York, he created his first "Brily Papers" - the cardboard box of "Brily" soap dust, based on a white, blue-and-white design.
In his work, hundreds of Brillo boxes, made of paper, were issued at a Moderna Museet in 1968, with the consent of Warhol: they were not delivered from War where (cost-saving) but directly from the Brillo Carton factory.
It wasn't about creations, it was about their templates, simple exhibits.
In 19 days, worldwide, he gave permission to manufacture some of the Brillo-Nadas in other parts of the world, which, however, are not exhibited in the Modern Museet.
The witnesses are now talking about a few fifteen crates that were then certified Original-Andy-Warhol-Brilo-likely entered the history and history of "S Stockholm".
Some of them have been priced for more than 100,000 dollars.
The problem, however, is that Pontus Hultén, the legendary director-general of the department, once again wrongly stated that in 1968, they produced and produced about a hundred coves and exhibits in the rest of the world, which were left behind by Warhol.
In fact, Hulten 105's case was produced in Malmö only in 1990 for a sacred-peter-winter exhibition in Malmö.
At this point, however, where he was already three years dead.
Lars Byström, the main art recollector of the Moderna Museet at the museum, has also studied three Swedish private box in addition to Brillo General, two of which were made in 1968 in Stockholm: The pressed billboards were first printed and stamped, and then the white oil was then taken up by brushing.
On the other hand, the structure of the revisions from 1990 shows that the paint was taken directly to the plate without a basis - and it is not oil, it is acrylic.
"These boxes are not certified by the artist, so they should be erased from the official register of the books of Andy Waro Brillo," says Lars Nittve, Director of Moderna Museet, "Unless the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' of New York does not decide otherwise, the Modern Museet in its history will be used as an alternative/exhibitional tool."
The Authentication Board announced, of course, in June, that it was in line with the soap-suppressed crates for serious accusations".
Since then, however, they have been banished into unsolicited silence.
Manila'sposter Wars are giving up.
In the Philippines, the troops who barfed themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the intervention of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, President of the Philippines, have given up the campaign.
He cannot take any responsibility for the bloodshed, he has declared to reporters at the hotel their leader, Antonio Trillanes, who has accused the President of corruption and election fraud.

Governmental units have abandoned the surroundings of the most prominent hotel.
The President has appointed the Security Department to an extraordinary meeting.
Norberto Gonzales Security Adviser condemned the military procedure.
"They have the power of men," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, formerly commander of the Out Ranges Elephants, claimed that the other units of the United States wanted to join the process in a short time.
Government critics have raised a strong protest against the president on Friday.
The government is being framed by more than six months of corruption charges.
The financial district of Manila was already the main place in 2003 in its attempt to roam against Arryo, organized by 200 members of the army.
The uprising ran out in the past almost 24 hours when the army was forced to join.
Since then, at least seven coup attempts have been carried out in the Philippines against the non-elected governments in the Philippines since 19 years.
