A 9-year-old son found a 9-year-old son who had escaped from the 19-year-old.
The police have had a search warrant for a 9-year-old boy's escape on Tuesday night.
The disappearance report for the son who left the West of Tampere with his friend has spread through the media.
According to the police, the boy has been contacted, and he has no danger of life or health.
The son's father told Ila-Sanom half-knows that the boy was found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start some research.

Rozaldo's again in the heat - ripped the paint off the Messin.
Castiano Ronaldo struck five goals in the Spanish league during the weekend and continued to work in the Masters' league.
The battle between Lionel Messin and Cristiano Ronaldo from the league of the Champions League, turned to the final favour for at least a moment.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo, alone, reached the top of all the goals, when he shot a visitor to the Shahtar Donetsk network, two hits from the policy options and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his goal level to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess has 77 hits.
Real won the game 4-0.
Since the beginning, the announcement has been a failure in the British football league in Serie A, but in the D section of the League of Masters, it started with a strong 2-visual victory in the city.
The most powerful one was the 10 minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The attack on the ground was dulled by the absence of the kneecapper Sergei Aguro.
Aguro, who was injured in the election game during the week, only arrived at the field on one of the 10ths of the week.
In addition, the second company in the United States experienced a hard fight against PSV Endhoven in the Netherlands in support of the 1-2 loss.
Man's 20-year-old I.A.R. Luke Shaw's only needs a quarter of a hour.
The dangerously-looking release of PSI Hector Moreno hit the ManU package that was attacked towards the paint so badly that Shaw was likely to be cut off by the tibia.
Jeff lay on the lawn of the Eindhoven home stadium for a decade before the medical staff took him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in the 41st minute to the 1-0 lead, but ManU's joy only lasted a few minutes.
Two times a week with more time.
In the second half of the period, the PSU's profit was made by Luciano Narsingh.
At the turn of the Masters of the Landing season, the A-block began Paris Saint-Germain.
The subject was the changed Argentinian Angel Di Maria to the United States shirt PSG.
Di Maria entered right through the right and raised the ball back past Malmo's goaltender, Jul Wilandin.

PG's been bets on the number of seats.
The function is not correct, but Malmö, a member of the too small-scale league, is not the best benchmark for comparison.
The main beneficiary of PG, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, met for the first time with his career's departure from Malmiö F.
Ibrahimovic started his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes after his team lost in the B-block match in Moscow, Germany, to Wolfsügi 0-1.
The opposition requires immediate separation - the President gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe spoke in the same speech he had given a month ago.
The President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has once again spoken in the country in the same speech he gave last month.
Mugabe did not understand the same speech during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, a 91-year-old, was in full life.
The main opposition MDC insisted that Mugabe resigned because this is too old for the world.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that there was only Mugabe's presence and that he had done nothing wrong.
Mugaben spoke earlier and now about the impact of the country's economy on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria have a few additional summits on the refugee crisis.
Germany and Austria have been looking for the next six additional summits of EU leaders for the sake of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council to meet, will assess the opinion.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how more effective registration could be achieved in Europe.
According to Merkel, the negotiations on asylum quotas are part of the Ministerial Conference.
He was shot on his cell phone by a gunman who had shot himself.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked for a voice in an emergency call to shake a little at home and told him that he had shot at him.
In particular, he mentioned that their own home was present and alive and probably afraid. The professor told us that the information about the dead family would be on the phone.
Home-in-house cops found Amy Prentiss's body and a hand-written message on the white paper: "I'm fine and I hope I can reverse what I did. I lost Amy, and she's the only one who ever loved me", according to the record in Lamb's book.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at the Delta State University in Mississippi Cleveland, had already traveled 500 kilometers away to the summit.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police of Delta State University, said that the University authorities were informed of the shooting at 10.18 p.m.
According to him, he was having a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
There's still one more case.
The next day, the students and the civil servants had a vision behind the locked doors, and they were still trying to figure out the Lamb's motive.
The researchers studied the details in both places, and the teachers known to Lamb told us about the man.
Students always said they were looking forward to reading lessons.
According to the police in Gautier, the police in the City of Prentis's death, the professor had no history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned Lamb's book, which had given credit to the "wish people" he was allowed to spend an academic life with.
Both work in a social science and history institution with 17 staff members. Many of them took part in both courses.
However, references to problems have been raised.
The student, Mr. Brandon Beavers, who praised Mrs. Lamb, said that the professor seems to be agitated and nervous, "as if he had something else."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him about the stress he suffered at the end of the academic year 2014-2015.
In the past, he had applied to Delta State University for maternity leave for some kind of health problem.
This year he only learned two online courses.
Recent changes in university remuneration meant that the argument for which Lamb had worked hard could not easily back up the post of assistant professor.
University principal William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was concerned about something.
You can't answer these questions anymore.
Upon leaving the campaign, the police found out what route to Lamb was from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before police officer Lambin, he had taken his own life with a 38-calibre pistol in the backyard back in Mississippi 54ville, about a half mile from his home,” said Mthel Johnson, the Death Inspector of Washington County.
Lambi's car was still in the driveway.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to the house, but Johnson told me that he believed that the home was home for the residents.
He spent his youth in the area.
Further work started as a science and education teacher at a university of 3.500. There were 12,000 inhabitants in the night in 2009 .
In the spring, he received a doctorate in education.
One of the longest friends in Lamb pictured this as intelligent, charismatic and smooth.
Carla Hairston told me that he had met with a man in common when he was 15 and Lamb 20 years old.
He was still drunk, and Lamb was an interesting new guy who was trying to teach Hairston a guitar game.
"Lam was then the true God-god.
Everyone was at the hospital," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburbs of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had obviously been seeing each other for some time.
On the emergency phone, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but that none of the documents is yet dedicated.
Couple had a car called Lightning, and they lived in a dumpster in the river basin in the small town of Gauter.
She said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's former husband, Shawn O'Steen, told me that he had resigned from Prentiss 15 years ago.
"He was very upset," O'Steen said of himself.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen had never known Lamb but heard from Abigail that she liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss are used when Lamb and Abigail appeared both in summer events three years ago.
Later, they used to hang out together sometimes.
According to O'Steen, he's got his daughter to walk and load his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many businesses through the shop.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment instructor at the modest The Lettere Room restaurant outside of Gauti, told that he had seen Lamb and Prentiss on 5th September, after Lamb had called for guitar and lipstick for a few audiences.
Nothing in the language meant that nothing was wrong with it.
"A happy couple", Shaffer said.
"We were having fun together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"The deceased Professor Schmidt directed the first year's seminars and had specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell of England.
She was married and had three small children.
He studied at the State of Emporia, U.S.A., and was his own brotherhood and minister of the university.
At the Delta State University Congress in Cleveland, there are 900 people gathered in memory of candlelight, including civil servants, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also participated in a night event where the university choirs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" were presented.
Monday, Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a better day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis are reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Assistant editors: Emily Wagner Traitors in Mississippi and Rebecca Santana New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because it is now being said that Lamb called the emergency call after the shooting of Schmidt, and it was also stated that even though Lamb referred to her as the wife of Prentis in the emergency call, there is, in fact, no evidence for them.
Toys R Us wants to pay for less seasonal workers.
Toys R Us does not intend to hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that we are offering existing workers and seasonal workers the opportunity to work further.
The company intends to hire 40,000 people for stores and centres throughout the country. In 2014, it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
part of the jobs are part-time.
The interviews of applicants will be launched this month, and the employees will begin to take place in December to December.
Although it is still six months for the holiday period, the commercial sector is coming up at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary labour for retailers as well as goods for dispatch and delivery.
Michael J. Fox is laughing about "tretting" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film "Back to Life" was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The following night also had a personal meaning.
"We sat at the theatre and waited for the arrival of the kings. I noticed that there was no place next to me. I learned that Princess Diana is coming to me next to me," said Fox at the trailer of the Back in Time document.
"When the movie began, I realized that the situation was very much like a date with the Princess of Wales."
Back in Time document is related to the film "Back to Life", and in the documents interviews Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielmberg.
The film "Back to the Future" was first seen 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely for me a time travel film of all time," Spielberg said.
Back in Time will be published in the VOD and DVD format and will be presented in the selected cinemas from January onwards.
UN Secretary-General: no solution in Syria.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on the intensified military efforts in the region and notes that there is no common solution to the five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to all people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
In a press conference on Wednesday, Ban announced its intention to meet the two permanent member states of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and the United Kingdom, to discuss Syria. The meeting would take place later this month in the context of the UN General Assembly ministerial week.
Bán regretted the fact that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the forces has led to a situation which has to be resolved.
□ calls on the five Member States to demonstrate, in the context of the Syrian crisis, the same level of solidarity and unity with which the Iranian Treaty was reached.
8th chapter on support surveys: Is Donald Trump serious?
Truming has been tried to label Truming as an empty talker.
He's also the main one.
He can tell Trump about the crash.
In the Republican circles, (the second) results have been achieved in every way to pull Trump off the collar.
Of the eleven national gallons, Donald Trump is assigned two-digit support figures. He was already seriously wondering what it was really about the terms of the real estate mogul.
Of course, the vats are only at the beginning.
No one has yet been informed that Trump will be elected as a candidate for the Republican Republican Republican.
Experts point out that this year, in 2011, Rick Perry, who was at the Gallupäjäy, was given the opportunity to arrive at Herman Cain. Neither of them could have won the election in any of the universes.
In the general elections, Mr Bourne would have several reasons to vote.
External factions such as Jeb Bush Super PAC and the Conservative Group Club for Growth have taken note of the status of Trump and have begun to look after him.
The following recent gallup information shows that no real estate can be accessed by means of an application:
Trump's position has been completely reversed.
As soon as Trump announced that he was going to stand as a candidate on mid-June, according to the gallon of the University of Monmouth, only two of the ten Republicans had a positive image of the real estate mollusc.
By mid-May, 40 per cent of them had a positive image.
In early August, the proportion was 52 per cent.
Now, six of the six Republicans are a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten people have a negative image.
These figures will also be held in the states where the debate will first take place.
Last week in the Quinnimarket Gallup, 60 per cent of the Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two of the three Republics would be pleased with Trump's candidacy.
In the CNN and ORC gallup, the last 67% of Republicans decided to be very pleased or pleased with Trump's potential choice as candidates.
The only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with Trumpic's condition.
Ben Carson has the same enthusiasm as Trump (4% would be very pleased with Carson's terms and 40% of the conditions for Trump's terms).
Who is the next most popular match?
The third is Marco Rubio, the corresponding proportion of which is 21.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be dissatisfied or very dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected candidates for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's mementament to be a problem.
Donald Trump has been widely criticised for his sophistication and insulting comments. 52% of Republican supporters all over the country consider the real estate mogul to be suitable for the market.
The same applies to Iowa, which is the first party to be held: according to the Quick Market Gallup, 52% of Republicans consider the personal effects of Trumpi to be suitable for the Supreme Defence Forces.
However, according to ABC and Post Gallup, 44% believe that Trump is not able to function properly, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament to be inappropriate to the House of the Body.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are consulted, who is most likely to be elected party candidate, according to CNN and ORC gallup, four out of ten believe in Trump's prices.
The situation has changed since mid-May, when four out of ten would have put their money in jail on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Composition: Republics have not previously had a very reliable planet in their use.
In this recent election, four out of the 1st Republican considered Rick Perry to be a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romene.
Most people seem convinced of Trump's campaign.
In fact, the Republicans would support another candidate, Trump covering almost all other candidates.
Part of the experts believe that a disenfranchised camp is likely to be of benefit to the Trump when the opponents of the Trum are awarded support to different candidates.
In early September, Monmouth University's poll survey revealed that in an imaginary double match between Trump and almost any other Republican project, Trump would get a larger support team on his side at all times.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bushia at 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasichia and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
A real opponent for the most important part, Mr. Taruz Trum?
Ben Carson would win a 19-point break from Trump in an imaginary double match.
The vast majority of Trump's support tells us that he has already taken a vote.
According to the alllu published by CBS and NYY on Tuesday, fair half of Trump's supporters are confident of their vote.
Of course, the situation may change for a number of reasons, and at the moment, the speaker can also change his or her mind.
46 per cent of the most protagonists in the world have not made a final decision.
In the past very recently, the competitor is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who have already chosen their candidates are likely to vote twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of six Republicans join Trump's view of migration.
Two months ago, after Donald Trumpin invited to the campaign, the migration from abroad to violence has been a hot topic for 2016.
It is a part of the fact that Trumpi's day-to-day speeches banish important Latin American voters from the Republican population and hinder the branding of the brand.
However, according to the opinions of ABC News and Washington Post published on Monday, six out of the ten Republicans are still on migration issues with Trumpi for the same reasons.
As long as the colony is in the spotlight, there is also Donald Trump.
The dissatisfaction of government is at its top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half the votes of the Republican people.
According to the latest opinion of ABC News and Washington Post, this opinion was expressed by six out of three Republicans.
These two candidates are also angry at others.
According to an opinion survey carried out by Des Moinesșin and Bloombergi Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated at the Republican activity: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% are on the brink."
Jeremy Corbun debuted at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
After the election, the Prime Minister's first appearance at the Prime Minister's request has been looking forward to.
The new film by the working party Labour, the Jeremy Corbini, is scheduled to rise for the first time at David Cameron's question later.
Corby's first six questions will be asked shortly after noon, and the media and the representatives of the working people will follow closely.
Corby has announced less theatre and added the fact to the weekly vote.
He has also found that he may take part in the sitting and leave it to his colleagues.
In the meeting, Corby's leadership will be weighed first, and Corby will be subjected to a public test now following a talk at the TUCC annual meeting on Tuesday.
The decision to keep quiet during the national sitting during the 75th anniversary of the United Kingdom World War on Tuesday has been criticised by several Tory Party representatives. The silence has also come to the headlines of some of the papers.
The silence of Corn during the national sitting attracted attention to Corn's silence.
The Corbyn representative noted the status of Corbyn during the National Singing, with silence in respect of the Sanctuary of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, in the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme, Mr. Owen Smith of Corby's shadow Board, said that he would have called on the President of the Party to join the National Singing against the opposition to this monarchy.
The ten prime ministers have refused to join the Corbyn unit, arguing for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth of the parties supported Corbyn's initial election to the party.
BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant considers that political differences between the United Kingdom and the EU Member States and the conditions for granting governmentary benefits have accumulated in the labour force since the appointment of Corbun.
Corby's TUCC report said that Labour is proposing changes to remove all restrictions.
Hours later, Minister of Labour and Minister of Minister of the Interior, Smith, stated that the party's position was very clear: it only opposes the Government's intention to cut the limit from 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Director-General of Labour that David Cameron has been facing over the past decade under Tory's leadership.
The new policy-promoting Director of Labour says that he has chosen the 30,000 proposals that he has received from the public for Cameron.
According to Corbyn, chosen from the Islington North election, there is too much income in the question, and he promises to avoid clever speech and lobbying, and he says instead that he is addressing serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has stated that Prime Minister Angela Eagle will provide him with Question Time, for example, when Cameron is on his way abroad.
Corby has also expressed the idea that others could sometimes also speak out, and he will talk about the matter with John Bercowal, President of the House of Directors of the European Parliament.
After Corbyn joined the party in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a puppet-made policy that is often linked to the discussion. However, some of the time later he realized that he had failed in his efforts.
Since Question Time was first broadcast in 1990, it has been the main measure of the first-indictment, the management of the lower room and the position. However, according to the findings, the Question Time has become a cartoon that needs major reforms.

The weight is stronger as the wages of the United Kingdom rise.
The pounds increased as wages went up in the United Kingdom, and SABMiller pulled the FTS 100 index up.
In May to July, wages and salaries went up by 2.9 per cent in the United Kingdom compared to the same period last year. Bonuses were not calculated.
Higher than forecast growth was faster than in 2009.
The pound fell to 1 percent, and its exchange rate was quoted at $1,1505. It also increased in proportion to the euro, and it was quoted at 1,3730 euros.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49 per cent and reached 6,229.21 points.

The Burberry stock increased by 0.9% in terms of the combined result of the competing Richemont Group, which focuses on luxury products, in terms of the combined result in the water.

JD Times: higher wage costs could be detrimental to expansion.
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of JD Sport's Executive Board, raising the minimum wage in the United Kingdom would increase the leverage for potential customers.
However, increased leverage is not enough to cover higher labour costs for the operation.
According to Cowgill, the rise in labour costs could jeopardise JD Imports' development plans and reduce the need for increased labour force.
Metcash launches a grass-root campaign against Aldi's belt.
Metcash is trying to secure its IGA store from Aldi's takeover in South and West Australia.
The wholesaler of food Metcash has launched a herb campaign to prevent the market share of IGA retails in South and West Australia against Aldin’s $700 million invasion of Australia.
Aldi will open two distribution centres and first build up up to 120 stores in South and West Australia next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets will build up their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands on the market in mainstream and social media, and organise the Adelaide show-like events.
IGA stores and suppliers, as well as many brands, are involved in the campaign. For example, the ice cream factory Simmo in Dunsborough offers a great deal of customers in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to customers at lower prices for games in the South Australian Gulf League.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the annual investment strategy for food, alcohol and wholesale trade is set up.
This is an important market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of Metcashin IGA bricks, and in some regions the coverage is higher than that of the IGA store in Eastern States.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their population, and IGA traders have a much higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. In South Australia, the market share is 30% and in West Australia, 24%, while in Eastern states it is only 14%.
Morgan Stanley’s analysts, for example, believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the market in the market in the United States within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain will eat from all operators, but especially from operators without chains.
This morning, Dr. Morgan Stayy's analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA dealers could be sold by 360 million and Metcashi by the end of 2016.
The predictions are based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will be selling in the last few hundred million dollars and $600 million.
Metcashi's fixed gains are high, so losing food sales and supplies can result in a loss of $13 million before taxes and taxes, says Kierath.
The same means that Metlist is the market share of the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although according to Roy Morgan's recent research, IGA customers are the most loyal.
132 Stanley believes that Metcashi’s food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4,1 per cent in 2017 and 2,1 per cent in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10,3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, the chief portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Board, Hamish Douglas, told at the event in Melbourne that he would consider it very likely that Metcash would disappear all over the year.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglas' comments.
It should be understood that Mr Metcashi's member contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, the market share of IGA has fallen from 18% to 14%, and the profit of Metcashi, which serves as a retailer in IGA, has decreased by 43% from 2012 levels.
However, a wholesaler will take countermeasures and make more than 150 million USD per year a deposit at the prices of Coles and Woolworths per hundred products per week. The chain supports traders in product update, so that they can increase the supply of fresh goods and improve the quality of the market for food products.
According to Metcashi's CEO, Ian Morrie, prices are under way for the first time in 2017 for the first four years.
Steven Healy, President of the Australian Union of Teens, defends Thanasi from Kokkinakik.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves its behavior rather than the criticism of special mentioning.
According to Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tenors Union, Tranasi Kokkinakis has been a member of the victim's recent association with Nick Kyrgios. Kokkinakis deserves not only the criticism of special mention but also the criticism of special mention.
"Special K", the second largest party named Kokkinakis, was exposed to a bad light when the bad boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent at the Stan Wawrika at the ATP tournament.
Soon after that, in the run-off between the Cocciuts and Ryan Harrison, the judge often asked each other to tell each other about the competition. "Wawrik should have given him and me back to the Torgios and to the guy over there," Mr. Hilson said.
In the open world, Kokkinakis struck a badass in the mail field, when he was killed by the big grabs. Healy has truly defended Kokkinakis.
At present, the telecommunications star is in Glasgow, where he and Sam Groth are fighting for a two-way game behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup in the semi-final against the United Kingdom.
"I strongly believe that your Taiwan has been drawn to the dispute," said Esaly.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the United States. Certainly it is not the one who breaks his country because of his frustration.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative behaviour of Samson in the United States in the open, and I think he deserves to be confessed.
He has a strong man and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature by the age of 19, he works hard and completes a very good team. He has never had any problems with other players, and he's probably among the players. He's working hard, he's good and he's really strong and mature and he's a young man.
Healy also supported the fact that Kyrgios Australia's team is starting to fall from a very important question. Healy saw the solution for a joint decision that works for all parties. However, he supports the return of Canberra's breeder to the team in order to meet the team.
"First of all, we want to focus on the fights in Kyrgios instead of anything else," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As the Feder and Murray have pointed out, the young man will grow in the light of the public. He deserves his criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him so that he understands the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to build his own peace. I believe that it is best for the whole team and for Nick."
European Migration Crisis: In order to declare an emergency, border, arrest migration,
The Hungarian state of emergency closed its southwards from Serbia on Tuesday and caught up with the law of migrants. The purpose was to prevent migration through the law.
There was chaos when hundreds of immigrants were gathered in no country, and the Serbian people were turning around.
People who are refugees will be forced to remain on the road between country stations for an indefinite period of time.
The vanity began to rise to the surface.
While the home computer was flying in the air above the immigrants, these owls "Open the border!" shouted insults to the Hungarian riot police.
He took part in protesting the drinking and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbi wants to be part of the solution, not to cause harm.
The situation has to be discussed in the nearest and also in other countries", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The alarm at the border between Hungary and Serbia began at a time when the group of 28 countries failed to develop a common foreign policy in a controversial debate.
Ministers agree, however, that the responsibility for 40,000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is common. At the meeting, there was a hope that next month, or by the end of the year, an agreement would be reached on which EU Member States would receive 120,000 immigrants, including the United States.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Academy convened an extraordinary summit on Tuesday for the next week to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
However, it did not wish to see action taken quickly or in neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the crisis developed so that in two of the southern regions, more efficient means were put in place, i.e. shutting down you and legal processes in the field of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stated that Hungary is also planning a wire fence across Romania to prevent the flow of migration from the point of view, now that there is already a fence at the border with Romania.
CBS wrote by Charlie D'Agata, CBS, who reported that you were still in prison for the final notice of prices for barbed wires between the United States and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a new pillar and a transit point for the European Union. Many of these immigrants are refugees of Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people who arrive are equal refugees, not refugees who have the right to protection.
According to the new law that came into force in the Middle East, it is a crime to cross or harm a four-metre high-end wire fence built on the southern edge of Serbia. The law also provides for longer prisons for convicted human traffickers.
"For the sake of the causes of mass migration, he declared a crisis situation in the country," the public informant Zoltan Kovács told journalists in Szeged, south of the country.
"We're following a tight line: crossing the law is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt the military measures that we are looking for next week. The editors of the Associated Press office at the border have, for several days, been seeing seriously armed soldiers with their own vehicles and with their gender dogs.
Orban's Internal Security Adviser Gyorgy Bakoki said that they have caught a cross of 45 borders immediately at the border and 15 more.
The people who have crossed the border are now under control, and they are accused of crimes under law.
The authorities are speeding up their work.
Two cross-border border crossing points at national borders were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday. One border crossing point was closed by means of a wagon covered with a straw wire.
Kaost took over the main border crossing point near Roske, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small machine store to the point where people packed in.
About 20 came in, but thousands were excluded.
A second group of Americans, who are united in the main state of the country and the United States, all reported themselves in a food and drink strike until they get there.
Electoral 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership over Bernie Sanders turned half of the national gallup, according to the national gallupe.
The support rate for the former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still two-digit in the race for the international presidential candidate for democracy, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed his distance.
Clinton's support now accounts for 47% of the voters' vote (58% of the votes cast), compared with the second 27% of the votes cast (a 17% increase).
Vice-President Joe Bide has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential contest, and his support for the Democrats is 15%.
It is too early to tell which candidate they are in favour of five months before the premises for the majority of democracies.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their choice than other candidates.
Since the Gallup in CBS News last month, Clinton has lost the support of a number of democratic groups, while the Sanders camp has been joined by new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership in the male and moderate, but the leadership is narrowed down.
Clinton's support for men has fallen considerably, and he only has a 5% look at Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership over 50-year-old demons, and he is now at the same level as Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a minor advantage over older voters.
In the last month, Clinton's balance of support for Sanders among the liberals was two-digit, but now Sanders has taken four points to Clinton's neck in this group.
About half of the Democrats would be happy to announce their support to Clinton if they were elected candidates for the party.
A fourth would support Clintoma with a small reserve, and 15% would only support him because he is one.
The moon would not support Clint.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would also be particularly keen to support if he was elected as a candidate.
There is more breakdown in the views of those who are currently not in favour of Clinton. Just about a fourth of them would be eager to support him.
In turn, only 35% of the Republicans would be eager to support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
Once the Clinton voters are free to describe why they are in favour of his candidacy, the most popular argument is Clinton's right experience (16%). The second most popular answer is that it is time to be a resident (13%) and the third is that Clinton is the best second time (10%).
Clinton's supporters also refer to Bill Clinton (9 %) as his contact.
I would also like to mention the common views and ways of enabling the actual elections to be held.
The vice-president still had a chance to land in the candidacy, and 57% of the democraticists would expect him to go in the race.
When asked about the second most popular candidates for the party candidate, the majority chooses Biden.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half Biden is, after Clinton, the most popular and most popular of all Sangers.
If Biden does not go to the democratic race, Hillary Clinton will increase his distance from Sanders. In the case of Salers, the distance will be 20 points, and it will increase to 30 points if Sanders does not go on a race.
55% of the Democrats consider Clinton to be a candidate, who has the best chance of winning the actual elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
The second Biden is away from Clinton, but the second one believes in Biden's winnings the actual finals.
However, the democraticists consider the views on matters to be the most important factor in the success of candidates.
voters do not consider it impossible to accept democratically or potential candidates.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate in their characteristics.
The majority of them consider Clint, Sangs and Bids to be games, reliable and competitive.
In most cases, biden is understood in the second place, while Clinton is considered to be the most common type.
Up to 30% of the democraticists think Clinton is true and reliable, but Sanders are 15%. 27% can't tell if Sanders is honest.
In the opinion of the democraticists, Clinton, Sanders and Biden are of the opinion that the views of the voters are close to their own ideology.
For all characteristics, about a quarter of them have no opinion of Sanders.
When you ask the voters for their views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private email and its component as Foreign Minister, most of the voters welcome Clinton's explanation, and it has not altered the views of these voters on Clinton.
The people of the United States are of the utmost opinion.
Half of the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only a third is upset.
In February, when the conflict had just come to light, the public was concerned about the fact that the conflict had just come out.
The majority of Americans believe that the use of contentious use is not affected by their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed over time.
Of this 36%, the majority, four out of ten, are Republicans.
In the case of the parties who hold Clinton as true and reliable, there is room for improvement in these characteristics when all the authors' views are asked: Clinton must be true and only available at 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all the voters, 62% do not consider Clinton to be true and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters in the whole country do not consider Trumps to be real and reliable either.
However, both Clinton and Trump receive good grades of leadership.
The six remaining candidates Biden, Carson and Bush were considered to be the most reliable.
Most people hold the Sanders true, but just like Carson, many people do not have a Sanders opinion.
The sample of the survey is 351 votes in favour and the margin of the sample is 6 percentage points.
Benson will be able to close the distance between Donald Trump and the national support poll.
According to the latest support poll of CBS News and New York Times, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trump.
These two candidates decided more than half of the votes cast in the new debate, and the remaining candidates were behind long distances.
As far as the whole country is concerned, Trump still has strong support. The share of the contribution has risen from 23% of the CBS survey, which was conducted before the debate held in Fox News last month.
However, Carson's support went up at the same time, from 6% to 23%.
It was said that Carson has strong support for all groups of the population.
Other terms and conditions, except Car Fiorina and Governor of Ohio, John Kasich will remain far away. The support of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is weak and has fallen from 10% to 2% for the last month now.
Former President of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee and Senator of Florida, Marco Rubio, shared a total of 6% in favour.
The error margin of 376 in the Republican rector's sample is 6% or more. The survey was carried out in September.
According to the latest poll published by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is under way, 19% of the Republicans, while Trump's support is 32%.
In the latest review of the ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was firmly in charge of Carson.
Last week, during the meeting, Trump struck an impeccable attack on a retired neurosurgeon, but he asked for forgiveness after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last night in his campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the Board accused of the death of the Baruchy Fund.
Almost two years ago, after the ritual of the division in Poconovuori in Pennsylvania, three people are charged with murder charges.
The members of the Department of Pi Delta Psi of the City University of New York (City University of New York) were brutally at Chu's "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to them, the department did not deliver Deng in time to a hospital which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes were tied, his back had been pinned by a backpack covered with sand of nearly 15 kg, and he had been subjected to an easy attempt to reach the target located on the other side of the ice field.
Dengin is first told about his head and then he has lost consciousness.
According to the police, the members of the Pi Delta Ps department did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, which is said to be waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Prime Minister Chris Wabner reported at the press conference that, however, the members tried to change Deng's movements, go after him and contact the chairman of the meeting Andy Mengi.
"In this time, they tend to hide their instruments, putting the interests of the department ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner noted.
Deg could not be revived, and he died the next morning.
According to the Mortgage Protocol, Dengi had been found several times in the head, the upper body and the travels with a boring object.
"A lot of families have been shocked by the blockage of the department, as at least one month is dead as a result of the mutilation since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng's family, in his statement.
The responsibilities of the bodies and their members must be given to the need to take an important step.
The Grand Jury of the City of Monroe has appointed five members of the district to charge the second instance of murder.
In addition, 32 members will be charged with impunity and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to be held accountable not only for the third party, but also for the body that officially or informally adopted the sleigh," Wagner told us at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College imposed a division on the operation of the division, and the State Department signed up to the operation of the local unit.
The rise in the central bank's (Fedin) exchange rates is affected by the rise in the Central Bank's (Fedin) interest rates.
The increase in interest rates and the stock market in the day-to-day period are tenuous, the return on securities is rising and the economy is fluctuating.
That's it.
We don't even know how long and how long they'll last.
As far as the economy is concerned, we have a history of timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first increase in the number of payments and has gone up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises aggressive interest rates, not always. The determining factor is the way in which the economy and financial assets are managed.
The central administrators have already been very stressed that investors would not be paying attention to the fact that they are starting to raise costs, as far as the normalisation of the situation is concerned.
Of course, there are other variables involved.
In the end, however, market operators may notice that any increase in interest rates may be excessive.
"The first rise of the central bank after the global financial crisis was often interpreted as a sign of the end of the cheap money", Julian Jessop, the chief bank's main global economicist, once again.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates to a rather low level, which is a shock to many people who are not in a position to be able to avoid.
It does not mean, however, that there would be no action.
Here are historical trends based examples of how the effects can be reflected in different economic areas:
It has been seen on the market for the past six months, and an increase in interest rates may increase upwards for a period of time.
When the heels rise, it's not that dramatic.
"It would appear that there would be a trend towards a return on capital on foreign exchange after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, which in turn reflects the delay in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank's analysis found in a recent review of the effects of the rise in interest rates.
In particular, over a period of 35 years, there is a sharp rise in the market, around 14%, moderate next 250 days (average 2.6%), after 500 days the situation is normalising, and the average revenue after six stock ratios is 14.4%, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management, based on a single strategy in the Barron's magazine.
According to the fact, the effect on the shares will generally increase at a slightly later stage and interest income will start to decline.
The recession is a fact, but an increase in interest would usually do so.
In this case, if the central bank encounters circumstances that did not exist before and which could stimulate the calculation adjustment.
In particular, it is important that the GDP is at least at the very least in view of the central bank's increase in the interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 11th annual interest rate increases, only twice the nominal value has been less than half of a percent.
The second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it to last, and the third quarter is 1.5 per cent, says the beginning of Atlanta.
In the event of an increase in interest rates in this economic situation, there may be a risk and whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about raising the interest rate all year round, and the views are going to turn to the meeting of the Open Market Committee this week, which will end on Thursday.
The strategies and economic operators believe that, even if the Open Market Committee were to adopt an opinion at this time, it is only 25% likely that the general market would be open to competition.
"In our studies since 1950, all the lifting cycles until now have been in the supercycle, where also before the downward trend rises very quickly after the tide has started," says the report.
The recovery has been very recent in comparison with the worst depression in the period of comparison.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, and now it is now going to be 74 months.
As well as stable-income securities have been unstable in the past, the market continues to raise interest rates, and the formula also recurs on the other hand.
"The fundamental difference is that the effect on the bonds is more rapid than on the shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
In the case of bonds, the process appears to change the direction as soon as the first round/scroach starts.
At the end of the rise period, the yields will be calculated immediately," said Deutsche.
Charles Schwab's strategyists believe that the weighting will bring long and short-term bonds closer to each other and the curve to balance.
"High-income bonds are much better in this environment, although we are still moderate in terms of income," said Schwab's paper analyst Kathy Jones.
Selectively, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future changes in central government finances.
"In addition to strengthening the dollar and forecasting, there are already a number of signs of aggravating financial policy", says Jones.
The short-term interest rates are running, the yield rate is direct, the credit risk margins are expanded and the volatility of the stock market is increased, and everyone is market-typical in a situation where the bank tightens up policies.
The large-scale companies, which are mainly active in the market, will be able to benefit as the ratio decreases and local products are starting to play their part.
The standards of debtors’ multinationals are worse, as the strong dollar makes them fall on the global market and on the debt decline.
"The history shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs’ analysts tell their customers.
Companies whose balance sheet is strong beat the weak balance sheet companies by an average of five percentage points after interest payments in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with a high return on capital, as well as low-voltility shares, were also better than quality, with an average of 4 and 3 percentage points, respectively.
"This is a big question.
Enterprises with a significant share of the variable rate debt will lose the most," Goldman noted.
In general, consumers in the market within the share market also benefit from the strengthening of the USD.
Savings will also benefit from a higher yield.
Political Committee Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 on Classic FM 2nd floor.
Conservative Mr Bingham criticises the situation of excessive popularity.
According to Bingham, the channel is now being created by its commercial competitor.
He also claims that the BBC Music Awards Awards is only a copy of the Brits Gala.
In turn, Mr Damien, in turn, is responsible for the personal infidelity of The Voice channel.
According to a major civil society, BBC Radio 3 will be transformed into a second channel called the Classic FM, and the evidence will increase the pressure to prove that there is more to offer every other station in the world.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told BBC that the broadcaster’s radio channel is becoming too popular and is no longer being able to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularity, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
Last December’s BBC Music Awards Award Gala will be critical of Bingham:
"For the first time in the last year, the BBC Music Awards, organised for the first time, seem to be the second of the British Prize Awards.
These are examples of the fact that instead of the new and the present, they only mimic what is already on the market," says Bingham.
The BBC president denied the attacks and concluded that BBC Radio 3 offers a much more live music and enlightening content than a commercial trader.
"From Radio 3, I learn from classical music something I can't learn from other channels.
The commitment of the channel to live music and music is entirely in its own language.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 has also committed itself to finding new music and new works," he said.
Last year, Director of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, stated that the position must work harder to keep public interest in public interest, for the British know classical music better than before.
However, Radio 3 has not been the only one who has been critical of entering the territory of commercial channels in consultation with the BBC network, the restricted Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
On the Tory-Sun Week, Damien Collins criticised The Voice’s ability search, which BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Yilta. The price for the sale is GBP 22 million.
"The programme is not being discussed at all, because it is not unique or particularly distinct."
According to Lord Hall, the BBC1 programme, which is the stardust of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was produced by BBC in the same way as BBC.
In addition, it will require you to look for a hit in your own way when it launches a new show of entertainment for the next time.
However, he did not agree to rule out the fact that The Voice series would continue to be ordered or that taxpayers' money would be used for other forms of entertainment.
Increase in online commerce at all times in August – caused by
In the second months of 2015, online trade was recorded as a percentage of the number of months.
e-commerce sales have been recorded since 2000. Last month growth was the slowest in all times.
The online trade strengthened three years ago, following a teleshopping process.
Experts believe that a man who's a black guy can be a shopping man.
Over the past ten years, online commerce has been evaporating many of the UK’s shopping shops.
According to experts, there are indications that the online market is stabilised and that only 7% of GDP growth is recorded in the third month of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was at the lowest in the whole period since online sales have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. in the last year, only one-fifth of the total sales were recorded.
According to experts, there are indications that the online market is stabilised and that only 7% of GDP growth is recorded in the third month of 2015.
"If last year's growth is compared to the 2000 mark, it is clear that growth will be restored over time", ImRG editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahyn, online commerce increased three years ago, when consumers generated mobile purchases.
"It made the most of it able to buy online, and for many, buying was possible in different environments, for example, at home with a hand.
"When mobileisation is now more moderate, growth can be stabilised."
Black black from America is a phenomenon that is considered to be one of the causes of the slowdown in growth.
According to experts, the day to be taken on the last Tuesday can make it possible for you to postpone the purchase decision before Friday.
Last year the number of online buyers allowed to access the average of the number of transactions that many traders are looking for.
Experts believe that anyone who makes consumers check out their bids can afford to buy in the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail consortium, a fair pound of each of the five pounds was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and computers, are purchased online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of shopping fashion shops.
We are burying the victims of uplifting accidents, the responsibility of Bin Laden.
The Muslims carried 29 bodies on the streets when the first funeral is held in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia claims that Saudi Binlain Ry, the major construction company of Saudi Arabia, is part of the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the crane fell.
In the high air, the mules were carried when the Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims of the crane that had fallen on Mecca's Grand Moscone.
In Kadu, a number of people had gathered in the middle of the country to leave their victims behind at the late end of the Al-Maisim cemetery.
The cemetery went through a pilgrimage site where only a day earlier the fallen building crane had penetrated through the roof of the mushkija on top of the Muslims.
The Governor of Saudi Arabia ordered Bin Laden to be held responsible for an accident involving a further 394 people.
The bodies of the 29 dead victims of the Mecca's Grand Moscow's Assassination Accident were transported on the streets.
Among the dead of Nostruri was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great-Manchester, who had gone to Mecca in his first pilgrimage.
Akram had been involved in the Grand Moscow with his parents who were about to attend their annual hajj-sacre journey.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that the hajj pilgrimage will be held when some people are now arriving in town for refugee purposes.
According to King Salman, the Binlatin Group should not have left the lifting boom up when the crane was not made.
According to the Arabic press release, Binlatin City is part of the accident.
The U.S. U.S. service did not provide a detailed report on the matter. However, according to the English information, the management of the group is prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this year, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Grand Moscow. Thousands of Muslims are heading for the Great Moscow's hajj-sacre later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a notice on the lift accident and the members of the Group are not intended for the purpose of the opinion.
The king also accused the group of not complying with the up-to-date safety regulations and working with the meteorology.
Tens of the cranes are in use as part of the Binladin Group's major building project.
For ten years, Bin Laden's family has been in close contact with the Saudi Arabian ruling family, and Bin Ladens are responsible for a number of important construction projects.
The late President of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, had abandoned him in the 1990s.
The uplift that occurred in the heavy rain and in the harsh mood took place just a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is to do at least once in the course of life the duty of every conscious Muslim is to do at least once in a lifetime.
According to the authorities, 1 person is still in hospital care.
The authorities ordered a number of counts (approx. EUR 250 000) for victims' families and those permanently disabled.
The injured persons in the event of a change will receive half of the amount of compensation.
According to the B+Q boss, behind the street is a cheap Eastern Europe
The British employ more often than the general public in the home," says Veronique Laury.
The popularity has been increased by those who come from Eastern Europe, those who work as professionals.
More than 200 new screenfix stores for workers will be opened.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher closes the 60 B+Q store around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, editor-in-chief, Daily Mail
British are told to transfer home ironing and painting to factors coming from Eastern Europe.
Today, ironing and painting skills seem to be rare.
The British are now more and more likely to employ the home's public to handle the work of the home, says the president behind the B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new CEO in Kingfishher, who owns the retail chain of home refurbishment products. According to Laury, professional workers from Eastern Europe are behind the phenomenon, who offer the highest prices.
As a result of the phenomenon, Kingfisher is going to open 200 new business-to-business Screenfix stores, while 60 B&Q stores will be shut down.
Laury needs more work force for B&Q bricks, for four out of the eight buy-in decisions are made at the store.
Most of the staff are currently men.
According to Laury, there is a need to take into account the population order, since the most lonely woman in the world is still in the process of renovating her home.
"The staff of our chemicals is still mostly human," says Laury.
"We have a right to take action.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of our products are made up of purchasing decisions.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of the five women who are at the top of the British FTSE 100, and she has also re-organised the management board so that there is a level playing field between men and leaders.
Courtfisher is the only type, with 50% of its posts being equal to 50%, including the Executive Director and the Executive Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury said.
"It has not been difficult to find a good lead."
Bankfisher's half-yearly operating profit and sales figures are falling, even though working hard after closing down the stores was done.
Bankfisher responds to current developments: the company owns Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open up 200 new stores.
The three women decided to resort to a coercive law to save the economy.
Visual effects are expected to be quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SAK and other CICs began to turn immediately, and the country is lying down because of the widespread manifestation of workers.
Many people also believe that there is reason to be.
Let's ask if it's worth a strike when each one goes badly.
A resistance business has even been established.
Over 50,000 people are already reporting that they are not going to participate in the protest but are going to work.
For the good old consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet where you protest, but openly declaring yourself true would have been a human being.
One million-member trade unions, thousands of protests by thousands of people, do not repeat much, but it gives cause for thought.
The status of the online communications movement is no longer as clear as it was twelve years ago.
Not all are familiar with the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement’s operation, Government’s radical decisions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have been showing up on their own for years, then, of course, in connection with matters such as the right to defend, be aware and correct.
In this way, the government may want to hold back the role of the ay movement, when membership in the trade union is often seen as the most important in the past.
Whatever the opinion of the organisations is, it's nonsense that one's expression would somehow end up in Finland.
Finland has long since returned to Finland.
For example, industrial production has been down 31 months in a row for example.
Gross domestic product continues to fall and unemployment is increasing.
Things are supposed to force everything to the head.
The University of Lappeenranta is a hard-to-use economy: Aim for a million savings, with 130 employees.
The Technical University of Lappeen Beach is starting a continuum, which aims to reduce costs by a total of EUR 1 000.
□ the Commission's proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) amending Regulation (EEC) No 4077/92 on the common organisation of the market in agricultural products.
In practice, it means about 130 employees.
Other activities are also intended to save a lot of money.
In the context of the single market negotiations, the 2016 budget, which foresees that the actual functioning of the budget is a total deficit.
The budget of the Government is also responsible for this.
This year, the university will spend approximately 2.6 million consecutive years.
In the first instance, the growth rate is low, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry is reduced by 2 and other funding by 3.2 euros.
The total budget of the university is about 85 euros, which means that the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combination of massive education and research interventions and corporate finance with our university is very important," says Rector Anneli Pauli, in his report.
The effects of the interventions appear to be even more pronounced before the summer, but now the reduction in the number of interventions will appear in new proportions.
The compromises with the judges will be launched next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as prescribed by the law.
Yle: Happy is what Finland wants to do for the rest of the world.
The owner of Onnibus, British Sir Brian Souter, tells Yle that the company also aims for rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in going to Finland for rail transport.
My Stagecoach is one of the largest railway companies in the UK, Souter says.
Rail is expected to be open to competition in the future.
One of the next short-term economies of the metropolitan area is in 2017-2018.
There will be long-distance transport after transport.
Soutter tells us that he has already approached the Ministry of Economy.
In the transport sector, YLE says that Onnibus's plans are welcome.
Other international public interest in rail transport has been expressed at least by Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport in Europe.
The time of the balance sheet of the Central Bank’s balance sheet is fixed at the time of the balance sheet.
The whole world will be following the US Fed meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time in the next decade.
More than half of the economists who still thought the central bank would raise interest rates last month are now betting on the central government’s average level of between 0 and 0,25% at present, as shown by the survey by the Reuters 80 economists.
"This is a historic situation, for the Central Bank has been in the dark for seven years now.
For the first time, we are approaching a method where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from an equal level and thus trigger the normalisation of the ratios," said Angel Ubide, a senior researcher at the Institute for International Communications.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and the recovery has brought back billions of additional dollars in the balance sheet and caused little inflation.
However, the Centre cannot ignore a global situation that is not as rosy as it is.
It has called on the market to change, but there are also references to the opposite.
The decision is due to be taken on Thursday, 2:00 in the middle of the time period.
The Delta State University shooter gave me an apology card.
After shooting in Mississippi on Monday morning — before the first shooting later that day — Shannon Lamb sent a message in which he asked for the first murder and hoped to cancel, they told me on Tuesday.
In the Mississippi Gautier, Delta State, a math and social science teacher, the Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday morning and told me that I shot a man.
Lamb asked the police to go home in a cell phone call.
"I shot my wife last night", she told me, and she also told me that there was a friend in the house who is not bad for anyone but who is probably scared.
He asked for the name of the cop, but he didn't.
Lamb also had no motive for shooting.
To get to the place of destination and find Amy Prentiss, 41, man and Lamb hand-written a message that reads as follows: "I am very sorry and I wish that I could cancel what I did.
I was afraid of Amy, and she's the one who ever loved me."
After writing the message, he passed a mile away to Delta University, where he met the professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, before he doubted himself late on Monday, when he reached him.
University principal William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lamb was concerned about something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb believed that Prentiss was also in a romantic relationship with Schmidt. However, the authorities announced on Tuesday that there was no information or evidence about the three-thirty period.
Mr. Prentiss and Mr. Shawn O'Steen, who spent seven years with him, once again claimed to be a good man.
The couple were divorced 15 years ago but gone.
O'Steen told me that she and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's upset.
According to him, the mother and the mother were the best of the best of them.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss's, Lindsay Knowles, told me that Prentiss worked online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years.
"he always tried to help others," Knowles said.
According to him, Lamb had called the families during Monday and told them that he was not going to go down.
When the police stayed at Lambin Highpoint 1 close to the Supervale at the same time, Lamb stopped the car, escaped on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to a CV at the university site, Lamb received a doctorate in educational science at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Shortened stars.
The last few years have been serious for an actor (in the picture on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also been struggling with the drugs, and in 2009 he was arrested for arrest.
The process has really required its taxes.
On the other hand, the number of months left over for two thirds of the month.
The right foot of Shaw broke down at the United Nations Masters League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defenseman will be sorry to be absent for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that today will return to the field for this period.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the bad control of Hüktor Moreno in the PSV protection zone when the game was in progress for fifteen minutes.
What was given first aid in the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two legs, and he's in hospital," Van Gaal said.
Let's go tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for a run.
A young man who joined the row at 18 years of age has experienced hard times and is now getting caught up in great games.
In a suit, the acid was given to Shaw.
A man crying.
I'm not a doctor, but when the head breaks from two points, he's side by side for half a month, and he's no longer playing in the segment.
I'm sure he'll still be able to do it this season.
Moreno seemed to have made it anywhere when he didn't follow the red card with a penalty effect.
The waiter Nicola Rizzol did not punish the Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian importer made a mistake.
"You try to decide for yourself, but I think that the situation was worth the discipline and the red card.
It was a two-legged bail-out of two legs."
"Thank you for all your messages, and I couldn't describe how crushed I am. My recovery begins here and I will come back stronger."
On the other hand, you can find more information on how to get on the page in the PSV vote.
The defenseman has one reason to recover in order to compete at the European Championships in France in June.
"This is a very serious injury," said the PSV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The purpose of the policies is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his head while playing in the order of the World Cup in the World Cup of 2014 in the Van Gaal piloted the Netherlands.
"He's very sorry, because he didn't mean to hurt the enemy. I'm sorry to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu says.
"I didn't see it coming.
All I saw was the ball that was going in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) was going into the ball, but I didn't see Luke's takla."
"I know what it means. I know how difficult this can be," Moreno said to SBS6.
"I feel really sorry for you. I'm very sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris S Model.
I mean, Cameron should know Lorax better than Lorax.
At one time, the child learns his/her favorite book from the outside.
You saw David Cameron.
When a child’s mandate asked Cameron for his favorite of his pet’s children’s books, he asked Lorax, Dr. Seuss’s teaching environmental story, published in 1971.
In the text published on the SuperCamp web site, Cameron writes that the selection was poor. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it is full of messages. I will read it to myself, because there is always some image or message that we have not noticed before."
It is clear that the next point where Cameron intends to describe the book's creation is the 2012 film language summary, which added new characters and details to the next short article.
"Where true trees and plants are lost, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, who wants to dream into the heart of the girl by carrying out this greatest dream: see the right tree," says the text. In 1991, Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died, Ted had no object of wonder.
Unless there is enough doubt about this, Cameron's text is partly in line with the intended summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database. It says: "In the long term, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted, who wants to get into the heart of his dream girl."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems likely that the plan of the book would be so strange to me. Ahne Kerskanen loses trees and manufactures them in spite of the responses from the name-named Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, mustache creature that protects forests.
Most likely, such as this, a minor pr-task has been entrusted to assist, i.e. someone who has not read Lorax 20 times in a tube,
The Prime Minister's representative announced that the text was likely to come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps did not comment more specifically but confirmed that the text was the subject of Cameron staff.
Adam Lyth was certainly in no danger of getting away from the team, but it's still tough.
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but seeing as we see a team on the tour, a second review of the last 3-0 Test series is not expected.
I wouldn't shut down the possibility of a foreign visit.
Alastair Cook's side can be more elusive than a three-year-old team, but there are good players on the team and the team is strong – they have no bad idea about 2012; they only have a young idea.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a threaded feeder, and Adil Rashid, although he does not have a test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped out of the Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales.
To leave Adam Lyth out is obviously an understanding of his head coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Testes have been two good attacks against challenging circumstances, and the simple and true truth is that gamers are judged according to the results of the review.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have previously told you – players are the best testers.
The other 50 points would have been on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
He's trying to get a new one when he hits the Yorkshire with more runs.
The head coach of the world, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me.
Consider how long the Test-Aid gets a chance to make an impression is likely.
Lyth received seven earthquakes — like his mother Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Compton only got one at both the home and the guest fights.
The only issue of the complaint may be that the English Jonathan Trot was first used in the study – when Lyth was in high order – but this past is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team, and he's a bat with a high score.
He is an unknown author of cricket, which we saw in Yorkshire last time this month, when he made 246 points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be allowed at least the same time as his supporters, but this is, of course, due to the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea of Moe starting a relationship with Cook has been cast into the air, when we get the extra percussion in the game while we have four speed eaters, and I am not against the idea.
I don't see any obstacle to the fact that a co-feeder could be standing here, and this left-handed player has already proved himself to be a big gamer.
Moe may not have made much of a local team in Worcestershire, but he's been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played the first 38 test matches in the first replacement game before starting in 2001.
He made three hundred points right away, and there was no return.
Zafar Assari is on the team as a backup feeder, and based on what I've seen, he's proved to be a very busy man.
The players can look at his statistics – 31 points in the punch and 35 points in the pitch – and this can be a search shot, but quite a lot of cyclists have not shown themselves to be ready, and the authors have decided to take the game.
He learned a lot during this transition.
Outside the team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its training staff.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan killer, Mpool Jayawardenen, as an adviser to the Test matches may be through.
This is one of the rarest men of the species who brings much experience, because he has played under all circumstances and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood will become a part of the ball of the game, including both energy and loss of energy.
I think that he is always involved in the right international cricket, whether he is a player or a coach, and that he has a sense to use in the mind of Mahela.
A new sound in the dressing room, even if it says the same as before, can be a boost injection.
Colly's team blood in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been resting for one day in a match, Root got the same time against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Not all of them agree, the trainers and the voters do not set a timetable.
And it should be borne in mind that, like players, each of them is the result of their job performance.
These changes will never be done without exception.
The Brexit Camp can be won if the economy is upset in 2017
David Cameron's half-way renegotiation strategy for keeping the United Kingdom in the EU is now in a deeper swamp today, even without a desire to be pleased, even if Corbini chooses to run the workforce or TUC to drive Europe hard on Tuesday.
In other countries too, they have their own Inby and Nigel Farags.
The European diplomat recently explained how many crises the European Union is in – not all of them are their own, and some Member States have become aware of the British self-righteous agenda, which is the subject of a disagreement between concessions and the amendments to the Treaty that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the annual TUC decided that they, too, did not like the EU, if it deduces social protection.
Let's just call it Dave and George's Selfie Agency.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor will be present at summits and bilateral negotiations in different capitals in different countries, will take a picture of themselves in the face of a famous monument, with or without higher rank, will return home and tell them that they have made federal reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants the open-minded UK inside the EU tent. "Don't talk to us alone with the United States," says Berlin and suggests that even more common-sighted politicians and officials in different capitals have come to the point that he doesn't care if we stay or go.
Angela Merkel, a prudent German Chancellor is a federal but has been in existence for ten years and wants to resign before it is contaminated, as happened to those who were too late: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (106).
François Holland is in the process of re-electing or selecting a follow-up in 2017.
Their power is fading.
The field may soon have a national government, a left-wing government, and a left-wing government.
It is hard to imagine them running around helping selfie Brits, who could use their powers better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom. Nor do they want it, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
Some of these ministers may be planning to make meaningful comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the United States of America in 2017 in a public election that wants to run the Brexit process, my friend proposes.
"The new negotiations had been held." "The United Kingdom had nothing to do with the new negotiations."
Europeans know how British press gets on the list and how EU-sceptic on-the-art magazine is, as did the 'Years' vote by Tony Benn, which resulted in a 2:1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Some may well remember far from Boris Johnson, an eloquent Euro-opportunist, who became known as "our EU direct bananas correspondent" in Brussels in the 1990s.
Ediband at least opposed his enemy.
These include taxes, tax evasion, hacking, and apparently temporary pensions, which own most of our good newspapers.
As a matter of fact, the second most important of all, but then he realized that when he's in a cage with a rough gorge, he had to turn bananas into a distraction so that the gorge wouldn't let you go for lunch and day.
Miliband was even more brilliant than Blair in his opposition to the referendum.He admitted himself to the EU Constitution, which was then rejected.
Never will they ever give up on God’s forgiveness.
Comfortable Jeremy Corby, who killed me naturally back at Westminster on Monday. I told him that I did not have time to spend on me anymore. There may be a danger that he would introduce the Neil Pintock media boycott strategy in the '80s. It was a mistake and it is still there.
It may take time, but Corbyn has to work out a consistent strategy for social dialogue with the media. Not with me, but Andrew Marri, who was sitting in the Bible with the BBC staff.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we kindly call a building.
He says he wants to keep us in the reformed EU.
Most of the people in Ukip and Tory are likely to be able to do this.
That's what Hilary "Benn, but not Bennit" Benn told me on the radio and on the screen here, when his internal Boy Scout was trying not to be called "the Warden John McDonnell".
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father was right to be in a position to be in a position to be in a position to be loyal to his Labour Parliaments, without being too far away and without losing it in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Ben said that he would oppose staying in the EU "in all circumstances" McDonnel does not mean that neither to Corby's colleagues or to the members of the House in private meeting on Monday evening.
You want Corby to care about how much the picture of the miracle is, you have to remember that he even touched me. Vibration is important for a period of 24/7, especially in the discipline of the common media, where sickness and fraud occur.
Cameron does not need to be given a free EU passport in which he could take the support of Labou clearly in the vote, as McDonnell has pointed out.
Simon Jenkins is of the opinion that is the case.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equivocation of EU membership of the EU was, of course, incorporated into the insular economy and against the history of capitalism.
The equivocation has also been seen in Nato. Tom Watson is shocking that Mr. Corby did not campaign for his departure. Foreign diplomats must try to clarify the matter to their country of origin.
Why do you think I'm going to have to waste a lot of money?
The United States is already quite disappointed with the terrible media activity of Britain in Iraq, Bangkok and Syria, even during the Tory Government. I was reminded on Monday of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British authorities' opinions on co-financing.
According to the investigators, the state-funded institution's claims that 95 % less harmful than traditional smoking is the result of the fact that 12 of the 12 participants are involved in the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence provided by the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and the Lancet Medical Journal in the report on e-ciency by the Public Health Authority Public Health Authority (PHE) on e-cigarettes.
PHE described last month's publication in his report "for a review of the work done and the work done".
However, a number of researchers have suspected the security of information and have highlighted some of the links to the illicit activity.
Last month, in the headwriting of the Lancet Medical Journal, the teeth were "a very subtle basis", on which the PHE's main conclusion was based.
In addition, two researchers at BMJ have asked whether the arguments were based on "gold or sand".
The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell of the University's Meeting Epidemiology, have concluded: "The basic assumption of public administration is that the policy principles are based on clear evidence of their impact."
According to Mckeen and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "at the current best estimate, the investments are about 50% less harmful than conventional projects" should be based on a detailed analysis and inventory of the results of the research.
You claim to be one of the 12 meetings convened for the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model. The model was intended to bring together participants' views on the sharks of nicotine products.
According to Mikeen and Capewell, support for the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, which has been funded by British American Tobacco (BAT) according to sources.
The Executive Director expressed his support for BAT’s public health activities in the sustainability report.
12 participants in the meeting provided funding from an electric power producer. However, the alleged financing by Philip Morris International was not granted by any of the participants in the joint venture company Philip Morris International.
However, there are a number of supporters for escillating escillating smokes, some of which are eligible for funding from industry.
However, some of the participants are not aware of their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's anti-PHE meeting.
According to Mikeen and Capewell, one of the research reports shows that there is no controversial evidence of the adverse effects of products on a wide range of products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, policies or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to the PHE report, so far, it has not been established that co-mortgage may contribute to the smoking of children or non-smokers. Mckee and Capewell are not considered to be premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, Director for Health and Welfare of PHE, the arguments have been answered in the past.
According to Fenni, co-investments are at least less harmful than traditional smoking.
Each of the people who live through life will die because of the addiction of the tobacco industry.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of efficiencies are lower than those of modern tobacco. However, the current effects need to be examined more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform the public of what evidence is and what it does not indicate, especially in a situation where the relative risks from the comparison of the raw material are unclear.
In the United States there are almost 80,000 deaths involving smoking, and smoking costs to public health care of £2 billion a year.
Responsible action requires that we clearly present the current evidence that the transactions are not a risky option, and the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the effects of raw tobacco.
BBC has to give up on EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, who was head of Channel 4, has found that BBC should make it possible for certain programmes to be sent, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand from hit-and-runs, such as Albert Square.
According to Johnson, the fee should only be used for the purpose of carrying out programmes that are not carried out by other media.
He criticises BBC for the presentation of programmes likely to reach the smallest audience, at the same time as the large audiences of competitors, as well as the BBC, for example, on the BBC network.
When Director-General Tony Hall of the BBC had announced that the company wanted to increase its cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years to get Channel 4 cooperation with BBC, to learn about it.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC buys formats and sends out programs that would obviously be part of any of the most controversial channel software," Johnson told the Parliamentary Communications Committee, which explained the future of the BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a broadcast, which I do not think is necessarily a good idea in the medium or long term, it should reduce its supply to at least projects that are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC will send The Voice to the best viewing time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If there is no other way, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I don't understand why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without support", Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastE Others another, although it has its own building.
Many channels would give the right hand for it.
I do not understand how this serves the service provision of the broadcaster.
This would not be a loss to BBC."
Johnson is a serial killer who was under the leadership of Channel 4 in 2004-2010. He believes that the BBC is targeting good audiences because he is working on ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to that of the same Sky boss Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003, that BBC sells the series like EastEnders.
According to Johnson, programs for the BBC Niche public are shown on the BBC4 channel, where viewers are most often not able to measure, but they are intended to do so. "BBC can say, while defending its hypocrisy, that the 4 billion-pound broadcasting charges have actually made special programmes that no one was watching."
"BBC is at times when no one will ever see it."
Concerning the broadcasts, Johnson said: "I will contact you to find another, in other words, an old-fashioned system that will benefit from the best possible benefits.
Everyone thinks that 150 quid is cheap, but that's a big sum, especially if BBC isn't watching."
David Elstein, director of the former Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also told us his own views on Tuesday, said that the BBC should exchange some of its missions "to learn, teach and entertain".
According to Elstein, there are hardly any teaching programmes in the current range of BBC – on television 1% and on radio 0.1%. He adds that BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and put its mission to a new belief: "Know, illuminate and entertain".
The issue of cooperation Elstein proposes that the BBC could increase broadcasts, for example, from events such as the Proms Festival, which will be broadcast last year only a fraction of the concerts. "The BBC should also be involved in allies with commercial channels to ensure that the entire offer is also available online", he goes on.
Cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonnetetics.
The video shows how the diaphragm changes in direction when they are exposed to an absconding.
Researchers have gone beyond those whose system has been genetically modified, so that the worms can be controlled at a sound level.
The small diaphragms are changing their direction when they are exposed to an ultrasound with a frequency above the human earpiece.
The sound waves are triggered by motion nerve cells, which have been genetically modified in such a way that they have a medium that is shifting into a stream.
On the subject: Researchers will follow the brain’s activeness with a view to vision.
According to the researchers, the worms were able to demonstrate the power of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonnetics). The method of using the brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body with the next pension.
Researcher Sreekanth Calasani of the Salk Institute in Sydney, La Jolla, told Guardian that one day, DBS could be replaced by brain resuscitation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, in which the brain is stimulated by electric pulses.
Calasani observed that the worms, however, are beginning to react when they are put into a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
According to the Calasan, the bubbles are amplifying the waves that are moving into the worms.
The strong waves affect the TRP4 ion channels, which are part of the cells of the worms.
According to an article published in Nature Communications, these ion channels allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the wholesale ponds, Calasan genetically altered the worms so that I could control their movements from the points of view of the system, the TRP4 was released as a powerful one.
When the modified worms were channelled into the lightning, the microwaves reinforced the sound waves and moved to the worms, when the signal went off in the cell.
The method of developing a little optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool to enable researchers to activate cells with the help of light.
However, according to Calas, sonogenetics have certain aspects of optogenetics.
The light is directed towards the brain under investigation by means of photofibres, but low-frequency flashes can easily pass through the cell, so that the sound can be channelled to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that, with the help of treatment and virus management, human cells can be temporarily exposed to short-range signals in a local environment for certain neurological treatments," Calasan said.
According to the investigator, methods can also be used in cells and in cells that produce insulin.

There are also posters that require another look on the decks and on the locomotives.
"An important announcement: are you moving at speeds of 15th to 189th?" The notification reminds you of the appearance of the London metro announcements. At the other side of the metro line there is a picture of the tanker on the other side of the subway.
"In January, a number of arms dealers will be arriving in Dockland. Customers will be assisted in order to restore their posts."
Three hundred posters were made by artists who were presented at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collection of posters called Special Patrol Group helps to distribute posters around London, worth six pounds, with a six-knob box of advertising space hacking, which seems to have access to the advertising posters of around the world bus stops.

According to the curator of the Cruel Designs and the lecturer of the University of Essex, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question matters and to try to bring their work to the public to see outside the gallery.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires art to bring art into the real world. Many are moving on to working with the activists of the protest movement.

Amnesty's video has been viewed through the 28st over a period of more than 100,000 days, it has to be processed without remuneration by VCCP, and it has both been designed and repeated to work without compensation.
Matt Lever, the artistic director of VCCP, met with the absence and empty point of the ex-CeL event calendar. He said, "Let's start a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They wanted to make a more realistic, shady attempt, but bright colors and animation will make you feel better."
"They have done a great job and have helped us to highlight the fairs where illegal torture trades are being made," says Amnesty Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that torture equipment is not trafficked illegally at our home door."
However, the most creative feature of the arms fairs is present in the exhibition premises in ExCeL, where the set-up promotes excellent translations of their goods.
In his publication, Saab announced an order made by the United States of America concerning the "appealable AT4CS RS".

However, many dormitories consist of a social culture, where people walk from room to room and create life-long conditions.
the culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this regard, it is not possible to say: "I like you and I want to try to keep trying, but I want you to leave so that I can download back what I used to date you."
Find out if any of your fellow students are exhausted from coming to visit. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking, knocking.
In my own college apartment, there was a guy who, in the opinion of him, meant that he was welcome in.
All kinds of things.
Have fun with the bread.
You will learn correctly when it comes to baking, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a '50s, a little bit like, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I'll bake you something small. Smile when I tell you the correct details."
Home-made petals are the best way to get new ones.
Your partner has to talk to you. A pleasant surprise can leave us with a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable pasta.
If you serve an accident of flour, sugar and fat-sucking chefs, the others will probably pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Dipping food is also common in student housing.
Taking one chicken is, of course, stealing, but can your tea be poured out of another can?
Always make sure that the two cans are from the other side.
You'll probably get a permit, even though I can borrow your milk from the owner of your jar.
I know it's annoying if someone's got something on your mind. Still try to handle it as often as possible – unlike my own college partner, who threw his milk powder at the shoplifters.
She's in bed now.
Don't make noise when others try to sleep or to sleep.
Not only because it's polite, but also because it's worth remembering that everyone needs a bite...
In my own dormitory, one of the girls went to the next room to give music a little bit lower than the tune, because there were three in the morning, and there was a test on it.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I was still quiet in the bedroom, she let me sleep for two hours. She went for three hours on the road, left the music to open her room and locked the door.
Would it be romantic if your next spouse happened to move to another home?
And wouldn't it be weird if you first thought that your study partner was coming with you, started dating, getting divorced and having to see him every day and lose the right to meet me?
Of course, the heart wants what it wants. If the student's not exactly the right one, try to see what he wants.
If you notice, for a moment, that someone has forgotten their keys to a room where the door has not been locked, the limit of toy and bullying is more shattering than that of the rest of the world.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.
While hiding an object may be a valuable and true truth, it is not necessary to mess up a room with a vesicle and a sampoolla.
The door of the second room can lock and drop the keys to the glass of water that you put in the freezer, but do not attach anything to the roof with a blue sticker at any time.
Racist attack on a foreign student's residence in Kite - The reception centre planned to host the house was built in Salo.
A racist attack at Kite in North Karelia took place at the residence of foreign students last night.
On the contrary, this is not about detention facilities for minors, but about the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have already been in Finland, Kiten evangelical professor Heidi Luukainen says.
The windows and walls of the asylum facilities of the university were built with racist signs, such as the Hakarists, and a metal object was thrown through one of the accommodation windows, says East Finland.
According to Lukäinen, a youth education teacher in the university, who was under the authority of the state, there were about ten people in the building under the authority of an evil influence.
"Being and adults, people are free to move, so some may be elsewhere," says Lukkainen.
The university has accommodation in people from 12 different languages.
They have already been a recent student in Finland and newly arrived underage asylum seekers.
There are a-states for people who are in a mess-up building.
Some of them study in basic education, some of them are in public studies and some of them study in Finnish," says Lukkainen.
A status is a so-called second residence permit which can be granted four times to a foreigner who has already been present in Finland.
Eastern Finland is investigating an attack as an injury and a domestic violation.
According to Mrs. Lukka, an event was held on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's nothing in here, and nobody's leaving.
We have been studying abroad for the second time year, and this is the first time that something like this happens," says the Numerous.
According to Lukukukla, the mess has gone from the wall to the wall.
At least three men are suspected of being the authors and they were moving in a light passenger car.
I think this is the night's night's head, when this subject has now been on the table.
Nothing more serious," says Lukkainen.
Salo has also been founded in a hospital designed for the reception centre.
This happened the last time.
He told me about it on his MTV website on Tuesday night.
The hospital was marked by a brancher and written in English by "You are not welcome".
The case has been reported to the police.
5 p.m. at 1.02 p.m., corrected for incorrect information given by the police about the age and status of the people living in the house.
State resides in the Y-train to the Karelia - the passengers are not in the mood, "from an idiotic state".
The Y-train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karja will cease to die in March.
The news pissed off passengers entering the start of a flight at the main train station in Helsinki.
In particular, the downfall strikes the Siunti, said Torbjörn Bengtström, the municipality of Torbjörn.
It's an idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and working fast and I'm in touch with Helsinki.
This can be nothing more than a political will or a lack of it.
Bengtström says with the HTV interview notice that he'll be coming by tractor to the capital.
There are also fire changes in the rest of the U.S.A.
The H- and R-trains on the main runway shall be connected to a new R-line.
The station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusula remain out of operation.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry will purchase transport for the following period of the contract.
The day changes over the year and the routes to be closed are all over the country.
The next four-year agreement in autumn was adopted later by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Sijun Bengtström believes that the State transiter is an unlikely activity.
Every single error that has been made and repeated in a very systematic manner.
There'll be a penance.
Y-trains are also used by others other than raaseporians and guerrillas, because it is the best and bypasses multiple stations.
In Spain, Annina Laury was at home with the fate of those who travel the most to the city.
"It is a pity to those who re-enter their global journey," he says in pain on the Y-train.
The simplification of the home is permitted.
There must be a new station on the coastline that will replace the Y-train in the region of the Helsinki Region (HL), i.e. to take it to the church.
This will lead to more costs for HSL, in fact, for local authorities and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to examine the different options and their impact on service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi.
Costs are still impossible to assess accurately.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of points, HSL has paid for the Y-train for about a decade, of course, the Ministry has much more than that.
On the main track, the R-line is between two positions.
On the other hand, the number of tours in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
The whole country will have a total of 28 small locations and numerous routes.
The Ministry no longer buys bulk transport on the route from Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyvälä-Haapamaki-Seinajoki.
Piksämäki-Joensy route to the shortest route to Piksämäki-Varkas.
Trains on the routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
More than half a million miles per year, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The agreement is intended to provide the State with 12.3. annual savings.
The value of this value is approximately 2 million per year.
Sixten Korkman in the chapter of Capital Date: "Max needs to get to know you".
The crises in the world economy have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work in 1867-1894 on Capital, in the book Marx's Time of Capital, published today by Yrjö Hakanen, the first President of the Council of Europe.
"This is more serious than a long time ago," Hakanen wrote in his first speech.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and invading have proved to be extremely far-reaching in most areas of life, concentration of capital, and the growing role of money and imaginary capital.
The book list of books based on the Capital Seminars that started to be organized also includes the Professor of the University of Aalto, the prestigious economist, Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's present present "now and forever".
However, the former Chief Executive Officer of the Department of Economics and the Delegation of the Department of Economics is not a Marx, is he?
That's it.
Korkman on the phone says that he does not consider Marx to be a modern economicist, but rather as an interesting social thinker.
Today, social affairs are different and different, but Marx was a philosopher, a historian, a sociologist, an economist, a journalist, an agitator and a literary translator.
"General idea is that the aaartistry speaks of the wrong opinions of the dead," Korkman begins.
True, Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
In fact, Marx understood the nature and meaning of the British Revolution, he drew too far conclusions from the beginning of the capitalism, Korkman's mind.
However, the egman sees the value of Marx's radical attitude.
"The most relevant thing about Marx is that he asked some questions," he says.
We are now discussing Marx's interests again, such as the distribution of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who understand the big picture, as a result of the technical upheaval, to change the world", Korkman does.
Well, what we're supposed to decide is not going to help Marx.
I think that, as far as I'm concerned, capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Marx supports Korkman's experience.
"In the '70s, Marxa couldn't read," says Korkman.
"The peasants and the Trotskys and other sects hated all understandings, but even more so."
Today, the debate is more frequent, and Marxa can also approach the ideology of the years back without any pressure.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's mind - as in other classes," says Korkman.
Forced on a criminal in Sri Lanka for a criminal offence.
Calls for a special court to be set up to investigate the national crimes committed in Sri Lanka's civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on the civil war in 1983-2009 occurred on Wednesday after a delay.
The report is responsible for national crimes both by the Sri Lankan armed forces and by the rebels known as Tamils.
At least 100,000 people have been killed in the Srila Civil War.
There is no accurate information on the number of victims either.
In particular, in the last six months of 2009, a major attack by the armed forces should be announced, as required in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report charges torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be victims of as much as women.
According to the report, men and women have been involved in fighting side-by-side and child-to-side violence.
Both parties have committed murders according to the report.
Sri Lanka again on Wednesday that it will organise the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In the Thanh-Test, there was a tantrum of social media.
On Wednesday night, the syllabus of autumn had a long foreign language, which most of them had English.
More than 16,000 people have their own skills tested.
In the experiment, it was written about the matter as a matter of media.
On their own grounds, they should be thinking about the work of the social community and about being alone and working together.
In English, 150-250 was written to the administrator of the web site.
The Monday was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the resting chair of Finnish Leelia.
He came to me for advice on how to do things, too.
All the subjects were four of which one had to be selected.
"That was the hardest of them", considers the third topic of Porvoo's English English lecturer Mia Lybeck.
At this point, there was only a link from another President of the European Commission, Jose Barroso.
The point was that Lybeck had a nice time.
There was a conversation about why young people should be hired to work for young people.
"At least in our work, we have been trained to write speeches," says Lybeck, and evaluates the whole test "to make it easy".
In fact - or more often - some of the English experiments were responsible for some of the texts that, for example, included the adaptation of the summer horticulture to climate change and the handling of large data masses.
On Wednesday, there was also some long Russian (1st student), German (124), Polish (5) and Japanese (27).
The articles of the autumn are repeated on a frequent basis, in which the second domestic living or Finnish experiment is in turn.
The upper secondary schools are usually tested, i.e. the expression of employees does not affect it.
The University of Applied Sciences Board invites the pilots to search for appropriate contacts in time to get them to the trial.
if the delay was not due to your own negligence, you may be able to receive a period of time.
In the apples, a trade was made with a gun at risk.
In Ou, Wednesday morning, a trade was held in the city of the clock.
According to him, the shooter had gone into dark things and face-to-face a cover-up commandopo.
The man is normal and is about 30 years old.
According to everyone, the man had attacked the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
The case is being investigated by an ugly listener.
There are tens of thousands of protesters who are forced to come to Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland.
The manifestation against the government's replications will be blocked in the middle of the day, declare it.
Up to tens of thousands of people may arrive on the spot as soon as possible.
The members of the SAK, Aava and the STK alliances will meet at the Railway Market at 11 a.m.
I also believe that there is an inclusive spirit of mind.
On the other hand, the police at work are not only to deal with alerts and other police activities, but also to ensure that the mental manifestation is resolved.
Roads to the railway station are known from motor vehicles for the period between 9.30 and 14 a.m.
All we need to do is call in the area the alarms.
The traffic from the direction of Hakaniemi will be transferred to the Kaisaniemi traffic area, from the west to the mainland coast.
Is it enough for the police department to have people, Captain Seppi Kujala?
For the time being, it seems to me that that is enough.
I do not support the work-related issues of the police.
According to Kujala, support teams from other parts of Finland are coming from other parts of the world for the sake of their sense of mind.
There's no telling what the exact code is.
"Some of them are coming, but most of all we're going to go on our own," Kujala says.
We urge you to require private car rides in the morning of Helsinki.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic connection extends from the level of Hakaniemi to the core.
There's a lot of traffic going on between noon and the beginning of the day.
There are also many subscription buses coming from Finland with the help of protesters from elsewhere.
They will not let the Railway Entrepreneurial.
The busses are going to be a long way from here.
The journey will then have to walk to the location of the protest," says Kujala.
The demonstration also stops Helsinki's public transport.
From the point of view, there is also a positive side here.
The problem of mass transport, which is usually on hand at these big meetings, will now be dealt with as a matter of course.
The protesters have informed the police that tens of thousands of general economic policy opponents may come to Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the mood to feel calm.
There are few ordinary working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
The Finnish people are rational and peaceful," Kujala knows.
In many parts of Finland, Finland is also accompanied by local manifestations.
Friday's expression is in many ways an ordinary - do you remember these strikes and expressions?
One of the major protests organised by trade unions is in many ways interesting and informal.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Professor of Sociology at the University of Jyväskylä, emeritus Martti Siiseinen.
As a matter of fact, it is no wonder that ay-move protests.
If that's not the case, it would raise its hands in front of the government, said Sisinen.
The real estate government has introduced Finnish corporateism into the fundamentals of tradition - as well as those that are important for the development of the Finnish state of affairs.
The government's strong record is missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features in this, that ay-move is really going to get down on their knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the ay movement is not supported by all employees in some protests.
The novelty is now the sharp division that is created by the demonstration of the part that the ay-move would like to participate in the demonstration.
Throughout Finland, unemployed people who were gathered in Finland showed their senses in the Parliamentary House in August 1993.
If one of the statements is looking for a comparison, it could be the main impression of the unemployed, Mururstai, held in 1993, Siisinen says.
In the middle of the deepest depression, the Muruturstai collected 20,000 unemployed together.
Esko Aho (medium) was collapsing from one labour market to another.
It was said that the relationship between the Finnish Government and the trade unions was never as bad as in Aho's courtship.
The relationship between the state and the ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murjorstin.
Now there's no such thing as a police government, it says.
In this way, it is still interesting to see that it is so close to the right in spite of the basic Finns' speeches.
The elements of the new labour movement were the elements of the old labour movement at the time of the fresh start.
A number of new protesters are expected to be present.
Mind-telling also stops public transport and possibly covers days and schools.
Even if the protest does not receive undivided support from employees, it may become a matter of years.
In Helsinki, there have been about 300 distributions per year in recent years.
They're from the side to the side.
Traditionally, the protests of the Finnish movement have been very calm - even though the methods of action have become tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids the loop, is illegal.
Thoughtmakers try to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sisian.
At the end of the 1990s, however, new winds came into existence.
The mind culture changed.
EU membership got farmers nervous about throwing eggs and the police got ready to get their pig shit on.
The salary of the Presidents lasted three months in 1998 for a period of three months.
There were also visible strikers and pilots, among other things.
What are these strikes and demonstrations?
In the 1970s, metal and electricity houses.
The most important houses in the 1970s were metal strike in 1919 and power and power strike in 1977.
70,000 metalmen participated in the home of the mechanics.
The strike was concluded on the basis of a meeting of the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
The mechanics received a 16% raise in wages.
In spring 1977 the home strike lasted 49 days and broke down all over the country.
The break-in occurred in March of the year.
On 4 November 1999, some 20,000 people, many of whom were made unemployed by the recession, met with a view to supporting the work of the House of Parliament.
In 1998, three months of the firefighters were strikers in 1998.
The strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, except the longest in the world.
The farmer opposes the EU in 1994 and 1999.
In 1994, when farmers protested against the EU, they came into egg rain.
"Sibera teaches, the EU says," said one of the slogans.
The farmers were able to catch snow by the way of the day.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and banishment in front of the meeting site.
Nurses were strikers in 19th and 1995.
In that month, nurses gave up during the month.
The first time they were in existence was in 19 January.
A number of deaths occurred during the strike during the strike in 1995.
He threatened to do so in the years 2007 and 2007 and the number of managers in the field.
The threat of incarnation led to the conclusion of negotiations.
The officials strike in 2001.
"Doctors on the lattice - forced," read the slogan of the strike by the strike physicians who were on the lattice.
It took five months for municipal health centre and hospital doctors to complete a lively discussion on how to endanger public security.
After the strike, the general government raised the doctor's wages.
Workers moving in 2013
About 5,000 marches for study in Helsinki from the Secretary-General to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The central police are investigating the backgrounds of the Finnish lorry on refugees to find out what is going on.
police have been asked by the central crime police to assist in the management of backgrounds on a refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the police stopped a truck near the German border in the Afghanistan, with 42 refugees on board.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
You were all right when you were on the cold truck. You were all right.
We've had an exchange of information with the police.
Investigation and main responsibility are at the scene of the incident in Austria, reports Central Criminal Police Chief Inspector Tero Haapala.
At the end of August, the number of refugees travelling by truck in Austria increased by more fatally at the end of the journey.
At that point, all 71 people on board were apparently suffocated by suffocation.
According to the first-in-command Radio on cooperation with the police, the truck belongs to a Finnish stock company.
Among other things, it is a foreign-based man, about 40 years old, who is responsible for the activities of the restaurant and its management.
In the Republic of Austria, two Iraqi societies have been arrested for trafficking in human beings.
The Captain who beats the refugees, but a former trafficker and a clever businessman - the story of the five smugglers - the story of the five smugglers.
The king of up-to-date smugglers, the violent boat driver, the elegant missionary and the good-bye taxi driver.
For example, people live in the European Union because of the smuggling of human beings.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, who works at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and invited dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and the book Death Travel Agency will be meeting in Finnish this time.
In the course of the book, they are working on the smuggling of human beings, making proposals for decisions and targeting smugglers from different roads.
hs five of us.
I'm just gonna get rid of myself.
Kerkenna Islands The eastern coast of Tunisia is not attracted to foreign tourists, but many Tutian people are heading for summer hunting there.
On behalf of their islands, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, since the distance to the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 120 km.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the vicinity of El Attaya, there is Emir, a chained catcher and the father of four children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more productive to deliver people.
Emir has done it on a ten-metre wooden rod hundreds of times already.
If the boat is full, it will cost 40 people.
One trip Emir makes after spending about 8 000 euros.
Emi has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Things arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring period, the vast number of people wanted to escape from restlessness.
Then the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis reappeared.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerknna island in small groups.
Emi will accommodate them in empty houses for as long as it takes to see them.
What we're saying is that the client just and just survives.
Accommodation costs about 75 bucks a night, and if the customer runs out of money in the meantime, that's their problem.
We're going to go to the water in the middle of the night and lay low.
Let's drive off the island, then let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Sometimes the sea is heavy, and in waves 20 metres high, passengers cry and throw up.
At the end of the human cargo has been released in half an hour and Eman has returned.
She doesn't want to be afraid of her.
That's why he beats his clients and at least claims to beat the hangers to death.
In this book, he tells us that once the police saw him, he threw all his passengers over the edge and let them swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers from one neck and threw them over the top," Emir says in the book.
General passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
In his country, he is said to have to condemn this from here.
I'm just gonna go ahead and think about it.
They need to be shown immediately, here's the order.
A regular taxi driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bočšaša, Finland.
His taxi isn't very good - the starter engine's been pulling on him lately, and anyway, it's seen the best in the day.
The most important thing for Goran's customers, however, is that the taxi is moving at all and that it moves towards the border with Hungary.
Boča is a small village of a native about 60 km from Belgrade to lunch.
The village is located next to the center for asylum seekers, where the main places to stay are located.
In the central forests of the world, men without their families are staying in tents, lakes and abandoned cars, which they have now succeeded in finding or creating.
Also living in the forest are those who have not lodged an asylum application in Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private homes, but it's a secret.
Goran of the forest group finds most of his customers.
These are often the end of the exhausted - through the Balkans - the route requires a large number of crossings and day trips in the outbacks, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
In the near future, in the Bočeša region, in the hub of large smuggling of human beings, people are tired of dying.
Goran's guests are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurdishs.
The best customers are Syrians, he explains in the book.
"They say the right thing and that's it," Goran cheers.
According to him, the Africans are trying to make noises.
Goran doesn't.
A fool's hand all over the place.
First of all, let's agree on an example of 300 euros, then they'll lower it to 200 and now offer it to 150.
Goran emphasizes being a nice and good-hearted man.
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells his work more than the rest of us and billing for a ride to the country border for only EUR 50 per person.
The distance is about three hundred miles, most of which is just the freeway.
Colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran owes approximately EUR 50,000 per year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite an annual income.
Serbia has determined that taxis should not carry immigrants 12 miles closer to the border with Hungary.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the shortcutes and takes his visitors a mile from the border.
Then he points to the right direction at all times, and he's going to vehemently vehemently vehemently vehemently vehemently vehemently vehement
At work of grace, work of grace.
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called a missionary, and that is not just a nickname.
He really does have a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Kampala, where there are many believers who have fled the Congo, as well as a center in which children from Congo are helped.
In addition to preaching, the missionary tells us about the smuggling business where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of loving - kindness.
It's important to look good when you're around.
He polishes his shoes several times, and makes sure that the rubber of the white underpants is stunned in style from under the top of the jeans.
The publisher is thrilled by his new Mercedes, his new highway car and his three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and to the world forward.
The customer will first call one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary.
He advises that you should arrive at the border at once, hide the money in a way that you visit and go to the border with traders who cross the border.
In order to obtain asylum seekers or refugee status in Uganda, the authorities need to tell them that they come from, for example, the North Kivi military areas, and that they have been subjected to violence from their homes.
Often it is true, but if not, the missionary will arrange a new present for the customer.
The old identity card will be lost and another replaced.
That's where the missionary's contacts with Ugandan police are located.
This will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, at least the United Nations Refugee Organisation (UNHCR).
The preacher knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a refugee.
It costs about 100 euros to apply to the Ugandan police, approximately 150 to the humanitarian organisation, and between 4 500 and 7 000 to every European country.
Foliot and ice-cold zones
He's an instigating smuggler, but he's a trafficker.
Four Irish officers are on the French coast of Calais, where their job is to keep people on their way to the United Kingdom.
He's got an Afghan, a Russian taxi driver and a bunch of truck drivers in London who don't really know who they are.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near Calais center.
They drive the A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the freeway, Tom and the driver would go to prison for the organisation of immigration.
Of course he doesn't. He's already been sitting there for drugs.
The taxi will decide, Tom runs over the motors of his customers to a resting place where the drivers sleep before they cross the canal to the British.
Tome's choice of the right truck - is to make sure that it's working just now, not just in the Netherlands, but also in the Netherlands - and play through the safety guard.
It has to be done quietly so that you don't get out of bed.
One driver is on the run, but then the driver will be more expensive.
Once the route is clear, Tom is spinning around the foil, the same as the one behind which he wraps around the fryer or the oven potato.
It should prevent the police from detecting a hideout.

Muammer Küzyk is one of the world's most famous smugglers of human beings.
The most up-to-date Turkish law has been called the market leader and the dispute over illegal incursion in the Mediterranean, which manages maritime routes from Turkey to the EU countries, mainly in Finland and Italy.
Fük has been operating since the 1990s and has constantly developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a single competitive advantage for entrepreneurs: he's still asking for the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury discount: Turkish ports are rented for pleasure, as you wish to take the United States or European families to comfortable tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are loaded to a full extent by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transporting between 5 000 and 7 000 euros against charges first from Istanbul to one hundred and from there to Europe at sea.
They are kept in human life, for example in the old industrial halls, until these are time to leave.
Going into minibuses and driving somewhere along the coast.
It is worth hiding in the mind of the environment and waiting to see.
When it is given, the ship must be boarded as soon as possible.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The guard can only observe how far the ship is swimming, as no other group of people is present.
Food and drink are given, but the less people out and throw up, the better.
The hotel will receive approximately EUR 53,000 from one luxury ship after expenses.
He does not deal with things in the general sense himself but tends to deal with the heads, the recruiters, the guards, the hosters and other minor factors for his work.
During the summer, transport is provided by at least hundreds of people and the country makes millions of dollars.
He's supposed to have bought coverts across the country, a pharmaceutical company and over a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küyuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party congressman and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
He's probably disappeared since then.
Correction 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The book of Death Travellers will be published at this time, not next week.
A American Olympic runner tells in his book about his illness and becoming a prostitute.
Three times in the Olympics, a 1 500-metre runner Suzy Favor Hamilton's new book has been published in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells of his career ending and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine released copies of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton has decided to make his career at the Summer Olympics in Zimbabwe.
He came to the race in top condition and ran for the best time he could.
In the final, however, he found himself all over the place.
He rushed right at the top and defended his position on the ground with a run.
150 meters before the goal, however, his power was lost.
He collapsed to the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed by him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I would never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton, in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton had a two-way mood disorder.
His brother Don had done a year before Sydney's cats were killed, and he himself felt enormous successes.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The church had no economy, but she was fascinated by the idea of getting money for having sex with strangers.
He also went overboard with his husband to accept his actions.
Favor Hamilton's taxi was EUR an hour.
He says he's spent money on luxury life.
The one explanation by Mr Hamilton for becoming prostitutes was also that he longed for the same adrenaline loops as he had received in public sport in general.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had a two-way mood disorder.
The life of a former star runner came to light at the end of 2012, when the article was published in the Smoking Gun magazine.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres in the world's statistics at the time of 3.57.40, but remained for the last time in the Sydney Olympics.
The third world was thrilled when the Union imposed Norwegian skiing rules on it: "Indirectly clear".
The Polish ski king Petter Northug has crossed the boundaries of the same line at least one of its members.
The ski union in North and Norway has been working all summer and last year's sportsmanship.
It has offered the University a better deal than other athletes, and it has not been good enough for the multi-world and the Olympics either.
The result of this dispute was the decision of the Norwegian Ski Union to exclude Northug from the world cup of the next world.
The first was to thank the two world astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was afraid that the Federation had made a ski move.
"Thank you for your support," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the universe," he continued.
The dispute between the ski trade and Northug is about money.
Turns out, he's probably part of a whole new country team so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was pleased to represent a union that also cares for future generations, and does not allow one athlete to be a soloist.
He also recalled that the Union has given both the economic and the other privileges of the Union over the years.
I know that because I have been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a very different rule than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, the Highut published a personal record in which he assured himself that he wanted to play sports in Norway's colour next year's world Cup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympic Games.
Astrad Jacobsen won a total of three MMs in his career, two of which are gold.
He was involved in the team that won the relay last winter in Falun.
It is also held in the Nordic countries on a regular basis.
On the 25th of September, there will be a quake of various restaurants and shops that have been issued with a paper-transmitter shield.
The aim of this day is to highlight Finland's high level of food competence and low level of food leaving the restaurant and to raise awareness of the significance of the plate as part of a high quality.
It is worth recalling that not all high-level products are concentrated in the capital region, but all over Finland search for top restaurants that are controlled and classified by an independent operator.
The first focus of the event is a demonstration of the importance of the event as part of enhancing the awareness of thyroid restaurants and the organisation.
In the northern part of the day, Vaasa restaurant will take place at the Foundation and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, Thursday is a restaurant in Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events taking place during the same day in different parts of the world.
It will continue to exist as the host country.
Kauboki: Kaubahawa office application to the Chancellor of Justice for the establishment of a reception centre in Kaubahawa.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre at the offices of the former Kaubava settlement, now owned by LSK In Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent existence in the region of the critical infrastructure of the crisiser, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, the Finnish Special Networks Association.
The Kaaoki newspaper reports that according to a private person, the investment of the reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interest in the area and airport of the same Airport of the airport, which is also not explained in the study when preparing the reception centre.
It was concluded that, for the last two years, negotiations on the organisation of the field of Kauhava and the outcome of any foreign operator have taken place.
This issue has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Nihiö (ps.) and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
A member of the staff to the Chancellor of Justice that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition to the reception office, but of the fact that it is planned to be the right place in the former Parliamentary Area.
The Board of Governors of the month-to-day discussed the reception centre next Monday.
Navigation: Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
Management means that immigrants and those here have the most important conditions, Niistö commented to journalists in the evening after meeting with the presidents of all Parliamentary parties in his office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the P.O., the concern about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He appreciates the fact that governments and opposition parties in Finland are able to work together in an intimate way.
In these times, when we face major challenges, we will face them.
It is clear that the situation in Syria, as well as actions in the region of the United States, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
The system is hopeful for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a far-reaching direction, namely that the United States and Moldova are able to do so, it will have an impact on Ukraine and the still tension in the Baltic Sea.
According to that, the NATO site was also discussed in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation at work.

Researcher: A big risk for a pig is a risk to the brain.
According to the report, communication requires multilingual channels, and the Prime Minister's television and mobile phones are one of the other channels.
In the future, a channel of this kind of speech is needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in Parliament.
It does not yet have to be assessed how often the repeating way of talking about television and mobile phones becomes.
According to the audience, speech is not always broadcast through the Yle channel in the future.
If other channels are reported to be a channel, then let's see.
Now we're going to use this channel, Sipilä said.
According to Finland's economic situation, it is so serious that it requires that the television and mobile communications be given to the public.
What we are talking about here is rather complicated and requires a longer explanation.
We ended up in this channel, Sipilä cleared it up.
The speech will be sent from 21.05.201 to 21.20 in both 1 and in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Far away from being able to take the most important risk.
Media Researcher hopes that Sipilä’s mobile phone will not talk more about moving around in general.
The aim of this initiative is to put the right of choice of public debate in the first place and to abstain from public debate on disputes? asked Anu Koivönen, Professor of Stockholm University.
I would like to recall the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soin's recent comment that he does not take over the media agenda and that he does not allow it to be defined.
In the name of the democratic debate and of the public, I hope that these matters do not relate to each other.
To understand that commercial media has become angry at Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field did not react.
Political policy-makers' communication is not a matter of knowledge in society.
It is the responsibility of the media to make a definite effort to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken into consideration.
According to Sipilä, the mobile phone is a major risk for Sipilä.
We should talk about bringing something new and important to the table so that the high expectations that we have spoken can be met.
Is there anything else we've heard out there today?
Or is he able to talk differently, in a different way, or was I different or something different?
He says that if there is only more of the same thing in the permit, you should wonder why such a great gesture and Yle gave it the same time.
All in all, in this context, if this is not the case, it is a matter of particular interest to others to talk about the matter as a matter of urgency and as a matter of urgency.
There is a danger that Yle will be stamped in the communication of politicians or the Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in the interest or general interest of Yle.
From back to back, a clever move.
What is also important in the forthcoming talk is what is most important for us not to say, the media researcher stresses.
The evening will look closely at what Sipilä is up to and what it is not, says Jyvälän computer research operator Heikki Kutti.
According to the moon, the television speech is clever from Siloi, so this is how you get to bring your own point of view without sounding.
This message will be made public without a journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference, where journalists can ask critical questions.
The wing bypasses the media and speaks to the public directly.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong with the talk because they do not ask specific questions.
According to the moon, it is very important how Sipilä plays on TV - the sweat is pouring, shaking hands.
He's like a Sipilian to the real character, which now tells the people what to do.
If you can do the right thing, it can work.
The situation is different from that where you know about something, because it's like you're talking to someone who's actually talking to them.
Waa (United States President Barack) Obama and partners regularly engage in such activities.
Very ordinary.
Policy researcher Erkka Railo considers the main speech to be really an option for the public.
The reason for this is not for decades that the Prime Speaks directly to the people.
A meaningful time is the right way to go," Railo says.
The D.A. believes that the Prime Minister's intention is to make the Finns mindless for the one on the table.
In addition, wage and salary organisations organise protests and strikes against government action.
The President of the Left Alliance, Mr. Paavo Arhinmäki, says that Sipila could speak on the state of the nation in Parliament as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would also bring the talk to light.
President of the S.D. Antti Rinne (sd.) once again announces that he will challenge the Sipilla dialogue.
There's no time for monologues now.
Soon six months after the elections.
You can't hide in the endlesss, Rinne can understand.
A boy who was 9 years old on a runaway has been found in Finland since the age of nine.
The record was in order at the moment of finding it.
THE kid's been hit and killed, the son's boss updated his Facebook page.
The Internal Finnish Police Department will also refer the matter to the Iltalehti magazine.
Went out to play at the top at four o’clock.
Later on, everyone was no longer able to reach me.
Thank you to all those who have been helped in searching for help.
Thank you for the ten contacts and insights you have made during this time.

The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wild:
Educated freelancer Makwan Amikhani published the video on Facebook, which appeals to young people with specific immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani spoke out against the street violence.
Amirhani, who has arrived in Finland with his family in Iran and at the age of five, has won both of his Thursdays in the most prestigious UFC series in the free game.
Myrikhani tells me that he has received a message asking for a look at a new account.
There have been videos downloaded, where young people fight with extreme hatred.
My man says he's disappointed in the wild.
In the 26-year-old, Mirkhan has more than 62 000 followers on the agenda.
Others kick on the ground, sit on the other side and look at no matter what these consequences are, what happens when you make these videos, what happens?
Harder to defend than ever before.
Some of the young people on video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Mr. Jarmo Heinos, the Commissioner of the police, he said that the media have been loaded by both immigrants and young people from Finland.
It is not that you fight on the street at all.
You are doing so many other immigrants' lives more often here in Finland, says the Labourer Amirkhaani.
My reason is that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed in Finland.
The number of individual cases has become quite gross.
A little bit longer, boys, to defend you again.
You should remember that you are still staying in the world and you will be quite the strangest guests here.
That's a little different from thanking you for being here, says Amikhani.
Something tells young people to remember close by.
If they ever go after a racist, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Now, why don't you guys think about it a couple times before you go out with them, guys?
My man says that violent action will make a contribution to racism.
You're the one who gets the idea of what I don't think I do.
You've got a pretty bad thing for each of you, and you're not going to make it any better, Amikhani decides.
SAK puts his position on the savings package - Thursday: the decision is taken on Monday.
Mr Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, is aware that on Monday, the consumer organisation will express its views on the alternative savings of the JRC.
Lauri Lyly's comment on the TSI's proposal is well-informed.
In the past Wednesday, the staff member’s staff member’s STK announced that it would present to the public its own proposal, whereby the 5% productivity gap required by Juha Sipilä (medium) would be reached.
The President of the Committee, Mr Sture Fjäder, believes that the proposed proposal is proposed by the Bureau, if the SK, the STS and the Plan are behind all the proposals.
However, it would require that the largest wage and salary body, SAK, to smooth its position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, President of Sak, commented in a vague way on this matter.
Mrs Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will be examining the matter on Monday.
According to Lyly, Sak is looking for solutions to "open the labour market door" and that, instead of coercion laws, active parties need to enter into agreements.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilän's proposal for a social agreement did not give the SAK any assurances that the agreement had been concluded.
She had previously negotiated a social deal when SAK refused to commit to a 5% productivity target.
Comment: A grand demonstration threatens to warm up - "It feels like it's a little funny to wood a fist."
It seems a little funny to wood your fist, if there's already a play paper in your pocket, written by Pekka Tiinanen.
The climate is changing from side to side in the wager camp.
Is there going to be a call for a voice or is there going to be a match for that?
On Monday, the SAK's allies broke out against the Holy Church government.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the most desperate ones as well.
OAJ, a trade union of teachers, threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
Tuesday, OAJ suggested that no school or day-care centres would be excluded.
On Wednesday, Mr. Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STC, appeared in agreement.
He found that he had kept in touch with the government and that he was preparing an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity increase as required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium).
President Sture Fjäder (Kok) rushed immediately to announce that his agreement paper has already been completed.
At first, there was no word from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is hard to agree when the meetings just on Monday told him to put the earth on the earth on the earth on the earth.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the issues and that SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order for the employees to have a joint proposal, the SAK should be inclined to accept 5% of the productivity target.
Nothing, of course, is that the Fireola ICT has relations with the public of Sipilä.
The right hand of the fire, the communicative director of the JRC, Jukka Inus, was previously a special assistant to the Central Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi.
It is true that the government's ay-knowledge has been over and over again.
It's a coincidence or not, but the fire came out of the world's stand-ups, whose face is taken by the A.K. Marko Region (sd).
It seems a little funny to be working on a punch if there's already a play paper in the pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Detailed information on Lynn's comment is available on this item.
The Prime Minister called Finland a bad idea: "It must not be repeated".
Russian President Sergei Narryshkin criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
In the view of the President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Narryshkin, the Russian President, Mr Sergei Naryshkin, is a better OSCE father than he is Finland.
At Ulan Batori, the capital of Gora, the International Assembly of the OSCE, in which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki Annual Assembly.
Finland did not allow the European Union to come to a meeting of politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to join the European Union - a matter which Mr President recalled the officials.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of democratic democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This must not be repeated, Mr. Narysh also stressed the news office according to Interfax.
Naryshkin's criticism was directed not only at Finland and the EU but also at the United States, where his presence had also been prevented.
The sanctions are humane from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
The Russian delegation went on to say a few things, so Naryshkin continued to thank Finland with praise and thanks him for "for the very very very good of the truth".
I'm sure the general public assembly will go smoothly and with the same result - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
I understand that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met at Ulan Batori with the leading Ilkka Kanervan (kok), which is already in the middle of the debate with the Delegation.
There's a hole in the real playoff: "The paints are tight".
Tapha and Loke are today in Hakamets with bulls while they're on fire on the second day of the day.
Janne Lahti expected that today in Hakamets he would see the real goal parties.
The police went to Kuopu to check out 3-2-and-a-time gain from Kalpa.
The rise was manic, for the silver group in the last month was at least two goals out of a position of success.
The count on Tuesday was a mollusc victory.
The Roman catch of the stars who had taken off in the bag was the same as the present point, and the loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, the paints are tight, if at all they play the same game as last year, Lock-a-buyer Janne Lahti is expecting to set up on the following pages.
Mipara has become a previous playoff nightmare for Raumas.
Tappara has been in the middle of the second period just since Luko's finals series.
A decisive seventh match has been required for both sides of the solution.
In the last second round, the Slug took one of the breakouts already in the fourth game, but at the top of the three next side and over.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups, except for the goalkeepers.
Both counter-responsible cassettes receive today's shift.

In 1976 Sylvester Stallone handwriting Rocky film, where he himself played the main part.

An anonymous and woody packer reached the SM finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymity, but tough underdogs, like Rocky.
It was the same Indian, Porin Matti and Pelto Pelto.

Semimi Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been mowing around in the middle of nowhere than Rocky's pig carcases on a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Fivetasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparinen are in something other than playing in the game.
Mr. Pekka Railwayllio has been asked to present the main part of Rocky VI.
Carri Kivi has crossed the Rautallion Sean Connery.
In Räätallio, in Rähla's handbook, Räys is as clumsy as Conner's main author as if he had been in the original of 1976.
There's nothing like a Rocky other than a nickname.
Rautalalio’s game philosophy does not include rowing and long-term learning.
It's a tough game, but it's a different thing to a tough game than a pig.
In the last month, the Ässien Gard Stafford hit the head of the Killer Jere Karelian.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judge, but Rautalalio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
They only use those who deserve to be used.
I don't accept such a game and it's not part of the show, the hot Ratakallio woke up after the game to the people of Satakunta after the game.
The recent team is definitely built.
There are pups, veterans, policemen and e-mails.
There is no real key to the best game age.
No doubt that the master coach has chosen a talent.
How much have you been able to influence your gamer procurement, Pekka Rautakallio?
The events of the next season took place in procurement and, in fact, the market was rather narrow, Rautallio was diplomatically replying.
Under the pi under the handle.

It really wouldn't have been worth writing the rest of the script.
Olga Temonen plays the mother of Pipe St. Santa Claus.
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband when she was a teenager, there would have been nothing in common.
Olga Temon plays for the first time under her husband's guidance.
Yes, I'm going to play my husband's friend's mother in the second.
In a way, it seems crazy, actor and author Olga Temonen.
She has been married to Mrs. Apulanna's ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temonen since 2008.
The couple have worked hard together before, but now Olga is for the first time acting under Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the first-year film "The Beautiful One of Us" by Sipe Santak's mother, Sirkka, is the drummer Sipe Santak.
Sirkka tsempata and support his son, even though his father Risto (who plays Lorenzo Backmann) is trying to make a sound of reason.
The more I have learned about the true pattern of Sirkka, the easier it feels to make the role of Sirkka.
He's the guy, and I'm trying to make sure he trusts me.
Olga had been the last Sirka before the film project, but since then, two people have gone a lot.
They've met, talked on the phone and texted.
The circus has really helped a lot.
We've been going through a lot of different angles in their history.
Fortunately, the circus also understands that the drama is a drama, and it may be necessary to colour a little bit.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Helpland would become the largest in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a depression and a real pain in the ass.
It's quite a small probability that someone will actually succeed, but Sirka had some kind of intuition, and she was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot about this youth before you made it.
However, the stories of parents have not been very different in the past.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, you know what you really know.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from that known as Heinola’s evil-pained scepter as the well-known Heinola Heinola Heinola Heinola.
Olga was an everyday girl, and she was a nice girl, and she wouldn't have had anything to do with the movie tutka.
At most, he could've kept a secret.
According to Olga, he has worked so hard with the pulak for 10 years that the joint project is not afraid.
Everything has always gone super well.
Now the whole production will be in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple living in the country are often going to drive home because of their young children, because the distance is not too long.
We're going to rule all of Heinola for a month.
They have truly welcomed us, only to ask what streets and when to waste.
Iron Sky 2 is Finland's most expensive drama film.
The budget for the Iron Sky: The Coming Race film is 17 million euros.
The recordings will begin in February in Belgium.
Director Voyurensola is starting to film the Iron Sky 2 film in February in Belgium.
Scifi film The Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, will be the most expensive feature of Finland's ever history in its 17 million-million-dollar budget.
In the past, Jalmari Helander's Big Gamelle has been the most expensive film title in Finland.
The current Angry Birds animation is also coming to an end after the completion of Iron Sky 2, because the film has a budget of more than EUR 100 million.
The screenings of the film directed by Voorensola and by Tero Farland begin in July at the premises of Aed Studios near Antwerp and last for three weeks.
Director Timo Võorensola is going to Belgium next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I'm totally out of my mind.
I mean, I'm thinking so relaxed with the file script, because I know exactly what movie to come from.
Everyone at work seems to realize that we should do something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Time is tight, there's no fear in your head.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the public, he'll tell the evening magazine.
The original film budget was set at 8-10 million, but it was also written in writing.
The budget is big, but there is a big scorer.
However, 100 people would be forced into the film, because each angle and effect are so narrow.
It's all been so fucked up that there's no find.
The film company Iron Sky The Universe launched a financing campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8% this Wednesday.
The final rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In no more than two years' time, the company will repay the loan.
The film features, for example, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or chalet?
Big sisters go back to their shirts.
In recent times, great logos have been embellished by the trends in the schedule series.
The last time a fashion-conscious learner avoided clear and large logos like Crocsja in the console.
The promotion of a hood or T-shirt was seen as some kind of skank.
I don't know what you're talking about.
The public has become the right fashion mega order, as well as the old, familiar sports fashioned roles, such as Adidas and Nike, have risen to the wave of heat.
And so often, at first, the bounds of fun and legend are fuzzy: if something is already right, it starts to turn into an irony and a clash.
At first, there was a normal score trend, i.e. a tavis fashion, in which the trend series would prefer as boring basic clothes as possible as a way of separating themselves from the mass.
Now we're going to stick on a grey base colle instead of a button on the back of the buried vertebrae, which faces the logo of the manufacturer.
The bigger and the better, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' identified track-liners, favorite team playing shirts and New York Yankee flags have made a return to the Union.
The Calvin Klein logos of the alkkars are now a cool detail, starting at the edge of the jeans.
Trade seems to be moving from the Sportmark to the luxury brands as well.
The Versace's side of the occult sounds makes it clear what kind of illustrative clothing is.
Would you be ready to work out your logos when you're getting ready?
The Russian politician found the evidence: I didn't get stuck in a gas station for hours!
It is claimed that there would have been a special incident in the Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, the producer of products from the US, was held 2015.
Over the past few days, there have been widespread colourful claims in Russia that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to separate the large Lots from the tank hatch for six hours.
Zotov has recently done everything he can to deny the information.
He was still on his own public web page, even on his own public web page, a picture where he seems to be looking at the door of the armored man in very good moods, and at least those images are not about being stuttered or angry.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't get involved in the tank, but it was the BMP-3.
I am a former soldier, Colonel, I am serving at the Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in private, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't take five hours in that position, he said.
For the Russian TV channel, Potov explained that he was fascinated by the new method in the opposition, as he himself was a former professional soldier.
I was worried about what was inside the shed, and I was fascinated by our way of doing it.
And I came out through the back door, he said.
In all tanks.
In the next vision, I intend to definitely visit all the tanks and all the RVs, Zotov promised.
Otov also called the reporter who made the call a fool of him.
I mean, everybody else did.
Nothing was ever there.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but there's nothing like being stuck in a tank, not happening, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photograph of the claim of wearout has been published, although in the arms trade for a few days the total number of 50,000 people has been released.
The argument that Zotov got drunk began at the beginning of the Bloknot.ru case, in which they told their hangers about the tanking and threatened to shoot everyone around, and he would not get out of the surface.
Later, the Bloknot site started a story in which the exhibition organisers told us about what happened to them.
Everyone is just used to the fact that they jump fast out of the armored pieces.
Mr. Zotov, a Member of the European Parliament, due to his large size, was simply stalling when he came out.
In no way did he sit there for five hours, said the exhibition's coordinator, Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of Agnico Eagle Finland, a foreign subsidiary of Canada.
The purified process water of the mines has leaked into the so-called enrichment sands of the bay.
According to each of them, the measures to correct the bleeding have been initiated.
The pool has a foaming process of neutralized enrichment sand and purified process water.
The water is either either re-usable or re-directed, as appropriate, through the coating box to the environment.
The year was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was found.
According to each of them, the quality of the leak water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
the substance was not released into the environment.
The leaks were found in the morning of Monday morning.
The leak has not been found to have caused structural damage to the pool of dams.
The author tells us about his close cooperation with the police to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent jobs.
Dansken Kuuppaaski: IMF to make sure you don't cut too much.
The Finnish Country Report, published today by the IMF IMF, largely reflects the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation pushed Finland’s leading structural reforms to overcome the economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime and paid vacancies would support Finland's existence.
Reforms would be necessary for the whole contract system and for the protection of employment.
According to Danske Bank's chief economist, Pasi Kuuppamäki, there are also differences between the structural reforms that are agreed, but there are also differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a comprehensive message for government action, but there is also a warning of what should not be cut.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuopamaki tells the House of Economics.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be carried out as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF expects a 0.4 per cent growth rate for Finland this year, which will accelerate to 0.9 per cent next year.
Danske is expecting today to see its new cyclical forecast of growth on the back of the year.
The IMF is a little optimistic from now on.
They may have had the basis for the latest findings.
In this morning, total output was recorded during the summer in a small economic activity, Kuoppamäki stated.
It is likely that less attention will be paid to the narrower dimensions or the so-called softer dimensions.
In some cases, however, there is only a few per cent of the decimal country.
The dying Nintendo appointed the new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, who had died in late July under Satube Iwata, was working on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was the most popular and charismatic event in the game.
For example, ita responded to the launch of a genuine Wii console.
Choosing a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimisma is a safe choice for Iwata's footprints, evaluation by Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task is to involve Nintendo in mobile games, so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
In Finland there is an increasing number of underage asylum seekers arriving in Finland.
The Swedish Immigration Service already recognised in February 2015 that hundreds of children who have entered the country will disappear every day.
This has been reported, among other things, by SZT.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of minors disappear annually.
Juha Kanselma, the Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains what is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is there the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants disappear in the "underland" year?- In Finland, in 2012, a total of 156 applications for asylum were made by a minor who was alone in 2012.
They're on the count of nine.
In 2014, the corresponding requests were sent to 196 and lost 11 people.
In the absence of a missing person, the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying for the Dublin Regulation may be that the applicant is already registered and may have been found to be of full age there.
The applicant may be more prone to disappear than to continue the matter in Finland and to be sent to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons are also included when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were submitted for annulment on the grounds that the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so that in the last 16 years, he says, there were no adult asylum seekers missing.
Amount in progress?
By 6 September of this year, a total of 576 applications for asylum for a minor have been submitted to us alone.
Statistics on the number of underage asylum seekers missing this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to also affect the number of missing persons, he stresses.
How did the decision change?
Is there any other way of saying "the dark labour market"?
This is a difficult matter to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for implementing the decisions, the Commission stresses.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Petter Orpo (kok) has been involved in the growing number of non-registered immigrants.
He has taken action on this matter.
During the EU Prime Minister's meeting on refugee issues, Mr Orpo spoke on Monday about the practical steps to be taken to manage asylum seekers through the stream of asylum to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen, who has lost his job in the media sector, is now on the market for TV and radio production.
Mikkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells on Huuvu.net equipment that had previously been the most advanced equipment in her field.
The first issue of the online announcement was the first web site in Italy.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind for economic development.
In the global media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer described.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be excitement.
Of course, the system is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these too, as long as there is currently modern material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and self-study architects, Nina Mikkonen inquired about IS.
The reason for this sale is that Mikkos is trying to move away from their present home in Stormsky.
There's no way we can bring all the goods with us.
I've just started to invent and see what stuff they're giving up.
I'm starting now, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for TV or radio equipment.
After recent myocardial infarction, it is clear that your career will not return to work again.
Ms. Mikkonen notes that now there is nothing but goods and equipment.
The actual life work of Timo T.A. Mikkonen was already carried out in the summer in the National Audiovisual Institute, which was visited by representatives to pick up films and other materials from Storms.
Transport is most threatened by a shift than expected: Metro and trams can move all over the place.
The drivers of the metro and tram today decide whether to extend their efforts to some protest.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram transport for only one of the moods that would take place.
During the day, it is decided whether to run the traffic all day.
Chief Commissioner Pekka Monkonen says that the pride is high on the field.
Night and shift doors are causing a terrible rise in drivers, so the government's plans to cut the lines are a source of opposition.
The monster wondered, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the metro and trams stand together, the traffic in the capital region is virtually completely in a state of stagnation.
According to VR data, the trains will not pass between 6 am and 6 am.
Friday, there will be no nearby and no long-distance traffic.
The stations that left the morning will be driven to destination stations.
According to HLL, most of the buses are left in the stables.

Repo says that HL is not able to do exactly what buses are going through.

The Muslim boy was held in a school in Pakistan, and the teacher made his own clock a bomb.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since his teacher held the home-made watch he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to explore the output of his electronic hobby.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock looked like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being taken to a juvenile detention cell in handcuffs.
Mohamed has not really been said to mean that he had made a watch.
Still, there is still a possibility that the boy would be accused of doing more lies.
According to Mohamed, the police had known that there had been a time when they looked like "the movie bomb".
The clock is in lock-up, but it was made up of a known circuit board and a digital display between which there was a lead.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamia was forced to go to school for three days.
His father is angry with the case and the American Council of the United States of America is asking if there is only one demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK Kohisee - Director of Labour asked him to sing a national song.
In song, God is worshiped to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the monarchy.
The Court's criticism of the press has also been accompanied by representatives of the Corbn's own Labour Party.
This is an insult to the public, reported by the Labour Representative, Kate Green, during the BBC radio interview.
I think that Corbyn should have gone to the song.
At yesterday's memorial event, the fight against Luftwaffe in 1940 was summed up by British Air Force fighters.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its opinion and urges him to pay tribute to the players by taking part in the event.
We're all in a huge debt of gratitude for the attack of the Royal Air Force Housekeepers.
He (Corbyn) stood up with respect during the National Song, and stated in the opinion.
Corbyn's election to the chairman has divided the laboratory lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will banish moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the end of the economy and public procurement.
For the first time today, Corbyn is scheduled to be present in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time for the first time.
Corby has asked the public about what David Cameron should be thinking about.
Cameron crawled at the weekend in knowledge of Corbyn's selection for the event.
Workers are under threat from our national security, economic security and the security of our families, Prime Minister of yours on your own account.
The reason for my family's death is still unclear - my father was waiting for a legal case.
South Lake Kusttonka police have been investigating the death of a family in Greenwood, Minnesota, shortly a week.
The five homes were found dead at home in 10 and a couple of months later, they found that the shooter was home Brian Scott Moving, 45.
After first taking his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Six killed the house in the garage.
Dead for years for days.
Find her after she was worried about the child's absence at school.
On the basis of this announcement, the police went to the house to visit, and they were living in different parts of the house.
According to StarTribu, it is possible that the victims were killed for days.
Quarterly and joint venture
The case of Michael Sitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Kistonka, is still under investigation.
The motive for blood actions is still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property at the social media site AllNurses.com, which was directed to nurses.
In 2014 StarTribune in the interview Short multiplied the site by four different prices per week.
I've been offered 50 bids for the last 10 years.
I've abandoned everything.
I still have a lot of ideas for what I want to do.
Perhaps at some point in the sale, but not yet.
Loss was seen, among other things, that in 2011 the family bought a crazy house in Greenwood for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the property site in Zillow for the calendar night of the car collector: there are not only 12 rooms in the house but also eight garages sufficient for the eight cars.
The case is pending.
However, according to Dr.Tribune, his father was waiting for a legal case.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered various pre-supping courses, had requested him to be entitled to receive his comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, no comments were removed from Short's site to discourage pre-publishing courses, and thus they had lost customers to their customers.
However, according to Mr. StarTribune, it is very unclear whether there would be any significant impact on the transaction.
Vesku Loiri offered coffee coffees.

In short, 150 million vehicles are connected to the network: the launch of attacks on the security of cars is now underway.
In addition, the Autonomous Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in the sector, as announced by Intel.
The municipality is composed of high-level safety experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out ongoing safety tests and actions aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel is the first of the best practices of cyber security in public.
In future, the report will be updated on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The National ICT research and consultancy company Gartner estimates that, by 2020, some 150 million vehicles in traffic have been connected to the network.
Bad things are better than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 per cent of the vehicles can consume, create and share network-based data.
We can and must improve the cyber security of cars," says Intel Security Director General Chris Young.
The ASRB allows Intel to establish best safety practices and to support the belief that cybersecurity is an essential component of the design of every network-connected engine.
Bad things are better than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB panel the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.

During the three-year break, the second singer who has become pregnant has lost their way with only one exercise and yoga.
Chisu's prospect will be completed in a year.
The singer discovered his first single in the new album in January.

The new life situation has inspired new things to be done.
Here, you're actually wondering if you're gonna find my new album, Chisu.
Kim Kardashian's mother is astonishing again - now she's looking at the front.
Realtv beauties Kim Kardashian give a talk after each other.
She was looking at her pregnancy stomach and her breast care freely in a sexual state, the last night at one o'clock when she left her sister's office with Kourtney Cardashian, a husband from Kanye West's gig.

He made his own documentary Peaking Dolls (Speaking Dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues speak their own mouths about clean business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine was sized by Leloup's heavy behind the scenes.
The season begins with nothing.
In the second period, you would have posed in the costumes of the top planners, a new period in the castings again.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for work with congruents.
The model obviously has a place to call home.

New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's not just the decency.
Agents in New York may ask for lost pounds, but then in Paris you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk.
Models and designers are always at the same time working as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is hazy.
The models want to be in this field because of the possibilities it offers, but let them know that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation.

This is a pretty tough problem for me, because I'm about to be a 26-year-old rapist, and in this movie I'm going to play a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen.
I've never wanted to see the real Antti before, because I want to make it my own story.
It's obvious that it's for people who don't know, so I think I'm good at learning what they're saying.
I don't want to do the math about human beings.
The man who pilots Rope Salminen and Dogs isn't going anywhere.
The punk-man turns come with the man in fact.
The stars, the stars, they sure saw the first taste, so if it's on us.
Our existence has never been anything small, but always complete.
During the year 1999-2004, the main performers of the film "You Make A Beautiful" were announced today at the Tuukka Temoen station.
The nuclear force known to the audience of Bandi is still relatively unknown to the general public by young actors.
The drummer Sipe Santa Claus is performed by Teppupu Manner, singer Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temo from Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen tipped me about the forthcoming plague last night, when he mysteriously told Snapchat that he was preparing for the most important day of his career.
Rope has already seen a picture of the new scene he's had to create for the film last night.
Roope, previously seen in the hair and jaw, has been ingly lynched and dyed with brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is what you tell your children about refugees.
A lot of people in the first few days have had to wonder how to tell the child about the situation of the refugees who are seeking a Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to speak on this point, Member of the SPR's crisis report, as a psychologist, Mr Ferdinand Garoff advises.
A minor child needs to be protected and, for example, should not be allowed to watch all of them alone.
The little ones are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the mind and bother, he does.
However, if the child has had a lot of news about the refugees or discussed the matter elsewhere, it is worth talking about.
It is good to discuss the child’s departures and to see exactly what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They are not necessarily the ones that the child imagines to be afraid of.
Lasta does not want to be afraid, if she does not worry and fear herself.
The older child closely follows the conduct of his parents.
If you stay calm during the conversation, the child will also feel alive.
The main ones are likely to have a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to have a talk with them if the child is concerned.
The fact is that people in the world are not good at things.
Parents and their children can think about how we can get along with this.
After all, is the world a safe place or a safe place?
Parents may also have different perspectives - perhaps they want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, when you talk about difficult things, you get an idea of how to deal with the truths that come to life.
This could be useful for the future.
The psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children more easily".
Own forces at the top?
Still, you can still be your child’s best shot.
The rain-emitting globe of Ballsalaland is hard to understand.
Pertt Pohjola was able to beat Apala's Ballsalama in the middle of the strike.
It only made profits and 2nd lines until at the end of June, in the peaks of Tampere, there was a breakdown.
Since she was in deep trouble, the coach suspected something wrong and ordered to be protected from time to time.
The explanation of how we left out was clear in the audience.
The horse had a laryngitis.
It was not the easiest way to get away, but it was the need for a two-year course of medicine to stop it.
Because the Apilan Palshallama may be in the mind of exercise, Ostrobothnia is sure to say that it is a surprise of the last run.
It was in Turku in record time after another SE-mama Taruntuple.
Apilan Pals Salama was on a break when it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
The little tendency of good things at the end was understandable, says the North.
The coach assumes that I'm going to open up competition for them.
The sound of the horse went from that to that, and it would also be abhorrent.
Apilan Pällsalama has been so-called humorous horses.
It's not fun, it's fat, even when it's sick.
On the other hand, today it has been so hard to say that the adversaries were in wonders.
In the run-by, there are no match-makers acting on the Balloon, which is very warm-blooded by visitors.
In the hopes of the Nordic Region, the Vermo has a farce run in its hive.
However, it is different how Aplan Palletalama agrees to it.
It's time to start at the time of departure and may even be at the bottom of the getaway and that's it.
I wish that the ori would be better than Market's.
Apilan Pällsalama is also in good condition, coming out of the bow, and we're going to drive it out of profit, coach's permission.
For this reason, you will not be able to get rid of the unnecessary iPhone programmes.
The operational management of the operation is Tim Cook.
At least some of the programmes that accompany Apple's iPhone phones may actually be deleted today - but not all of them.
Apple is likely to be able to remove some of its own programs from the iPhone phones, reports the company’s CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed magazine interview.
There are a number of programs on Apple's iPhone that are actually rarely used: for example, FaceTime talk, Magazine, Healthys, Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which was forced to use iPhone phones, although it is only necessary for Apple's smartphone owners.
According to Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complex than it seems on top of.
The applications have been linked to another icon.
If they are deleted, it may cause trouble somewhere on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfed.
Cook did not know which Apple iPhone applications work closely with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
At the same time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook your add.
So, according to Cook, Apple is investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste memory from the computer's iPhone phones.
The euro area GDP went down by 0.1% in August.
Consumer prices in the euro area fell only slightly during the period, i.e. by 1% of the year-on-year, EU Statistics Eurostat reported today.
The fall in prices was driven down by a low level of low energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a few more weeks ago the estimate of 0.2 years is slightly downwards.
In March, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called bottom inflation fell by 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
The estimate for the euro was 1,0.
Energy was 7.2 per cent lower in the euro area last month.
The total EU average of 28 countries was in the middle of August.
One per cent of the total loss came in the course of the past.
In the euro area, the highest, or 1.4 per cent, of consumer prices went up in Malta.
Per cent of GDP was lowest in the fall of 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, consumption was 0.2 per cent negative according to the EU's harmonised index.
Euro area GDP remains close to the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is two per cent likely to rise in the medium term.
The average GDP per capita of the euro area over the year is 0.1%.
Next year, the growth rate will be 1.1 per cent, and the central bank forecasted in its new forecast at the beginning of the first quarter of the year.
The United States is now trying to tighten up monetary policy.
The second recession will begin at least less than a year later, but probably within three years after the country's Fed is back on track for a long time.
And on the financial market, in turn, first of all, the first recession begins.
Fed has been suggesting that he will be starting the meetings this year and by the end of the year at the latest.
Thus, the next downturn can be triggered at least by the next time and in the financial market before that.
That is at least what happens if the world economy and the financial market act the way they have been - and if they deal with the tightening of Fed's finances as they have done before.
The main conclusions have been drawn by the German bank Deutsche Bank’s strategies in the London market for Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive long-term market and economic analysis.
The bank distributed over 60-person Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international major customers last year.
The methods drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed is going to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market afterwards.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of the economic statistics to determine how the economy and the market have previously evolved during and after Fed's weightings.
In addition to the critical criteria, they will look at what economic and financial market central variables are now in the same or similar way as in previous sales - and what might result from this.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial market are now in a much more economical state to bear the high level of expenditure than ever before in the 1950s.
At the beginning of the recession, it may not be a year.
The leaders of Fedi's finances and of its own mistakes have been suggesting over the past summer and the beginning of the autumn that the time is beginning to be ready to raise the exchange rate.
The first increase of more than nine years could come this month.
This will be resolved by Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised the so-called Fed funds control rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the ratio of two years to a regular but at one time a small 0,25 percentage points of the amount of interest charged by Fed increased its ratio from 1.25 % to 5.25 %.
The general financial market held in 2007 the difficulties of the United States' most risk-sensitive credit facility, and one year later, the financial crisis became a major cause of the crisis.
The main downsizing was in 2009.
The last time the serious financial and real-life developments were slower than ever since the loan purchases in Fed had been made.
Similarly, the trials were, after all, tougher and rougher than ever before in the 1930s depression.
The strategies of the European Union have been looking at the peaks and billings of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial market since and from the beginning of the 1800s onwards.
In the early 1950s, they will make clear the main points of interest and their economic and interaction with each other.
The beginning of the recession has been, at least, over a period of at least one year since the first drawdown, often less than two years and, most often, less than two and a half years after the start of the recession.
The rise in the financial market has ended within two years of the start of Fed's borrowings.
Fed has taken up and in turn calculated his guidance rate since the early 1950s by a dozen different dimensions.
Each time is different in some respects, and the times are considered relatively little, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the cost of the following charges.
They therefore point out that this time many things are different.
It's not better than that.
The interest rate too low is too long.
For the main reasons of the financial crisis, even those responsible, it is not necessarily necessary to find out without doubt even decades of research.
the fact of the crisis and of the reasons for its strength, it seems that there is no doubt that:
1) Fed, the ECB and other major central banks in the world held their help rates too low in the 21st century.
They were patching up the Teknokum mark, and they grew the next one.
2) The economic and real economy has accumulated over the years and is already too large in terms of the impact of excessive monetary policy in the global economy.
A major currency bubble was born in the back economics.
3) In particular, the financial crisis in the financial sector, particularly in the face of the financial crisis, increased to most financial market segments by the largest exchange rate bubbles from shares in real estate, bonds and assets in the current financial history.
It is hard to doubt that, in the face of more and more domestic shocks, the heights of the increased financial market were rarely dangerous and unstable, while Fed and others were driving upwards.
General government debt securities, at the same time as the valuation curves, did not last until the start of the period when the weightings had started and the cost of the lending had gone down.
As a result of the financial crisis, it was followed by a large recession.
Larger bubble and more
The strategies of the jun do not guess what happens next, but they provide the subject of suspicion, for example, with the following points:
(1) Fed and other major central banks have now held their monetary stance even further than before.
If they were too low in the past, they are now even longer still.
2) Debt has not long been mad as it was then, but now the money is literally cheaper than it is.
The economic and real economy debt has not been relieved, but now, in various parts of the economy, there is a much more severe financial burden than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) For the most part, the central bank's central bank's central bank foreign currency has remained on the financial market and has delayed certain types of securities and assets at or above the top of the financial crisis.
In addition, they point out that the economy has not yet recovered from the world of the economy and for decades from the most serious recession than has happened before.
The euro area economy has barely come to an end at all.
In fact, the real economy is in an unusually weak state, but most of all, the pressures and risks of the financial market are disproportionately greater than before the financial crisis, as Fed next starts to tighten up his finances.
The picture of the world of Albert Edwards's future of the former Societe Generale strategy is not as obvious as it may seem.
He has been training the bank's international investors in Fedi for some time now in the following translations:
First Fed raises interest rates, then the planets explode, and soon Fedin's time has come to run out of the budget for even more major QE seasons.
Computers and printing Hewlett-Packard (HP) is trying to generate up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions relate to HP's private service side, the company tells.
will be distributed in January to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which will focus on retail sales, and to HP Inc., which will focus on working pcs and outputs.
HP had the highest number of posts in 2011, with 30,000 employees.
Last October, staff had been reduced to 302000.
One-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (about EUR 2.4 billion) per item of the arrangement.
Hewlett Packard on the Enterprise is launching between 25,000 and 30,000 people.
Half the reductions will remain in 3300 over a period of two years.
HP is trying to transfer the investment to the HGD, so that 60% of its employees would be low costs in 2018.
It says that it has already balanced its business in such a way that none of its customers anymore account for more than 5% of its operating result.
In the second year, 65% of the operating result was generated by its three largest customers.

Yle: Minister Berner has been working in the general public of the Tax Goods Company.
Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berne (medium) has worked as a member of the tax union.
The company's activities involved so-called tax planning.
This is a Luxembourg-based Telli II LuxCo company, who was appointed as a member of the Berner in February 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner is still a member of the Board of Directors.
Mr. Berner himself says that he has submitted a resignation notice for his membership this late this year.
I checked it out, and that's all I've done is leave a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and verify that the registration chains are on schedule, says Berner in the Yle interview.
After the merger, the formation of the formation after the merger followed the formation of the merger.
The ownership of the Swedish company Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg branch.
Kähs is a carpentry manufacturer, who blended in with Finnish parking manufacturer Karlia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner worked in the Karélia-Upoflor government in the years 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs government and in the Luxembourg community.
According to Yle, the ownership of Kährs is carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-faceted institutional structure.
Mr. Berner tells Yle that he accepted a majority member of the Luxembourg branch, Kährs, at the request of the second largest owner.
The owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have participated in the public of Karelia-Upofor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partnership was sought which was found in Sweden.
The company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the reality of the Finnish family.
It is important that we ensure that the capital returns of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that the principle is safeguarded in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that the property of Hartwall Capital does not belong to a tax scheme.
According to Berner, the complex ownership of the tax system is due to the fact that Kährs's largest owner of the capital, Triton, already had a Luxembourg holding company for ownership.
The company’s new reception centre will be opened in Espoo.
The first company’s company’s reception centre will be opened in the territory of Espoo for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from this afternoon onwards.
The number of seats can increase within a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service is setting up a reception centre at the property of the former Finnish Rescue College.
The service is operated by Luuna Oy, which has a particular scope for the provision of health care and health care services.
The City of Helsinki, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy, among other things, agree on central security arrangements.
STÖ is working on an alternative work-life tightening package.
The Committee will take steps to prepare an alternative package for the public's working life to be tightened up.
There is also a hope for other consumer associations.
According to President-in-Office Palola, the current focus is on one statement.
The means to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone realizes that after the dawn of life, Palola called on the public administration meeting to take a break from the journalists.
Palola estimated that, on the other hand, the central industrial policy (EC) was not prepared for discussions.
The ESC's economists have calculated that the protection of the changes contained in the government's component package will cost the employer approximately EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm to discuss this conversation if there's a single relationship with one hundred.
Palola: The negotiations were constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) has hoped for alternatives by Wednesday, as it is due to submit its own package to Parliament and to begin the preparation of the reforms.
Palola did not take the view that the schedule was realistic.
The debate on the press is with the Papola, and it has been constructive all along.
According to the Fireola, the staff organisation’s staff organisation’s mission to the STK field is a tough place.
The organization requires that power be accused of forceful legislation, which would be part of the tensions.
In the STKKK, the Papola does not welcome the preparation of an option package with the SDP, the representative of the SDP.
The wage and salary earners are all over Helsinki to resist the last resort to the work-life tightening package.
As part of the package, the salary for the first few days of work is cut, the overtime is reduced to 75 %, the allowances are reduced to 75 % and the leave is reduced.
The ESC calls on the central bodies to invite employees to protest and has not intended to strike a strike.
Mrs Fjäder said something about the plan.
The President, Mr Fjäder, congratulates the JRC on the announcement that an alternative package has been prepared.
According to Fjäder, the TSI is now on the same agenda with Plana, as there is already a longer-term model for the presentation of the company.
The Fjäder hopes that Sak will also be included in the alternative package, without the SAK package being complete.
The President, Mr. Sture Fjäder, hopes that the SAK, led by Mr. Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare the presentation for the presentation.
The Anti Palolan TSI told me earlier on Wednesday that it was preparing new proposals.
Migration security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, he announced that he had already prepared his own presentation, which was prepared for the goal of 5% of the country's national food industry as an alternative to the company.
The plan has always been ready for the first time, and we have long been drawing up an alternative model for the presentations of the government.
We are prepared to maintain the general terms and conditions of employment as part of the agreement.
In contrast, we want security of change and working time banks," says Chairman Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that Sak will also come to the side of the plan, as the TSI has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without Sak, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing a model for the world and employers, Fjäder says.
The AA Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.

The Prime Ministers have previously made choices during the Mäntsälä rebellion and during the period.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks well of the nation's economic situation in Finland on the Upper Channel on Wednesday at 20.05 p.m.
The Prime Minister's first speech must be applied for until 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was supposed to be giving a famous radio call at the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The president and the ministers then made a number of conversations during the winter and the war on the future.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave President Mauno Koiisto instead of New Year's speech, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976 Mr. Urho Hekkonen quit the railway station on his mobile phone.
Dialogue, a multidisciplinary conversation, and I'm going to say something.
This talk has been asking all day about criticism and thinking about what I'm going to do.
President of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated in his knowledge that "The voice of the state of the nation in Parliament could be given as a statement by the Prime Minister, which would also make the speech very clear".
According to the Green Ville Juys, "the interlocutor has already been seen.
Management involves dialogue, listening to people.
The Erkki Juhja of SDP condemned the fact that "from the monarchist to the better: the truth tells the people what is right for it".
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A half a year from the elections, six months from the elections.
There is no need for an individual to appear in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you worried about?
public service
According to the Prime Minister's Office, Sipilä's speech has already been recorded for about 15 minutes and long.
According to SAK, it was commented directly on by the Chairman of SAK, Lauri Lyly, and the Executive Director of the EK Järämies.
The above has been criticised for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered the matter and concluded that a public service mission would contribute to the general public in the whole of the world, in the news, by Ismo Silvo Ylen, Director-General of the Ismo Silvo Ylen.
It's like our time in Tammalo.
The speech has also given rise to venerations.
At the latest, it will be day-to-day on time, the children will be combed and dressed at their best.
I'm going to put on the cutest bitch and my dad's going to make up for his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., we're going to be on the road as before, at the time of the Tammelós," literator Saku Tutnen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipila also say in his speech why there are millions of people sitting in the world in tax havens hiding their capital, who make love laws for other tax-governanced friends and at the same time claim to the people that they must be cut off when the government is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is put forward by the University of Tampere's Green Left Viva.
It has published a new edition of the next bingo.
Do we hear at the same time about the same drive, the common coal, the tax on living and the team?
The domes and pens are ready, at 9:05 p.m., it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Attaria in Guardian: Western countries reject the proposal for the withdrawal of al-Assad.
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected Russia's offer to give President Bashar al-Assad a mandate, tells President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to Astaris, the Russian Ambassador to the United Nations proposed a way in which al-Assad would have, at some point, retreated from power in a loud manner.
Therefore, the countries of the West did not take the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall every few weeks.
Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five Member States of the UN Security Council.
According to Astisare, the Russian Prime Minister, Vitali Tshurk, in his bilateral debate, listed three points: the opposition must not be armed, there must be immediate intervention between Opposition and Al-Assad, and the surrender of al-Assad had to be done smoothly.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on everything, but we can fight openly.
I told him what I was doing there, and he said that sitting down at Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtari remembers at the Guardian's interview.
Dilmats do not comment on dilates.
Ahtisaari tells us that he forwarded the message to the United States, the United Kingdom and the United States, but nothing happened.
The Czech Republic has not confirmed the content of the debate on the paper, but according to Ahtisaari, there is no two language.
The UN Diploms of the United Nations refused to comment on Ahtisaari's arguments, but they said that Al-Assad had already made a number of murders at this time and that the main opposition groups were seeking all the agreements that he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is concerned with Ahtisaari's speeches with doubts, because, according to his experience, Russia was not at all prepared to see the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting al-Assad all the time.
In a few minutes' time, Ahtisaari argues that the Czech Republic was speaking with the Moscow Council.
If he had told me about the words of the Czech Republic, I would have answered that I wanted to see the second President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
In fact, I would have doubted, in any case, that it would have been Putin's trick to keep hold of any al-Assad supporter.
Refugee our own actions.
During the negotiations in Ahtisaari, there were about 7 500 people in Syria who were in crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of death victims exceeded 220 000 in the next year.
Over 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes for their own sake.
We should have prevented this beast from happening.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doings.
All I can do is take good care of these poor people.
We're thinking about the bill that we've actually caused, Ahtisaari says to the paper.
The asylum seeker’s facility is a torty to Tornio.
The local asylum centre of the Government of Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The center of the city was built in a building of a complete tower building.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place to better manage theflow from the Swedish border.
The City of Sanomat knew on Tuesday that the Board would already have planned to prepare a school building for the Ministry.
According to the Vice-President of the Tornio Parliament, Mr Sauli Höppinen (left), that is not the case.
When the whole council was not convened and some of the people wanted an official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next year to decide on the matter, and he would specify it to the STT.
There were 36 out of 43 delegations in the current discussion.
The Centre was opposed by 13 delegations.
On that basis, it could be expected that the decision would be positive, says Heppinen.
According to Executive Director Timia Nousiainen, the city received an announcement on Monday, and it was promptly approached.
It would be possible to share an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has checked to see that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred metres from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
Siila still wants to be able to choose from the labour market for one another.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium), the half of the public holiday money would only be managed by part of the budget's aim of calculating the labour price.
However, the government will be happy to accept an alternative option if the social partners succeed in doing so.
Sipi told the journalists in Parliament that he had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how often organizations are looking for alternatives to the work that the government has announced.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will, of course, gladly accept it as part of the whole package.
The half of the holiday money would act as a way of thinking of Sipilä, as it would target almost all employees, rather than, for example, the cutting of a star designed by the government.
The social security organisations could agree on a holiday allowance cut because they are registered under the law as a collective agreement.
The government will report to Parliament on the tightening of working life as a government communication next Wednesday.
According to Sipilä, organisations' proposals should be known before this is the case.
The final date is not the last time either.
Legislative work begins at the time, i.e. the train is moving and it gets easier and harder all the time.
It's a good time now.
It's not too much in these matters, if you want to, Siilä spoke.
Among other things, the government's most recent publication has been the final and bright conversion into unpaid free days, without any exception of the annual working time.
In addition, the first day's pay is cut, the overtime is halved, the allowance is reduced to 75% and the leave is reduced to 75%.
Reforms will be carried out as a powerful law through trade unions, which has caused intense criticism.
Due to the efforts of the IGCs, the IGCs organise one major report, as well as several trade unions have announced the gross domestic product.
The Tohmajärvi Board approved the extension of the madman’s warehouse by the Board of Governors.
The Tohmajärvi Board has approved the extension of the North Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the manager’s store, but not the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall.
The assessment was made by the fact that the project is bigger and more expensive than the original one.
It's too busy to be angry.
Even a little wonder that the order was known a year ago when we decided on the last extension.
At this point, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 meters was approved for the investment programme, but the funding is decided on an average in the context of the interim report.
The next item is the debate on the investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but the president, Erkki Iconen, announced that the price would be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the grounds that it brings work and tax income to the place.
The municipality does not have any money, since the company pays for the sale as a loan, Vesa Väistö (ps.) argued.
There is also a place for Karelian language in Joensuu.
The government of the municipality has been easing its strong position in order to bring some of the plain signs in the cattle language to the centre of Joensuu.
The decision is important and proper for the organisation of the tradition of cattle throughout the country.
It does not belong to the capital of the cattle language, for there are no historical grounds for it, nor is the language of the herd naturally part of the region's life.
The language spoken in the river basin has become more widely known for the eastern savoury.
Not after the final decision, there will be no name signs in the cattle language at the centre of the city centre.
However, as a matter of fact, the river is well prepared for the use of the Swedish language, for example, in information boards and in the market in tourism, for example.
The same attitude is recommended by all other operators.
Although Joensuu is currently a single-voting municipality, it is also advisable to be open-minded about the use of the language of the harida now thatQuality is alive and is now changing in North Karelia.
Karelian language is now the special features of the region, as well as the image of the river as the forest of all of Finland.
Each of these can be well used for the benefit of the nation’s entire market.
The interruptions in the pipelines are a source of vitality in the region.
Train connections strike the country's vitality with a strong hand.
Transport connections directly affect the economy and competitiveness of the county.
And it seems to me that we can live and work here at all, as President-in-Office of Joensuu Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also raised the issue of aviation, which has also been the subject of several reports on several occasions.
For the country as a whole, it is important that we do not have the ability to reduce by means of government measures, as is the case now.
The effects of these disconnections should be seen, for example, for employment, and Karjalainen points out.
The lack of access will cause the University of Eastern Finland to seek additional attention in relation to the attractiveness of access.
Of course, the best things here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to have students and employees, the rector of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen knows.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels for a long time.
Marko Junkkarinen, head of the recruitment team, says that marketing of the university to West Finland is already difficult because the transport connections are very weak in cross-border terms.
Currently, about half of the students of the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Again, about 10-20% of them are from the U.S.A., which is partly explained by direct connection to the network.
Joensuu became one row for Siu's solo.
The view of the Government of Joensuu on the regional Siu Soite project seems to be unanimous, but there is also one voice among them.
Mr Pentti Kessalo (sd., p.
The Board of Governors adopted the draft decision of President Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of the month before the meeting of the City Council, which will give a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One weekend from Koupola to Koupola the end of next year.
Civil transport from Eagle to Kouvola will continue to survive, each less than one railing pair.
There will be a change in public transport between Kotka and Kouvola next year.
The two-way partnership is gone, but still five-times pass from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The discounts are the result of the State's transactions.
For the next four years, the Ministry of Transport and the Communications will reduce the amount of urban money to EUR 12.3 million for the next four years.
The most recent routes will be stopped completely.
VR will draw up new plans by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed away, one didn't get down, the guys were living off site.
The Civil Protection Department released a 12-year-old climber who climbed from the roof to the roof, who no longer helped himself down from the roof with his own help.
The event was born in Tornionmä, in Keto, at half-six o'clock on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to be taken from anywhere.
It did not stop the crowd that decided to climb the house away from it along the masts of the radiomagnators next to it.
Other boys got down the same route, but one of them didn't.
As a result, the rest of us were living from the place, and the passers-by alarmed the rescue unit to the place by means of a towing device, the last safe return to the earth for the rest of us safely.
FedEx's turnover is fluctuating, with poorer outlooks for the financial year 2016
FedEx published its weak point of the last quarter. The transport sector lost value estimates all year round due to the fall in demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The person who intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for a holiday.
This year, FedEx announced that he would employ 50,000 seasonal workers for the rest of the holidays.
The share accounted for about 2.5 per cent of the share 45 minutes before the actual trade opened on Wednesday.
The FedEx forecast is between $10.40 and $100 for the accounting year ending in May. It is estimated that there will be a drop of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the FactSet investigation, the analysts predicted 10.
In spite of an average price increase of 4,9 %, this increase will enter into force on 4 January.
The outlook is still looking forward to growth from the previous year due to cutbacks in costs, higher turnover and increased online trade.
Fred Smith, President and CEO, noted that the company has been very much looking forward to a weaker economic situation, which has been experienced in particular by production and global trade.
Investment plans for seasonal workers were informed of the day after the competitor UPS announced his plans to hire approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90,000 and 90,000 people.
In the fourth quarter of August FedEx's operating profit was 692 million dollars, which means a four percent increase.
The share of the result was 2, the number of dollars. Zacks Investment Research has thus remained for the analysis of the 12 dollar.
Turnover went down by five per cent to 12.3 billion dollars.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected at 12.23 billion.
In recent years FedEx has been experimenting with the number of nine first-class shipments, which is why the company's Express unit has been in a state of play.
Increased e-commerce has confirmed the outcome of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land sales was 29 per cent, but the turnover showed an increase in the cost of large consignments and insurances.
The entity produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the profit of the freight business decreased because of higher labour costs.
About one minute before the opening of the actual trade, FedEx's share price had dropped to $3,85 or 2.5 per cent to $12.15.
On Tuesday, the share fell by 11% from the average of the year and by 17 per cent from the highest listing recorded on 11 June.
This month, the decisions of the United States Central Bank Fed will meet for the most expected meeting in years. The team will arrive at a six-metre-long mesaic wooden table in diameter to decide whether it is time to raise the rate for the first time in the next half of the year.
The central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room is just outside of a wall painting representing the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must place the State's interests above all others.
The central bank has a date from the national central bank: maximise the investment in the United States and keep it stable here.
However, since the big recession, the central bank's head has noted the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be missing for a fiery decision. On Thursday, the Central Bank is due to announce whether the United States is prepared to return to the expected interest rate on the short-term interest rate of the United States of America close to the end of the year 2008.
Most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent economic downturn can lead to an already preliminary increase in the volatility of the central bank's officials by raising the reference rate of government taxes – even in one quarter.
"Work markets and inflation are, of course, the first and most important to them in their proper monitoring", says Lilsey M. Pigza, Chief Economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if on the one hand you are looking for an excuse not to levy taxes, the increased uncertainty in the global market is sufficient to give you sufficient reason to look forward to it," Piegza continues.
The questioners do not agree with what they are doing, which in itself causes clarity.
About half of the economists in Bémberg's study were swept up by the rise in interest this year.
As a consequence, the Central Bank is expected to wait on the market and, according to the main indicator, there is only a 30% chance of an increase.
If the central bank increases its interest rate, the share prices may be calculated so that the decision-makers do not allow for a second raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index cut by 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
"In the background to the inaugural activity were expectations that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this month," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Chief Economist John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank were to raise interest at this point," he said.
"If so, the Central Bank should consider precisely how to keep the hands of those who operate on the financial market without shaking."
On the other hand, the other experts noted that interest raising could help to bring about a smooth financial market and eliminate the uncertainty as to where the central bank operates.
A month ago, the central bank seemed to be raising the interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month.
Yelle has not said that along the spring and in the beginning she has expected an increase this year – despite the need for progress according to the liberals.
Job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell by 5.1 per cent last month, which is now at the lowest level of seven years and close to the level that counts as full employment.
Wage and salary incomes tend to increase.
At the same time, inflation continued to decline below the average annual 2% targets, and the central bank's decision-makers noted that the main reason for this is the sharp temporary effect of the prices of the market.
"Economics can take on higher interests and it needs them, as long as we take into account the difficult situation on the labour market," said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson.
However , the world market in the world will not fluctuate in the last month , when the currency of the Republic of Moldova is the currency of the Republic of Moldova .
Dow fewer than 16 percentage points from the record height of May and investors feared that the economic downturn would have an impact on global growth as well.
The market has been in the market this month, and Dow Jones has already fallen by nearly 10% from the peak of the year.
In the market, the decision-making process of the central bank makes it difficult for the central banks to think about raising the interest rate even more.
"The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened on the financial market and the news of the economic downturn in the country over the last few weeks," said Stephen D. Oliner, an investigator at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate, and former central bank official Stephen D. Olinker.
He now believes that the central bank will wait at least a month to handle the effects.
"There is a great doubt as to what will be the futures of the US economy. There is little reliable information about the recent developments in the economy," Oliner said.
Overall, the central bank should not be influenced by the central bank's decision-making process.
In practice, however, it is the most authoritative aspect of the world's monetary economy.
In recent years, the central bank's operation has been a major one.
In 2013, the only suggestion from President Ben S. Jannanke that he could narrow his activities to a great extent was the creation of revolutions around the world.
In addition to monitoring global developments, the Central Bank is also required to be contacted with other central banks and with the international financial institutions and with the international economy, so that it has a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The decision-making process of the central bank is more artistic than science," said Zachary Karabell, Director of the global strategy of the financial management of the Investnet Inin.
This month, President Jeffrey Lacker of the national central bank of Richmond said that the central bank had previously overreacted to financial market transactions that are not likely to be linked to the fundamental economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, who is a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has announced the increase in the lead rate, for example, the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis led to the decision of the Central Bank to calculate the advisory rate of 0.75 percentage points in three weeks, whereas at the most there were only limited certain sanctions for the United States of America", Lacker reported.
The President
"The central bank should give priority to financial stability only in a major context, such as the 2008 economic crisis," said Adam S. Posen, Member of the Central Bank of England's Public Interest Committee.
The latest mischief doesn't even come close to that kind of situation," he said.
"There is absolutely no point in fear of being afraid of market failure", says the Newson Institute for International Telemics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a universal mandate and does not mention monetary stability. Before this change comes, I do not think I should go ahead."

The Rio Granden Medical Association of Brazil helps to ensure a healthy diet for breast-feeding.
The Rio Granden Association of Doctors in Brazil (SPRS) has developed a very diverse way of teaching breast-feeding women the real meaning of being breast-feeding. They are given pictures of babies who are breast-feeding, painted with images of unhealthy grass.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and pesticides, which give the baby everything it needs and allows him to develop a strong immune system.
Because of total energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily target by about 500 kg.
In addition to increasing the target, further changes should be made, according to research.
A recent study by the Texas Baylor College of Medicine Professor Robert Waterland revealed that a healthy healthy diet can affect the genes of the baby and protect the baby from the development of tumours.
Undoubtedly, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the immune system of the child.
Seven's Sunrilla's biggest viewers, even though Nine is trying to catch the lead on Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Turkinson went to Canberra to make a morning programme on the follow-up to the Liberal Party Leaderial elections, which, however, did not greatly improve Today's audiences.
The Nine channel news program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull deported Tony Abbott.
David Koch and Samantha Armytáttah’s competing channel news program was sent from London. A few weeks later embassies will also be sent from Ž, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance seems to have been of no relevance to the national media, for Sunrise was seen as an average of 30,000 viewers in the three capitals of the state, and Today was 31,000 viewers.
Today's viewers returned to last Monday (37,000) and Tuesday (28,000) but remained on last Thursday (34,000).
Today has reached a distance from Sunrje in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average of 388,000 viewers, Sunris 3,30 000.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise is currently on the table with a total of 349 000 viewers and a total of 314 000 viewers today.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
The changes will take place at the beginning of this House more than before.
Karl and Lisa are fine, ask questions.

Significant news Seven had a 800 News news series with a former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The news drama is about the father who has recently fallen asleep, who will change the coast of New Zealand to two of his children. The new novel has reached the top 1 219 000 viewers.
Critics have doubted whether there is enough Thomson's hit series alone, without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
According to last night's viewers, the answer is clearly positive.
Seven The X Factory maintained its strong position with 1 136 000 viewers. The series was defeated in the great glory of The Block (838,000) and the TBL Familias series (€6,000).
Seven The Chase Australia has held the viewers at the same time.

According to the Final Three, Sam Wood really is the son of the Dreams — but does the man choose?
Has the secret been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have deliberately revealed the choice of the Master of Dreams.
The final choice of the dream boyfriend Sam Wood was a very well-preserved secret.
The three remaining women do not have a single word about who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We were asking about the atmospheres of Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, before the three points out of one.
At the same time, the lips are well sealed until Thursday's finals.
All three were fascinated by the fact that Wood is a man. Women praised the man’s sense of humor, ambition, family values and strength, and considered him to be a suitable partner in character.
When asked who would be the most suitable partner for some, if the last rose did not match their own, their answers may be to give an indication of who would take the man's life.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski play quickly after Mackay as the most suitable partner for the State.
Everything between Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood has been going smoothly from the start.
"As soon as I arrived in the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam are well together. This feeling has survived all the time," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's a very funny company," Markoski added.
"I've seen each other together, and I have to say that there's a problem between them.
They seem to be a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay's all right, Sam. She's all right.
Mackay told me that he realized last week on a home date that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a contest. I'm starting to see our relationship fully," Mackay said.
The king was asked who Wood would choose if he did not meet him, one in mysterious terms:
"I can't do it," he said.
"I like all the other girls as much as Snezana and Lana are quiet."

Jarryd Hayne has many options for the NFL career initiative.
Detroit and Seattle were very excited about Hayne's transformation to the United States, and several other clubs also became involved after last year's impressive open day of training.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it seems to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have held Hayne on the bench, as was the case for the Australian rugby country team in order. Hayne sent a jet shot to the return team to win the victory on Tuesday from D.C. from D.A. to D.C. 20-3.
However, the Tomsula showed his confidence in Hayne and gave him another chance to return the flight kick. The coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bus was injured.
Tomsula also went on the line in the suit after the game.
He didn't bring in the rest of the team, he created these.
Tomsulo also defends Hayne publicly after the game at the press conference.
49 Special Editor Cam Inman that Hayne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised Hayne to forget the failed capture and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is going to take the take-off, the first quarter of the game played against Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been expecting someone else from NFL debut.
Hayne left hundreds of places after she died and later told Hamish and Andy, the 2 DayFM 104.1 channel, that it could not have been imagined that the NFL could not have been a worse start.
"These happen and need to move forward," said Hayne.
Hayne made a comparison with his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when he entered his own area in Queensland.
The whole thing was amazing for a 27-year-old youth.
Hayne has published a imaginative picture where she poses together with the fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are discussing gay rights.
In 2003, the most powerful man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at gunpoint in Siberia.
Openly called by President Vladimir Putin to the Court of Hodorkovski, a man-owned company in Juko was deported and his work in favour of democracy was extended.
The police shot down with rubber bullets in protestors in Nepal.
The man was killed in South Nepal, first reported on Wednesday. He shot a gang of rubber bullets in the country in a protest against the alleged new constitution. Among the victims was a son of four years old.
On Tuesday evening, violence occurred in the Rupande area, almost three hundred kilometers from the capital of Katmandus.
According to district manager Sishinu Prasa Dhakal, more than 1,000 protesters had been formed outside the station, some of which had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that he was using tear gas and fired into the air before shooting rubber bullets.
According to him, two policemen and five wounded.
It is not quite clear why rubber bullets, which, of course, can kill but which are generally considered to be a less dangerous option, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the latest gain in weeks of continued protests at Nepalese levels, where, according to Madhes, new constitutionalally-based nations would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus tribe requires its own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have been killed in violent madness since 10 February,
on which the four major parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces. It is a big step forward, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the regime has been averaged for centuries.
The new Constitution has been in place since 2008, but the legislation has accelerated the process since the dawn of a major earthquake.
The legislators have voted on the Constitution clauses in Tamandus this afternoon, and I believe that the new Charter could be adopted in favour of this decision.
NHC Circling Center: 60% probability for the cyclone south of Cape Verde.
About 560 km from the vast area of the active substance, 60% of the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands are likely to develop a tropical cycle within the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday by the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) in the United States.
According to the SAA, there is also a clear pressure centre in the middle of Cape Verde and the Little Altles, which is also likely to transform into a tropical cycle in the next two days.
The Bank intends to raise $11 million in support of refugees.
Google In (GOGL.O) has announced that it will launch a campaign to raise $11 million in humanitarian aid to organisations that are working across Europe for thousands of people who have fled from war and poverty.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of leading the campaign, Google's co-worker Rita Masoud told him about the other. He was only seven months away from Kabul with his family.
"We traveled in the dark by bus and by bus and starved, thirsty, cold and afraid," Masoud wrote.
I'm lucky.
In the face of the crisis in Europe and in the face of immigration, many of the rest of the world are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be awarded to unsuspecting organizations that help refugees and immigrants: You are trying without borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save Children and the United Nations Asylum Office.
After the donations have been collected to Google.com/refugeerelif via 5.5, the Commission will contribute an equivalent amount to 11 million.
The European refugee crisis is worse than the Second World War, particularly in Syria's four-year civil war, which has caused more than four million people to fall from their homes this year.
War will also be waged in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight honeycombs may have an effect on the meat product.
According to the study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetes patients may be at risk for at least one year of exposure.
It is, however, too early to say whether slightly overweight Type 2 babies are longer after obesity than those who are being treated for homelessness.
"It will take some time to get information on mortality," explained Dr. Fatty's expert, Robin Blackstone, who was working on new research in JAMA Surgery.
Homelessness, i.e. bariatric surgery, reduces stomach bag by various methods.
Surgical methods restrict hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
During the course of the year, bariatric treatments have been found to be the most important formulations in type 2 diabetes, but most of the studies have concerned overweight patients with a BMI (BMI) of at least 35.
The printing index shall indicate the weight and the length with which the value is between 1.5 and 24.9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index over 30 represents a significant weight gain.
You can calculate your own body weight index at 1.usa.gov/D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers at the Taiwanese Min-Sheng Hospital took advantage of the data collected since 2007 in a study where there were two types of muscle surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gynaecological surgery, type 2 diabetes treatment in mildly obese subjects.
After weight gain, the average body weight index was calculated from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The body mass index of patients who received non-surgery therapy remained unwell.
The number of patients treated with sores improved completely in 36 and in part in 28 years.
In the treatment-treated group, the overall improvement was only 1 % and in general only about 2 %.
In addition, the study showed that the patients who received surgery were better treated with the medicine, with the use of triglycerides and with the use of poor LDL-C.
The investigators also followed up on haemoglobin levels of A1c, which corresponds to the increase in the level of equality.
According to the investigators, the recommended haemoglobin level for A1c is less than 7 per cent.
After the surgery, the average haemoglobin A1c was calculated from 9% to 6%.
The proportion of patients treated was approximately 8%.
However, the study group conducted by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over a period of several years.
The group also compared the consequences of two different methods of analysis.
In the fifth year, weight loss in the gastric bypass was higher than in the hive cutting arm (18,7 and 14,2 kg), the change in the body mass index was higher (7,4 and 5.1), as in the A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %). In the control arm, the proportion of patients in the control arm also improved completely (46,9 % and 16.7%).
However, according to the Swedish study of Blackstone, who works at the University of Arizona University of Medicine, the operation of surgery in the United States of Arizona was not able to produce a smaller mortality after six years.
In the Swedish study, the incidence of death during 15 years was reduced by 29% of the subjects who had received conventional treatment by those who had undergone gastric bypass surgery, compared to those who had received traditional treatment.
However, according to Blackstone, although no fewer reality was found in the recent study, it was confirmed that persons with a body weight of less than 35 would benefit from the measure.
"This is the most recent investigation, as it says that the operation is safe in the lower body body of weight indexes, and does not increase the risk of death or real disease", Blackstone.
According to Black, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is between 27 and 30.
"We expect people to start taking the situation seriously," said the investigator.

"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, the Dalai Lama has said, and according to it, the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leading figure of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in the refugee countries.
Dalai-lama discussed the refugee crisis in her speech in the United Kingdom. Dalai-lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the present situation, mankind will be put ahead of the individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the reaction of Western European countries to the crisis is admirable, it is not enough in this context.
"It is impossible to think that everyone will come to Europe," Dalai-lama said in her speech.
Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their action in the event of a crisis, stressing that the decision was only temporary.
"The care of thousands of refugees is a great thing to do, but at the same time there are long-term solutions and how to bring about real peace and real development in these Islamic countries, namely through education," the Dalai Lama stressed.
"At the end of the day, we need to understand how we can prevent killing in these countries.
The use of power must be reduced.
The resources have never been solved," he added.
In his comment on violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the context of the 11th of September terrorist attacks and claimed that, when resorting to forceful acts, the United States brought about an uncontrollable process of events.
"After the attacks on 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the decision would come through violence.
I know that his purposes were good, but he resorted to forces that had unforeseen consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In my hand, cases of ingestion have quadrupled over a period of six months.
According to the Georgia Intoxication Board, poison centres across the United States tell about their alcohol content with a strong concept of ingestion in nearly four times the age of 12 in children under 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgian Intoxication Department, reports of manual ingestion to poison centres in children under 12 years of age increased from 3 to 266 in 2010 to 16 in 2014.
"These products are more and more common for children and, unfortunately, some of the children will have to go to first aid," Lõz told CNN.
According to Alz, children drink handicrafts deliberately, share in doing things for themselves and part of social media.
There are teenagers in YouTube videos who drink disinfectants because of poor drunkness.
Tein is reported to be a mixture of disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to make it stronger than drink.
Smaller children can be attracted to the smell of hand-helds.
"The child doesn't think it's bad," Lopez said.
"Many of the attractive hand-held products have just been perfumed.
There are handicrafts that taste like strawberries, grapes and oranges, which appeal to children."
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is between 45 % and 9 %.
A small amount of children may already be affected by alcohol poisoning.
"The alcohol content of handicraft is very high", scientific director of the U.S. Hospital’s Intoxication Center, Stephen Thornton, told the Fox 4 Channel in Kansas City.
"No one would leave a children-to-be whiskey shot, but if hand disinfecting products are often left to the children-to-be, there will be an immediate increase in the amount of tax."
The month Nhijah Russell was on the market for four months ago, while the young girl was still in school, and was submitted to her next step in order to be treated.
"The absolute blood alcohol content was 179, which is two times that of a adult," says a doctor named Chris Ritchey from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Yeah, well, your camera couldn't get away when he was brought to the front door.
He followed me every night in a separate child's hospital for brain damage, for the girl had fallen and knocked her head off after drinking," Ritsey said.
"You were really awesome," Nhaja's home Ortora Scott told the CNN.
My daughter could have happened.
It has recommended parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants, in addition to the fact that your concept is to be moved into the child's reach.
In addition to alcohol, some of the disinfectants are fatal.
In 2013, two of the women in the United States died from the ingestion of handholds, which included a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities thought that the active substance in the product was a lethal methane instead of ethyl alcohol, the most important one being the active substance in this leaflet.
According to the report, three fourth-class students in the north of the state of New York planned to kill a "bad" teacher in January by creating an anti-Second Room of Anti-Seconds.
The teacher is very allergic to hand-helds and has banned it from being brought into the bedroom.
It was found that the plan to go along was pointless and called for disciplinary action.
Humour: there is no disunity in the order of Celtic.
Giffith detracts from the celtic team, while Delila states that the team is not all right, but believes that it will be all right.
Hearts days against the SFA forcing Neilson, and Warbubton is holding back his transfers so that the team does not support the unity of the team.
Aberdeen neck in Celti
ADAM Rooney's first half sentence resulted in Aberdeen's loss of victory from Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen's five-point escape from Celtic.
Giffiths lacks talk about infrequentness
According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not being watched as they are preparing to meet the President.
"I don't think we're under pressure.
Dutch people need a old Scottish dialogue – de Boer
The first Raggers middle-level player and the British national team player Ronald de Boer have found that the interest of Dutch fans in Celtic has ceased to exist and that there is no longer any chance of follow-up to the two-competitions between Celtic and Rangers.
De Boer, who is a team leader of the timex, said: "The Dutch no longer present the main points of the Celtic game. Why?
Because the Powers is no longer involved."
"This isn't just about the Rangers.
It's about Old Firm.
Dutch people need double-crossing between teams.
Old Firm's game has a tremendous tension and also cares about them outside Scotland."
Turn it around, Deila's conviction.
RONNY Dela admits that Celt is having a hard time, but the Norwegian character assures us that it will change.
The lost club in Malmöle fell from the Masters League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, which now has a five-point lead on the table tip.
"Celt has had difficult periods before, and we're coming back again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as soon as possible.
The situation is very disturbing, and it is a source of pain or pain in many people.
Both of us, but we have to move forward.
We urgently need the support of Celtic's support, as it significantly strengthens players.
Our spirit is really important right now."
Waburton was the first time in the Danish business transfer to Waburton in the Czech Republic.
Just a few months ago, the Rangers boss Mark Warburton pointed out that January was the subject of a series of cross-breeding sites, and he is very concerned with the transplant movement and says that he wants to compromise the team's integrity.
"The player transfers in January differ considerably from summer transfers," said the ex coach at Brentford.
"The team will be able to get used to the team before the beginning, which has succeeded in this period.
The team is doing really well.
Unnecessary player deals can harm the team more than good."
Mr Cilti's aim is to raise awareness of life in Michu.
The Swansean arsonist Michu has been attached to Celtic on a mobile phone. Michu has been concerned about retirement since the end of the Swans agreement.
Michu, aged 29 years old, has been an infuriating ankle and has failed to move from Wales in the summer.
Hearts is ready to comment on the comment by Neilson at the SFA Centre.
Hearts led to 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team lost at least 3-2. The defense red card was translated later. It is already the third Collum red one within three months, which will be cancelled.
However, Mr. Neilson remains behind his words. "I did not question the truth. I did not comment on the performance.
Giffiths swears he wants Tynecastlea.
Giffiths were reviled when the man was limping at his bibles about his former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in the New Yorkeseburn area of Edinburgh before the local event in Edinburgh in Tynetalle in March 2014.
"There was a local meeting, and the atmosphere was intense," the exorcist said. "I can assure you that I will not go back to Tynecate except in the correctness of Celtic."
The Tannadice Executive Board will launch the Dundee United Training Management – Donnelly.
Simonnelly is convinced that the Dundee United Executive Board can turn the world into a better one, and that surrender can no longer be allowed on the field.
"Stepen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes happy Hamilton win a dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was undoubtedly forced against Hamilton for his seven consecutive defeats. In fact, Aberdeen was hit by five points in the neck of the celtic at the top of the agenda, which is a thanks to Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half of the sentence.
"there is no Cup team or team of assassins who would not have won the games," McInnes said.
Unemployment remains in Scotland, rising in the British Islands.
Employed persons without change in Scotland, May to July. The total number of unemployed persons in all these statistics is 11,000.
According to the Office for National Statistics, the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, compared to 5.5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The number of employed persons in Scotland is 12,000 less than three months. The number of employed is now 2 612 000.
The Scottish employment rate fell to 74.0% in the quarter, while the average employment rate in the United States is 7%.
Minister for Scottish Affairs David Mundoll commented on the recent figures: "The long-term plan of the administration has created a solid economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland became part of the United Kingdom's historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has improved.
Why am I following an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no real grounds for withdrawal, I will follow execution.
If the execution is executed, which I do not want, I will sit in the execution room of the Penitentiary in Oklahoma State when Richard Glos is executed with a poison spray.
Gloss has sent you to one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation by the husband’s best friend, and despite my anxiety, I gave an invitation with approval.
In the middle of the day, I'll be terrified.
Then did I?
I agreed because I could tell you the truth about the death penalty.
The perspective would be unique.
Journalists will be able to follow executions in the United States, and when there are more requests than places, participants will be selected with a maaco value.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of operators from 4 to 5.
The following executions have been selected in moderation:
I can't do it.
I have created a man in a personal relationship, for we have been talking in the home for several months, and my visit took two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We often laugh when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present in the capacity of both the witness and the reporter, so I cannot bring a notebook and a note to make a note.
I just have to try to get my mind on the details.
One of the Oklahoma journalists accused me of jeopardising party life.
"The underlying idea is this:
When you tell a judgmental story to him in an acceptable way, you get close to him."
I presented the reporter with a different mind.
The editor is aware of the fact that he could have worded more carefully, but still thinks that my actions are correct.
Richard Glos has disagreed on some of the things that I have said and written.
He will not determine what I am writing, and even if he tries to tell me, I will not tell you what to do.
I've been telling him that he can remove me from the calendar at any time.
However, he sees an international journalist who can see what has happened.
If Glossian dies, he believes that the public will promote the movement against the death penalty.
Huffington Post editor Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can watch my podcast mission.
I am not going to repeat the details in this context.
I can't believe Richard Glosi's gone.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, his actions will ensure that he is helped after the crime.
However, I believe that there is a good reason that a man named Glos is not guilty of murder.
I am assuming that the evidence of the judgment was not sufficient to justify it.
I think his purpose is wrong.
From now on, his execution follows.
I can't argue that I'm not partial to a party.
Unbiased description of other editors' cases can be changed.
I'll tell you what it's like to watch a man die.
He was lured from Canningjoe after a five-way police hunt.
Officer of the Canning Vale area remained dry as he lured me up from Canningjoy.
A man of perth fled behind you into a hare, a mud in water. A few metres away, he got me back to the country of origin.
The Canning Valen police received a call on Tuesday from their unauthorised stay in Beckenham.
When the police arrived, they discovered a suspect who was trying to turn the police from his point of view to the Canning River.
However, I do not think so.
"The man in the water told me that he would not come out of the water and tell the police to get me into the water," said Petty Officer Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhaveic was not challenged by the immersion of the uniform, so he changed the best of the tactics – the discussion.
"Sometimes, escape will cause you to resort to interesting means," said Sergeant Castledine.
The case of the Conquest Ben Cousin is an outstanding example.
In 2006, the Cousins abandoned their car to catch a police blow and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man’s work was doomed to destruction, but the rapture inspired the locals into the world of Ben Cousins.
According to Peter Moody, operators are trying to spy on him, and he threatens to stop competing.
Peter Moody is accusing Racing Victoria's employees of keeping a spy company last year. He threatened to stop trading immediately.
Mody claims that the officials and the Board of Defense of Racing Victoria have personally attacked him, and the abandonment of Lady Tatai for the last day of the race was one little bit on Wednesday due to the treatment given on the day of the race.
Mody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do things for sports in the world, and she's had trouble finding a cobbit on Lidar's play, and he couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue down on spying charges for a year and a half, and he does not want to feel guilty about the activity of a broken man.
"I wasn't going to raise the issue. I was going to think about this for a while, but sometimes frustration breaks down at the moment," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"There is a need to react and accept the consequences. I must now accept when I have opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm going to sleep fine.
I want the owners of the home to believe what I can do.
If the owner doesn't believe it, I don't want to go on as a horse coach anymore.
"I should think of my future as a cooperative coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where he told me about the plot of espionage companies in his stables.
"One and a half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable for the purpose of spying on my actions. On request," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They believe that I am a fraud.
That's right, they should show the evidence, and I'm not getting caught up in anything.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie and the Executive Director-General of RRL, were informed of the state of play and the state of play of the art.
Do I have to keep my head down for a real chaser?
Should RVL take real action and take responsibility for matters other than coaching?
Am I in the field?
Am I really a six for the industry?
Perhaps a lot of people think so.
I think I'm still going to be a training license and push me away from what I'm doing.
I'm still at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I'll run away from them to make their own decisions.
My family will support me, and I can withdraw."
The long-lasting Cobalt Values of Lidar and the latest abandonment made the coach very frustrated in the long run, so that he threatened to give up his screen.
Moody is best known as the coach of the unbeatable master, Black Caviar, who described the rules of care of the day as ridiculous after the clay-staining saviour had been set against the feet of the horse.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I'll take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"The person in my staff wrongly put clay on the leg.
The clay was supposed to do anything.
It could have been done by yesterday, and both of them could have been done by day.
But it happened on the day of the contest."
You can expect a three-month period of justice for the anti-procedural clay treatment that the organisers have begun to understand.
"This is a joke.
The work has been prepared by someone who does not know the body at all.
Sure enough to understand the need for the rules, but this is too far gone," Moody said.
Arrested by those who fled the Cobrami crash.
He's arrested a guy on the bike. He's got me running away from a mess.
A cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car crash at Murray Valley High on the morning of yesterday morning.
According to my family, the man who drove the car escaped from the spot and did not stay away from the cyclists.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia arrived at the police station in Shepparton on Monday.
There is a likelihood that there will be accusations of failure to comply with the obligations to discharge and assist in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old biker from Cobra is still in hospital, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm's coach Craig Bellamy is referring to opponents' push-ups.
Mr. Blair Storm's coach, Craig Bellamy, considers the criticism of the game of return to his team as the main search operation of the two Leagues of the NRS.
According to Roman coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm's wrestling to the Melbourne fathers at the semi-finals in Sydney on the middle of the night.
Coach of Brisbane Broncos Jones Bennett covered a hard reference to Stormi Broncos won the finals at the Queensland Cowboys tomorrow night. He called the game a model and said that in Queensland, he was especially involved in the fight.
Bellamy defended his own team in the game and said that they only focused on the matter at his own place.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team was added by the fact that two senior team coach critics criticized his team. Bellamy considers this to be an opportunity to make the coach worry about losing to Storm.
"This is what first comes up. I remember Trt Newsson not talking about the fight when his team beat us 24 hours a week," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we have not changed our defense system or we have done anything all year long. The last three weeks we have just talked about the games and the tats that have turned us into an end.
Trent has been on duty for three years. Loss may have been a talk of shock because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It is funny that the same thing always comes up from the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Mr. Author on what was interesting about football. He reminded himself that Mr. Bennettin St. George-Illawarra Dragons won the attack in 2010 by playing dumb football.
"Wayne is talking about interesting football.
He compared his own team from the second game to our new game and thought their game was interesting", Bellamy said.
"In 2010 St Georgea got a lot of criticism about his boring game. Wayne concluded that there was nothing to stop him from doing anything.
Now he's got a team capable of playing so-called football, especially his young people, his big middle-time.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player arsenal is like this.
He stressed this year. Now he wants everyone to play in his way. Not every team has Anthony Milifen and Ben Hunt-like center-doors.
This gives more confidence when other trainers are on my team's side, so that you will resort to this kind of thing.
Six months ago, they didn't really think they were gonna meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that Stormin and Rooss played more games than Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was just a game. I'm not a game, but what was the end result? 16-12?
Our game's final result was 20-8.We were more in situations than that, but is it interesting for us to learn?
Or are game breaks and aluminance interesting weather?
Makes the goals interesting.
If they lock us up, we'll just face them."
The Storm is on the loose, as the team will be able to come for the next Saturday, either the North Queensland Cowboys' Cronies Sharks tomorrow morning at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
A member of the European Parliament, who is a member of the European Parliament and of the Council, has released 200 000 million bail in a drug case against a drug case.
A 40-pound cocaine holding company smuggled into Queensland has released a man waiting for a life sentence against 200,000-dollar bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month by the police on a 100 kilos of cocaine cargo from the Solay ship that had arrived through the Vanuatud South America and came to the port of Coomera in August.
A survey of the meeting of Maksimovic and his fellow killers was held at the port in the afternoon, and a couple of days later he caught a surprise at the Coomera city coffee shop, which found a 40-pound drug in the car that was parked in the Toyoto Echo.
In the opinion of the man, there is no evidence, according to his owner, that his head would have tried to take over the whole lot, which he may have had in his labor for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maksimovic will try to escape from the country.
"Maximovic has a clear connection to the ground.
He travels frequently", the judge was found in court on Wednesday.
"He's a cop in his place of residence."
The mother and the husband of Maximovic were jointly responsible for the 22,000 guarantees that were released.
"After reading the voluntary evidence of both parties, it is clear that 200,000 dollars is a real burden," said Judge Flanagan.
"But it is not the only thing to prevent a man from being driven away", Your Honor.
Maximovic was released on condition that he gives up his status in both Australia and Serbia, announces to the public daily and continues working from six to six hours.
Stevan Hogg was looking for a phone call to get the pedophiles to send a picture.
The patient used an 11-year-old watch to get control of the pictures where the child was being abused.
Stevan Hogg took a phone in bed and registered to an online message service where he received another user to send you inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, after he woke up, the girl went missing on the phone and realized it was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she went through her phone, she made some sort of up-to-date messages, and she immediately told me about it.
These five images were reported to the police, and after looking at the address of the computer, they found a search for open Internet applications using search words to search for inappropriate child photos.
Hogg was accused of trying to mislead the pedigrees on the ground and making the pedigrees look like he was trying to scare the pedigrees.
Prosecutor Eilith Robertson, in a local court of justice in the Dundee Sheriff's Court of Justice, observed: "You are supposed to be dependent on the intimidation of people.
He did the graves on a computer, but he saw it doing so to make the police and thus to scare the pedigrees.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and from whom Hogg was more.
Hogg claimed that his intention was to mislead the pedigrees.
He told me that he had a lot of interesting thoughts when he was drinking and wanted to look at pictures of rapes and murders.
Robert added: "When we found the messages from the phone, the funny screamed and cried."
He saw the wrong pictures on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
It was reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk about the girls who seemed far worse than they did.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road recognised charges for the possession of inappropriate child photos in the 14th year. Hogg broke bail on 25th of January this year and refused to come in this 24th year.
Defence attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be entered in the register of criminal offences, as it can be considered that the crime did not have any significant sexual characteristics.
Shei Alistair Carmichael suspended the sentence to work because of background social work reports.
Hogg was given an amendment to bail in this respect, but he was held in prison on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the criminal record before the date of the judgment.
The Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe is holding the wrong speech in the ministry.
Mugabe, the oldest head of state in Africa, fell in the stairs leading to the speaker's height earlier this year.
Mugabe did not hurt, but the video of the event spread rapidly in the media.
Parliament's openings were also countered by the arguments made by opposition legislators that they had received anonymous curfews in which they were warned not to dare Mugabe during his speech.
During the last month, the Members of Parliament were humming and interrupting on interlocutors the speech on the state of the President. The President gave the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the bishop of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change) said that the seven opposition politicians had received texts in which they were urged not to speak without exception to Mugaben.
"The message has been sent from a unknown number, but the title of the message is "death", Gonese told the editors after Mugabe had spoken.
The message warns the addressees that the representatives of the outside Parliament are no longer within the scope of immunity.
According to the party's fall, Morgan Tsvangira's leading party is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is up to 30 000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings of the business.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and will distinguish between computer and printer businesses from growing business and services.
According to HP's information, the company records a one-off cost of USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter onwards.
"Recommendation will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Superintendent Meg Whitman of the HP, who will lead the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company than the current HP, and we have extensive and deep portfolios that will help companies to move into new business styles." Whitman said.
"On our own, our position is better than ever, and we are better able to respond to our customers' changing world-wide needs."
Hewlett Packard Company's annual turnover is over $50 billion and the company concentrates according to its mission to deliver unique integrated business solutions to businesses.
The company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s is now divided into two.
HP has been undergoing massive transformations as traditional desktop computers are moving to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer and the United States of America's largest technology-based HP changes are the newest transformation in a sector that is believed to bring success to concentration.
Head of Arsenal Mikkel Arteta: The team must be supported by the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb meets.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that there is only one point. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly miss at least the next four national poker games.
The biggest problem with the last problem is that Wilshere went on to move in the last month after a much more stubborn period and seemed to have returned to his previous shoulder during a new period.
"This kind of disability does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"lu didn't get it right.
It is not a serious injury.
It was just a warning.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
Scientificly, this may be the case, but as Wengger said, additional injuries can come when the player tries to return to the field in the next few days.
There is also an inefficiencies here.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different kinds of trouble since Wilshere debuted three years ago.
He also played in Arsenal's ranks in only 65 out of 157 matches in the last five months.
The largest picture of Arsenal is that, between 2007 and 2007, six out of eight teams have been one of the teams that lost money because of the most injuries.
Wenger accepts a possible nodark circle, but Arsenal believes that last month, the completed injury statistics continue to improve in the better direction.
"Some post-injury returns may be associated with a period of fragility in which it is necessary to encourage and seek competition", Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be fine.
I hope he gets his sense of balance, I believe in it, and that means that his career will be what he deserves."
Arsenal will start his Masters' league on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will face Chelsea on Saturday and Totttenham Hotspur on the following Wednesday. Wenger will prepare for changes in the composition.
Monitor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely beginners.
Wenger can also set up an initial assembly to replace Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud's Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcottin.
"I try to take care of the team's balance and give it some rest", Wenger said.
Arsenal is the newest favorite F-group to succeed, and Maximir Zagreb is one of Europe's most fearsome stadiums.
Dinamo has also been a invincible 41-time game for the game.
On Tuesday night, the earth was shaking with a force of 3,2 Richter.
It was the tenth in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arkenal has learned his loss in the last few months after he has turned to Monaco. He is also still motivated by a far-flung desire to create a team towards the European championship.
"We have a huge energy charge", Wenger said.
"There is still no sign of this title on the arcenaal.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, I am also real with my experience.
We are ambitious, but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truths about man-to-man friendship.
A similar description shines in the absence of the other series. It is equal, especially given that the opening of the subject is more than ever and that the statistics on young people are at most 15 years old.
2013 was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom. Suicide is three times more common than women.
The goal of the campaign is to seek a culture that prevents men from applying for the help of their family members.
Friendliness is a real-life thought.
In the recent study, 2,000 Greeks were interviewed, and the study shows that the potential for improvement in patients with depressive symptoms is better if there are enough healthy people around them.
The likelihood of ill persons being ill was halved if they were close to people who had no mental health.
The basis, however, is the circumstances.
Modern communication is dominated by the media, and communication is often more important than communication. A fast response is often considered more important than a meaningful contact.
With the help of digitalisation of life, the need seems to be strong, strong and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image and social roles that are associated with Pinan success, all of them take note of the inner values and the natural growth and of course our consciousness. Internal values seem to our mental health deeper.
A millionaire in the video game recently concluded that money really cannot buy luck.
The fineness of the identifiers was that one turned the top of his head.
None of the characters are defined by the status or personality, which was displayed under conditions.
The series featured humorously Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football in their TV chairs, and we also saw Ross often missing Rachel.
One volunteer worker explained to me this: "As I listen to depressed and oblivious people, it is clear to me how many of the smallest members of the family can do.
The way we get in touch with each other is often impossible to talk about again.
The traditional idea that a man should be killed is strong. We are considered weak if he speaks of his problems."
"Frendet is one of the first series of long-term survival methods.

Angel Di Maria spoke with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan on his way to the goal against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in her goalwork in the Masters' League debut and was able to play the P.S.G. on Tuesday for the Swedish team Malmö.
Game report and release.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were struck when partner St. Germain began his work at the Masters' League by hitting Malmön Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French masters immediately in hand. However, the PG screwed up several points before they were able to add up: Cavani in your country after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A-section also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish mayor. PSG is not only aiming for the future in playoffs, but it also wants to improve its positions for the quarters in the three remaining matches.
Despite getting the points, the match was not a perfect show for the team piloted by Laurent Ši. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his goal and man to change when he was facing his former home, where he started his great career in the year.
"The league of masters is not easy to play at home or at guests, so 2-0 winnings and good ones for the bottom, even if we still have a good time to cheat on," she said.
"He knows better than that.
We were thirsty to win, and we were able to do it. True, we were confused that we were not able to make one or two outbacks."
Ibrahimović came back to the team after he got hit in the line. The team found himself satisfied at the end of the 2 tie games in the Lgue 1 series against Bordoux. However, Di Maria is hiding Ibrahimovic for four minutes.

He proved worthy of his name by thanking him for the pitching of the ball Marco Compare by Malmö's defense and then by the exact hit the back of the goal by right Wiland.
However, those who have expected to be ousted by PYG will be disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic in the playoffs, marched into the field nine-tier games from the start. Five men in defense and two players in tactics had to win the team.
Nikola Djurdjic's round went almost past Kevin Tapp's rear pole in the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack too much.
On the other hand, the PSG fell into a sense of feeding and a weak finish, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five targets only in the first half.
However, Ibrahimov showed his nails in the input game. From Ibrahimov's feed, Di Maria shot the trigger at Wiland at 52 minutes after 52 minutes.
One goal was created by Count Cavan, who was shot in full by a warrior who played through his head when Ibrahimovic fed him his left man for the job of working at +372.
Malmo's letter ended in another goal, and only the Wiland's top resistance from David Luiz's near-air range kept the shot in check, and the Ezequiel Lavezz goal was abandoned at the end of the mile when it came to the switch bench.
Malmö piloted the Åge Hareide after that PAG was his own section. "We played last year's Masters League game last December.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, where the game is not the same.
Cardinals are not enough.
You're a couple.
This was their best shot."

"The diversity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the committee", Damon said.
Brown was surprised and injured by the argument. "Wow, that's it," he said, "after Damon's comment on the Single Marissa film.

"Whoever is the director, I would like to encourage you to consider how Harmony's character is presented," said Brown at first.
"The only dark character is a prostitute, who has sex with his gay partner."
