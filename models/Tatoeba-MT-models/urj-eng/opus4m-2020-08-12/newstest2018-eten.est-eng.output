Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain.
According to the postman, the police stopped the so-called Kemerovo Group leader Slava Gulevitch, who is known as Slava Kemerovsky in the world of crime.
In Spain, Gulevish was arrested on trial.
Yesterday, the court also arrested a prisoner in a third country.
There is doubt that there are so-called members of the Kemerovo Criminal Community at the age of 27 years, who are mainly committing crimes of crime.
The alleged leader of the criminal community was held in Mija, Spain, in the Province of Malaga, in Mija.
In Estonia it was held guilty, one has been collected according to the criminal community's lead figure, and two is a member of the community.
All the data provided suggest that in the criminal community, the functions and roles shared had been reversed.
The purpose of the criminal community’s action was to commit criminal offences and thus to serve the crime,” commented the director of the case, Public Prosecutor, Võur Verte.
"We do not rule out any change in the circle of suspects in this case," said the Prosecutor.
These are people who have also been involved in law enforcement missions in the past, and some of them have been punished for their crimes.
He stressed that cooperation with Spain has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has come to our fore, and this week's operation shows the success of cooperation," said Prosecutor Verte.
Ago LIS, Head of the General Police Department, said that the arrests were preceded by a further investigation for the past six months and a half.
"The first half of the long-term work came to fruition and we held our suspicions in Estonia and in Spain," he said.
Lisa added that the police officers in Spain were helping with detention in Spain.
For years now, we have had a good relationship with the police and the civilian forces.
These detentions are yet another message to the idea that we will catch them from another Europe," said Lise.
The information collected so far shows that, while in existence, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the D.A. has requested that they be arrested and that the court approves them.
The arrested man is waiting for his surrender to Estonia.
In this case, goods, vehicles and cash are detained to ensure that they are seized.
Criminal proceedings shall be conducted by the Office for the Crimes of the Central Criminal Police and shall be requested by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The City Court of Tallinn sentenced Slava Gulevitch to execution in 2005 and sentenced him to five years in prison.
In the second half of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in the world of crime in Estonia, following the then world leader, Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch from Kemerovo rose in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began to deal with extortion in Tallinn.
It was claimed that he taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at hotels and charged businessmen monthly coverage fees.
The Joint Operations (JUs), the seizures of criminal offences and the agreements that have taken place confirm that this House is effective in the area of organised crime.
For example, the last rulings, the so-called "Dikayev Criminal Community" criminal prosecutions, which were confiscated at EUR 80 000, or the Court of Justice in respect of a person, that Igor Adeniika established in 2006 a criminal association aimed at the illicit trafficking of secret cigarettes and the criminal offence in human trafficking in East Ireland and South Estonia.
The amount of the frozen revenue is approximately EUR 71 500 there.
In these criminal matters, progress has been achieved by the daily exchange of information and evidence by prosecutors with foreign institutions and, if necessary, by any action in the European Union.
The Commonwealth of the Commonwealth is a complaint from the United Nations against travelling to Missouri.
The United Nations Organization for the Promotion of Selected People (NAACP) has warned against blackism and racist attacks by the United States of America.
The group statement states: "The NAAA travel note issued for the state of Missouri, which is valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be particularly alert and cautious when travelling around the state, taking into account a number of breeds of suspicious racial events that have recently taken place throughout the Republic and also outside the State."
In NAA, the group was encouraged by the recent Missouri Law to issue a travel warning, which makes it more difficult to win crimes concerning the appeals, as well as by the fact that the state’s public defenders’ targets are inequally largely minority.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They will be thrown in the way of their skins, beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, president of NAAP Missouri's branch, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so many complaints before."
This is the first such warning that the organisation issues per State of the United States of America.
The group referred to events such as racial interviews with black students under the direction of Missouri University and the 28-year-old Tory Sanders in Tennessee.
At the end of this year, he was in a suspicious situation after he got hit by gas while driving through the state, and Missouri's police arrested him without being accused of being charged with a crime.
Furthermore, the observation indicates a recent report by the Prosecutor General of Missouri, indicating that in the state, vehicles of the black car are likely to be stopped by 75% more likely than those of the Russians.
"The point is that people know and warn their families, friends and workmates about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared, that is to say, to receive bail money or to inform their relatives that they are passing through the state."
On the basis of the most recent data from the FTL report program, 100 offences were recorded in Missouri in 2015, which shows that the number of countries that would cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border cross-border transactions in Finland was estimated at 100.
Traveliatus also responds to Missouri's new law that makes it difficult for the company to appeal to the court or to seek employment for absolution.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union ACLU) had previously issued travel notes for Liechtenstein and Arizona after the adoption by those States of immigration laws which called on local authorities to arrest people for the consequences of immigration, as ACLU states that this increases racial profiling.
Travel alerts are issued for foreign countries, but recent interests are beginning to use this measure as a response to certain laws and regulations in the United States.
Hepatitis: What should anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis may be caused by hepatitis A, B, C, D and E.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, hepatitis B and C have a serious effect, which may be associated with liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
The Agency’s epidemiological advice Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis as for all types of hepatitis of the liver, such as fever, burning, loss of appetite, loss of appetite, vomiting, currency, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last symptom also stems from a common name for liver inflammation.
In patients, hepatitis may be associated with no symptoms.
The different types of inflammation can only be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
A non-hepatitis may be converted to chronic hepatitis and have been going for decades without any symptoms, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her risk of liver disease.
The Moon Kutsar will reveal and describe the different hepatites and will describe their progress in a more detailed manner.
A hepatitis virus spreads from a large number of people and infects us when eating or drinking contaminated food or water, by sex, from infested people’s stools to hands and hands to food, to bodies, to objects, to mouth, and to the consumption of drugs.
The risk or risk group for hepatitis A is composed of the affected family members and carers, persons with chronic drug disease, people who have an infection, people who have sex with men, people who have sex with men, people who have a heart attack, people who have a high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infection can be prevented in vaccinations, in particular, vaccination is recommended for many travelers and persons at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to fulfil daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruits and vegetables before eating for food.
The hepatitis B viruses spread in contact with human blood, injection of gums, tattooing, shooting, use of contaminated human males (tooths, shaves), donor blood, sex with a person of the hemorrhoid suspect, and from the mother to the foetus/infant.
The risk group for hepatitis infection includes injecting narcotics, infected human sex partners, male dating husbands, newborns of an infected mother, sick hosts and carers, health care, rescue workers and migrants in contact with blood and other body parts, and travelers visiting countries with a high disability of hepatitis B.
In order to prevent hepatitis B, it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate children at risk and, in addition, persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetics.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: the avoidance of the use, tattooing and disposal of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other appliances and injection needles, and the use of condoms in the event of infectious sex or the prevention of sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national vaccination plan in Estonia and is free of charge for children.
The hepatitis C virus spreads from the effects of exposure to human blood, injection of gums, tattooing, shooting, use of blood-borne male males, donor blood, having sex with a hepatitis suspect, and from a mother to a mother/responsible for the hepatitis.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting narcotics, infected human sex partners, male dating mothers, newborns of an infected mother, sick hosts and carers, blood and other body-to-body health care, rescue workers and migrants, people with HIV infection, and visitors to countries with highly ill C hepatitis.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: refrain from using, tattooing and spraying foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other appliances and injection needles, and to use condoms in case of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which is different from hepatitis B virus in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection is present in combination with hepatitis B or as an anti-inflammation in chronic hepatitis B patients.
The hepatitis D virus spreads on the face and other body fluids, with contaminated injection needles, sexually and infrequently from the infected mother to the foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is the chronic hepatitis B vaccine and the non-anti-hepatitis B agent.
Effective prevention is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people from infection with hepatitis D virus.
The viruses of this hepatitis are transmitted on an oral basis with water and food, including infrequently cooked meat, fish and seafood, blood from the donor, drinks from the public and milk from the infected mother.
The survivors may be infected by E hepatitis in countries with a high level of disease.
The prevention measures for hepatitis E are to meet the hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect the hands after going to the toilet, before preparing and eating, after being ill.
Fruit and vegetables should be washed before meals, should not be used to eat some meat, fish and seafood, drink only healthy drinks and avoid drinking drinks.
On the other hand, the competitions tried to get off the track the four-time Olympic winner, the 34-year-old Farah found power at the top, and won in time.
Farah did not long, pulling along with his wife and children after the finish.
This was a special moment for me.
I care about my family. I care about my family.
Being on the track was amazing," Farah said to the journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title tournament in London at a total of 5,000 and 10,000 meters of gold doubles.
Anything can be done if you believe that.
Despite the title, Anne-Bie O'Connor's "Daam in gold. Gustav Klati's dallire, Ale Bloch-Bauer's special story" is much more precious than the story of the birth of a work of art in the 19th and 20th of Vienna.
Even more in time.
An awesome amount of information would have cost you a lot more than a cut-off axe, a cloudy theme in the title of the shoot-off would have led to a greater impact on the exceptional story of the press.
At present, it would be as if there were two books in one cover: the story of Gustav Klumt and Adele Bloch-Bauer, pictured in the "Dam in gold" on his watch, and a much more spacious and comprehensive history of respected Jewish families and the German occupation, with its consequences in Austria.
The first leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle, and who has fallen into the capital of Austria, to imagine how more than a hundred years ago life went into the Ringstras, or how everything was turned around in the Central Café when Klimt entered.
The concentration of the gypsies was in one of Europe's poorest cities, and when you see a name in the book, you feel like you know each other more culturally.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was in a city where he was in a penitentiary penitentiary and was Europe's highest level of suicide, is as if nothing was going on with development.
Or perhaps - every single word of a pint will add colors to cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
The Union for the Migration of the Soviet Union
In the first few centuries of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown rapidly, turning into the largest Soviet community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the century, almost one in five people living in Vienna were Jewish.
Adele was a newcomer in Vienna, but by the time Adele married twice the older sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed Klumt for his famous evenings, her father had already become the first bank in the Habsburg Empire.
However, the entire life in which he belonged did not draw any attention.
When you look at "Daami in gold," it's hard to believe that halfway to life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
For the 1903s, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order from Klimt his husband, there was a moment in Vienna for the hottest presenter.
At the time, Klimt's order cost 4,000 SEK, a quarter of the value of the farm with a fixed estate.
The fact that, in any case, the Master's Love Story model was suspected of being the model, it did not injure the sweets.
As far as a matter of fact is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist in the course of the work continued for life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Dam, baby.
Gustav Klit Master's thesis, Adele Bloch-Bauer's special story", Varrak 2016, translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Immediately before the work with Adele began, Klimt was going to Ravennas San Vitale's Basilica, and the researchers believe that just what they saw was the glamorous shrines of Empress Theodoras that gave the artist the idea of making the golden pot of Adelle as a mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Daami in gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at the same time (in 1907-1908) another golden country was born in "Suudus".
There were no two similarities among art historians.
Is there any connection to the nature of the disease?
"I think I owe my friend Klimt a debt to him to make his handiwork available to the public", writes Adele Bloch-Bauer a few years after leaving the art (Klimt in February 1918) to the Director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family's Klimt Assembly would send to the museum.
A month ago, Klim had completed another show on Adele.
In his will (Adele left in February) he asked him to leave two portraits and four Gustav Klimt in the countryside of Austria.
His mother-in-law gave her nieces Mary and Luis.
After Klimt had completed the "Austrian Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but he failed to describe it.
In some cases, the fact that Jewish professors did not accept him to the Academy is sometimes considered to be the reason for the Polish socialism, in fact, none of his examiners were Jewish.
The task of Mary’s will in Austria had changed markedly by 1939 - it had become important to find good works in the rich Jewish libraries of Vienna for the Nazi Party.
Some of Adele's work was also suitable for a work in the household, but not Klimt's.
Six months after the Nazi robbery, a ten-year trial took place between the Austrian Government and the owners of Bloch-Bauerte.
All we have to say here is that if "Sududus" is seen in the Castle of Belvedere in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Barer is to be seen in the "Dami gold" of New York Neue Galerie.
And before driving to Vienna, the above book will also be used.
Even if you don't want to go to Klimt's job, because at least my emotions went around more Nazi and Jewish than a million dollars worth of painting and stuff about Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So it's not as bad as the family's fate, and it's a very touching story.
Significantly, the family family family of guerrillas made it easier to focus on events at the beginning of the book.
The 17-year-old swimmer in Canada was very close to Estonian record in Canada.
Gold was very close to the personal record of 200 m of swimming in his life as he swims very close to 2.16,62.
Tippmark dates back to 17 years from the time of 2.16,58, when Canada won the Young Masters Championships, Priit will mediate the Aquarium.
Golds as the last, or 10th A-final.
In the finals, he passed the distance of 2.15, and reached the second place with a new powerful top mark.
Of the Estonian record belonging to Alina Kendzior (2.15,13), a little bit more than half of Gold's withdrawal was made.
In Estonia's ever-time series, Gold has gone up, and his latest peak is Estonia's fifth result for all time.
Unhindered hope is still at the start of 100 m, 200 m and 400 m for the Canadian adult championships, and 200 m and 400 m for the swimming.
Last week was held in Toronto at the Canadian Junior Championships and Gold also played tickets there.
He won 200 m free-driving with the time of 2.03.22.
This was the first time that this distance was used for the last time in 2008 in Estonia.
Throughout the past years, only the Estonian recordman Elina Parkõka has been able to benefit from this distance in Estonia.
In Canada, a healthy Estonian could still win a bronze medal 100 m off-set with an excellent record and a new Estonian season top mark 56.66.
A year older, Kerttu Ly Alek has only been involved for one century.
Up to the end of the personal hiatus, he still spent 100 m reading an open message in the wake of the call for proposals on 1st March,69.
At half the distance, he only made it to the second place when he was swimming in the finals.
Gold is currently leading Estonia's season of ed information in four different styles.
The drum is going to go down, the critiques are going to evaporate.
The time of the sitting is now - it also means relaxation for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
As long as Trump has been one of the presidents of the most recent days, the criteria are already different.
According to today and CNN, the president is planning a 17-day vacation to spend at his own golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
The President's leave began yesterday, and Trump's opponent has already spoken his vote for a week.
They give Trump too much rest.
It is the president’s custom to spend the weekend in his own homes in Florida, Virginia and New Zealand.
Besides, Trump has not changed the most in his new day's office.
For example, George W. Bush at this time to be 67 days, Barack Obama was half as much as Trump, just 21 days.
But Trump's stuff tends to be forgotten quickly.
Counted days after becoming the first one, Trump said in "60 minutes" that there would be no time left for a long vacation during his assistant's time, because much has to be done.
He expressed his disdain three years ago for the Warack Obama House.
The current president wrote on Twitter: "As Obama is on the phone, playing golf, going to the attics and jazz concerts, Daddy's journalist gets his head cut off."
There is no relaxation in the evening of the 17-day golf club, according to the public statement.
It's called a kind of job leave, in which I don't want to spend time or change my mind.
There must have been a job break.
Next, an air conditioner will be replaced in the Red House, and that is why the entire community had to leave the area.
Ovalabine and other office premises of the President are also present in the village.
"I don't think that one of the other guys is going to be in the western wing in the next month, if there's 38 degrees and he's not air-conditioned," said the spokesperson Lindsaywals, who stressed that the president will continue to work at the time.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll have a feeling about the video.
Exclusion of criteria from Facebook again apply to the State Office if you do not approve of the criticism of the voters.
Our country's father knew something about poor media coverage.
The American loved George Washington, but in the papers it didn't take long for him to get his ass kicked out of everything from internal politics to the principles of his religion.
Critics, of course, upset him.
But he did not force his Christians to remain silent.
In 17 C.E., Washington said that "the freedom of expression may be taken away from us and, in dark and quiet, we may be told, like sheep, to slaughter."
It's gonna bring me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, and he's gonna look like he's got a lot more to do.
The authorities of Hogan have blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts, who published their opinion on the official page of this magazine.
And this week, the U.S. Civil Society Association (A.I.C.) appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The governor's community said that the action was void and that the comments on the news were cubs in the counter-reaction style of "Who cares?".
"It's just Facebook,"
That's what matters.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is probably a popular Republican governor most often in the United States.
His approval is best in second place among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan's not a very responsive nipper.
He has led the state on a certain hand and remained firm on his principles.
In addition, he has been using Facebook as the main tool for communicating with his voters, for example, after the first time in the course of his/her education, he/she has given his/her bald head in a personal manner.
Thus, the Governor's newspaper is a public forum, which is officially marked, managed by the protection of people who want to earn money from the dollars, which is unnecessary and ultimately fatal.
In an interview given to The Washington Post, Mr. Hogan's pressman, Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behaviour, claiming that the rejection of comments was nothing but a moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of lively internet trolls, trash mail or get drunk.
The post talked to the real man Hogan was talking to.
And that's exactly what they are, a real person who works with his chosen leaders, a teacher, an owner and a pastor, not an Internet troll.
All they said was that their comments were respectful, thought-out, and not bad at all.
In his post, Pastor quoted the Bible by pressing Hogan’s cataclysm.
Lawyer Lakhm Harma Raman, from Maryland Bowie, did not hate, but for real hate crimes.
"I said to you that I was disappointed because he has not reacted to hate crimes or any other recent news," he wrote The Post's news story in the Republic of China.
"I also don't like the idea that when people say the same thing to many people, it's just that it's just something they don't want to do, but I think it's a lot of people's concern."
What the governor's community said to call "the run-up to spam" would be called "the other public support".
The Facebook-timer makes it easy to match messages, simply by making a comment or by deleting a review.
It's far more than the old days when the same thing had to be sent out so they would collect newspapers with critical manuscripts and burn them or arrest the protesters and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just learning.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for the bite of Facebook and other social media channels.
Trump has sued for information users who have closed the Twitter stream.
One of the first rulings in the full language on this matter was issued last week in Virginia.
U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Provinces of Loudoun broke the first amendment of the Constitution when he examined the voter's Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited Governor Matt Bevinit (R) after using ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
While in Washington, the postage stamp had a similar effect to that of the internet.
Between 1779 and 1800 p.m., his manner of guidance was stunned by the time of the period of time of time and by anonymous letter-mailers.
And even then, I'm gonna have to fuck you with an anonymous troll.
Some newspapers wrote letters under pseudonyms such as juriola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington decisions closed.
According to the historical documents collected in the framework of the online George Washington Letter Collection project, he buried himself under petitions that criticized his views on the agreement, trade and employment agreements with the United States.
He didn't make them keep quiet.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and debate are the beginnings of our country.

Ronan Rafferty allows Renaissance Square to stay at home for a while.
In the next three days, the former European front number Ronan Rafferty will give home-to-home service if the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf course of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The Northerner, who was in charge of the last round on the Archerfield Links tracks next year, before taking the oath to Paul Everes, is attached to the new event, and the role of the founder and CEO of the club in place of Jerry Sõvadi.

It was a very special time that we'll always stay in our heart."
Gary Orr, who joined the senior Europe tour in the end of the year when he received 50, will be back in competition on the inland side.

This is the first Dutch colony to be joined by Indonesia in 196, after the absence of a demonstration, which forced only 1026 old occupiers to vote in hand under the eyes of the occupiers.
The move to push for the surrender of the Dutch rule was quick towards Jakarta Government, which is still under strong control by keeping the foreign press and the human rights authorities out of control.
In 2006, the Republic was decommissioned to Papua and to Western Papua, so that the eastern part of the island was left to rest with Papua New Guinea.

Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of the people living below the poverty line and the mortality and illiteracy of babies are one of the worst in Asia.
But it is also an Indonesian country that is in a rush of land.
Just 100 km from Pania, which is a mountainous region of about 153 000 inhabitants, situated in the world's largest and most profitable gold mine Grasberg, which belongs to Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In fact, in 2015, Freeport here dug around 3.1 billion USD worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be threatened with consumer timber stocks, which are estimated to be USD 78 billion.
However, these disorders are a source of paternal suffering, as they require a powerful Indonesian king to suffocate.
A survey in The New York City revealed that Freeport paid some USD 20 million, including up to USD 150,000, to one officer, to one of the soldiers and units in the year from 1998 to 2004.

According to Phelim Kine, Vice-President of the Human Rights Watchi Department of the United States of America, Jokow's election promises to abolish the restrictions on reporting on transparency and development have not been implemented.
"In Indonesia, Papua from the easternmost troubled provinces and from the West Papua countries, the press are trying to make reports about the new challenges they face," he said.
The importance of the press’s look means that the pressure on the Indonesian Government is in contact with the immediate neighbours of Papua.

According to Gobai, the people of Spain, as well as the other popes, consider their vote to be a contribution to Jokowi, to which he must pay.
"They don't need money, they need truth," he.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the murder in Pania were still able to bury one body in the country of the police station and the military.

We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor," said a resident to Reuters who named himself George.
The firefighter fired the fire at about 4 o’clock at regular intervals (0 00 GMT) and set the house on fire.
The government said that they were suffering from asylum.
This incident may once again raise the question of the safety of high construction materials worldwide.
In the course of a fire investigation carried out by the Torchi Bureau in 2015, it was found that the most damage was caused by the fascade cover - external decorative panels and insulation.
The police have said that they believe that London’s Grenfell Tower isolation and façade systems could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that took place in June, which killed about 80 people.
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, see, that's a little bit of that.

There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is a widest and the other a longer-looking telephobic object.
At present, no one knows what the other two cameras are capable of, but it is definitely the first test in the second paragraph, which is certainly the same as the icon 8.
However, we are also waiting for 23 August.
Although Nokia has brought in three smartphones this year, at the head of Nokia 6, their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented on 16 August, is still not yet their flagship - Nokia 8, which will be presented on 16 August.
We look forward to Nokia 5,3 inches from the edge to the edge of the screen and the ultra-fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor and amazing battery.

For Sony's new model, it has been estimated that at least this screen is odd.
In fact, we can see right away, because first, Sony has announced his autumn flag at the International Technology Fair (IFA), which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.

However, the noise on the beach is common for her summer mayor.
"This weekend is a very good promo for our small town," says Harri, who is in the park.
Noise and noise haven't made his life go to waste either.

It doesn't bother me, though I live near here.

Convulsions in Kabul: a suicide attack in NATO was executed in NATO.
A suicide bomber, assisted by an ambulance, attacked the military forces in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital city, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
NATO's statement said that five soldiers and a translator were injured.
Unconvincedly, three people were also ousted in the incident in the Qarabaghi district of Qarabaghi.
This bombing is the last of the attacks that have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in the Herat Moscheer attack.
On the first day, a suicide bomber was shot in Kabul close to the Ichai embassy in Kabul.
NATO statement said that a Thursday night explosion occurred when the common patrol with the Afghan Army was attacked "with a man-made explosive".
It is said that everything is damaged in a stable condition and is being treated in a US military hospital on Bagrami's plane.
According to Correspondents, a group known as the so-called "ISIS" is an ever-growing source of concern for the forces of NATO Bagram in Qarabaghi.
In the first half of 2017, at least 1662 people have been killed in Afghanistan, around 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, the car bomb killed at least 30 million people in Kabul, mainly in the Shid District.

Epas abrogated after actions have been brought, a decision to defer the stay of the order has been taken.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) withdrew its decision to reject the adoption of the Obama-time regulation requiring States to limit the use of waste gases, one day after the 15 States appealed to the Court of Justice as a result of this change.
The EPA has announced its decision to continue "with the 2015 Ozone Determination Actions" at the very last, saying that this shows a commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe that we need to engage and listen to dialogue with our state partners," said Epa leader Scott Pruitt in the statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA’s intention to postpone the determinations of the ozone content by measuring the specific parts of the country’s mass sales in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the toughest air quality standard.
Fifteen main Democratic States, together with the Columbia District, filed an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
The President of the European Union, Donald Trum, has tried to withdraw one of the environmental regulations laid down by President Barack Obama, who, in truth, is part of a more comprehensive plan for economic growth.
But these attempts have been countering the effects of democracies and drugs on the lives of people who are concerned about the effects of pollutants on the environment.
The EPA website states that the inhalation of the air within the ozone "may alter the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of abate into respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
There may be talk on the English side.
In Germany and in the field, a lot can come of time, as heavy rains threaten the worst of the European Union, says Bloomberg.
This may be the case this year, for a few minutes before the harvest, it may mean that the bread can only be eaten.
"The quality of wheat is far more than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raicesen's analysis Bernhard USDa.
This year, up to 40 percent of the Germans can be used for animal feed, which is a double standard, in Agravi.
Germans, like their Europeans, have been in contact with any weather this year.
The winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which was replaced by the rainy rain in June.
In July, the Germans were struck by hundreds of wars that have been going on in August.
Many of the effects have been turned to northern Germany, where the rain prevents harvest.
So far, only five percent of the total has been harvested.
In no area has the harvest started yet, the local harvest buyer Cevavi has requested.
"It's been three days," said Ceravis' senior trader Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Compatible in everything or with the clever design of the Finnish interior design.
The beautiful scene plays its part in the interplay of the beesies, because through the large windows, Saimaa's skulls pass into many (life) rooms.
At each step, our northern neighbours will strive for both dirty and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
The use of Finnish public goods as building and finishing material, furniture and furnishings deserves to be admired and respected.
The builder and (home) designer find exciting ways and smart solutions in the fair houses.
It is evident from this that black, white and grey shades, if any, of these other elements and rooms, can be very pleasant.
Good ideas can be picked up for a while, because the fair lasts until 13 August.
Needs and odds suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
The night against today's line was drawn down to this year's Weekend World Baltic and Martin Garfield on the top of it all to remember the last performance.
The people were in a serious state of affairs during Garrix's performance - a joke, a fluke, dancing with a sense of self-evidentness.
When Garrix finished, a common crowd was spread across the coast of Pärnu as a crowd.
We'll bring you to a gallery with all the pictures that we've been trying to do on the weekend for the next few days.
Well, you're one of them, too, find yourself.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing the impact of the contrast.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Myy Garcia, who should be on a collision point to meet you at the most attractive boxing match in the near future up to 66,7 kg, met for the first Thursday.
They were in an ESPN cabin in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, an undefeated World Labouring Council heavyweight champion, walked across the hall to welcome the Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's capitalweight champion.
After the unanimous decision of Garcia to win the first four-time world champion Adria Broner on the third showtime, each of the fighters will be in the first instance of the table.
Garcia stretched her right hand and said, "How are you doing, champ?
I'll get it."
Lomahenko protects his belt against Miguel Marria at 19 a.m. last night at ESPN.
When some of the photos were posted, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, would point out that there would be a "perfect approach" between potential opponents.
"I'm the first weighty one," Garcia said.
"I'm moving up to Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm six-and-a-half kg of light.
I want to go below light weight.
And he must move upwards in light weight [62,2 kg], and then we can move.
Fans have called for this.
Let's just say it."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of poker is about this fight."
The climate raised the question of whether it should be a reward. It is part of his strategy to let Lomachen debut in the 61,2 kg class this year to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is interested in talking about the winner of the Jorge Linares and the Campbell champion after their presentation on the title round Forum.
"Looking at this could be valuable, because fans have called this up," Garcia said, later on, that she is open to any channel that offers the best help of the package.
"We're the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said that she thought Lomachenko was a "great fighter" and could go see her Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praise of Garcia, saying that he thought that the master of the three divisions from Riverside was "very slow; in other words, Mikey... you wanted it to be funny".
Garcia said that it was intended to show strength and then to fight.
The faiths assured them that they feel the way to cultivate a sense of violence between them.
"This is a struggle to be realised.
No other contradictions cause so much attention and everything.
I'm more than ready to do this," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is exactly that.
Come on, come on.
From which part of the world will they be moved to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Authority (PPA) issued a record of over 13,000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have traveled to Estonia for work, study or family.
For example, if it was decided last year to grant a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, how long ago it was 4928.
The agencies can't say how many immigrants are left in Estonia at the end, but such an examination will be held at the Internal Affairs Department.
Five years ago, when nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia each year, this number will reach 2,000 in the last year.
The number of applicants for a residence permit has risen sharply during the migration crisis - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, in the previous 6 people.
According to statistics, the number of citizens in Estonia is growing most in Estonia - in Estonia, there are 850 more than the number of people left.
"Some communities in Estonia have been great at all times, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is difficult to find work and learning opportunities in the country, where the community and the family are already ahead of them," said the minister of the house in Christianity.
For me and for a few years, the number of Ukrainians who had been granted temporary residence was higher than the number of Russian citizens, although for ten years, the total number of fixed-term residence permits issued to the latter has been higher than the total number of fixed-term residence permits issued to them.
If the Ukrainians come to the country in the vast majority of the time, it's because of Russia's family abuses.
"In view of the tragic Russian community here, it is most likely that there will be the most personal contacts with the people living in Russia," said Hina Maasing, a migration researcher at the National Defence Academy.
"Looking at where Estonian-occupied Russians have moved, there is right after Harjumaa," he added, and it turns out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year I received a permanent residence permit for 1696 Russian citizens, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the Russians who wished to extend their residence permit at the same time did.
"Hupe is due to the fact that instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been applied for," explained Rammus, Minister of the Interior's Press, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonia's residence permit has been more likely to survive for years.
A new residence permit can be requested here for at least a year from the previous year.
It's a move to make a move on people.
However, long-term residence permits require, for example, five years.
In the case of a new residence permit, it is likely that the extension of the old residence permit will also be possible.
Last year such a residence permit was granted to 146 students who have worked here for at least three years.
Now the students will be able to change their jobs, and the country of Estonia will no longer be able to trace whether the award criteria have been met.
This residence permit was doubtless popular - as applicants for the last time the holders of the hall passport (1029), the Russians (4*), the Indians (54) and the Nigerians (96).
A meeting took place in 1968, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and just as many Chinese people.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such producers is already 1269.
Ten years from now, it is said that Nigeeria has become a country that is one of the first applicants for a Estonian residence permit.
When three residence permits were issued in Nigeria in 2007, 200 was issued last year.
They're coming from Nigeria to study at this university.
Estonian colleges are also popular among, for example, Georgians, Chinese and Turks.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely thanks to studies.
These also apply the rule that where the community has been prepared, it has to be easy to change," added Ramus.
Over the past ten years, two people have moved to Estonia from North Korea, much from Laos and Lit.
Ten people are here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from South Korea.
If an annual residence permit is granted to some 6,000 third-country nationals, it is about 0.4% of the total population.
In addition to the citizen of the European Union, the migration is a half-percent," the Earthing said that there is actually a problem.
According to the statistics, 14 822 people emigrated to Estonia, out of here 13 792.
This means that immigration passed another year of emigration.
The majority of the people who come out and come in are Estonia, but more are those who leave the country.
The migration of Estonian citizens was reduced to 2,000 people last year.
Estonians travel between Finland and Estonia in particular.
Mama's Couture Princess Fashion attracts sats, tics, and fights.
The bottomless idea is, however, history for Maria Tammeru - old paintings and costumes: "I could dream a billion pieces of goods in the museum and admire modern sleeves and collars.
If you like, you'll give it a shot.
It's a joy to reveal yourself.
The global world of Mammu Couture may seem to be in some living strangers, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how great it is in your life.
I have a friend with a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses.
And it is not his fault that he does not live in Hollywood and does not go on every day on a bright carpet, he also wants to wear all the most beautiful dresses, and he does!
You can live your own life in a special way.
The fashion designer does not notice the difference between the shining events and the day of the day of the regime.
It was this thought that made it possible to move the artefacts into rural areas in Estonia, through forests and fields, to people, to whom fashion often does not reach.
Mammy's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion, where the 45-model Royal Deflee filled the street with a royal deficit.
In Estonia, often hanged, nodded with dignity, but elsewhere there are more emotions - cheering, rising up, trying to thank me hand in hand.
A large part of the audience came to be re-wrote, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be enthused.
And I like the feeling that I'm in my way of doing it, like I'm in my summer routine.
Pärnu was a 50-metre long red carpet, full of beautiful dresses all over the street, seemed like they were not going to end.
Furthermore, it does not seem to be fashionable that a great supermodel should be presented to the business, it will be a pleasure for women on stage.
Often I invite my own customers to the stage - they are always happy to come.
This is such a great experience, you can see it on the stage in a beautiful dress.
I'm so sorry that I'm never my own performance, I'm always sure I'm going to give you a soft spot for hopeless perfectionist things.
I don't want to look at it.
Maria is a kind of showkeeper who doesn't just want to play a part, but to be in all hands.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, I do some of the collections myself.
I love the whole thing where you play with details, find out.
I'm never away from my work, and I'm not afraid of my work.
The design does not concern, nor does the stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to blow up a day of temperament.
This feeling of work is still a big deal for a fanatic.
I can't even say when I'm at work, it's just a day for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant happiness: I'm doing something, something's going on, something's going on, some other compliments.
How many times has it been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The familiar satires that made Maria's talent famous all night have remained the signature of Mammu Couture until today.
Mytorse of the U 18 boys: the Estonians' sub-group tournament has now been replaced against us.
I'm out of music.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our hands on our table.
And if the cup is so different, nothing to do," said the Estonian U18 basketball team 61:75 below our NBA played basketball, BC Kalev/Cramo abiturator Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 shots on the attack table and got so many more attacks.
Nor were we prepared to defend them aggressively or attack, it created .
In a second or so, we couldn't resist the attack of many angels.
However, in their ability to defend themselves, they held hands everywhere, we couldn't afford to.
It knocked the leg down on the floor.
The answer to homework was a good thing.
In my opinion, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the counter-intelligence.
In the last quarter - we were wrong, but the opponents have already received more quick baskets.
Decentness and closeness, which was on the under-group tour, now turned against all of us.
We do not have the strength to resist this aggression.
The Myrrhage was at peace with its suspect in Kalevi, Matthias Bag.
In the tournament in general, good words can be said about the entire team, so far a single blowout has been established.
I'm sorry that you've met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup's been on its own all along, and she's been saying thank you, but it seemed like she was-- she's been carrying it.
But he did make some really good moves that I've seen in practice before," added the instructor.
Available numbers: In a few basketball pools, the EM tournament scored three-quarters less than 10 points...
In the U18 age class, not only did the EMI B division of the heroes go to the basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started last night in Dublin.
The Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, was a counterrecording event.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49 that, in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their feet off the gas market, and that was the sign 16:16.
As in the second quarter, Estonia had 4, 3 points 1 ...
In the first two minutes, the Estonians hit two of the first four hits, and then they missed twenty-five, then one in the third, and then another 21 in the second...
In almost half an hour, 47 visits were caught one.
came from point 2 of the four freebies.
The stake loss was in that time, 12.
At the end of the game, the Polish had a struggle of 33 and Estonia had 13 (68/9).
Estonia has begun with two ravages, and today Portugal had to open up 83:4 in order.
Sailors will ship to Tallinn to complete their supplies.
NATO's 1st annual session of NATO's 1st annual mission to Tallinn for the weekend of its scheduled port visit to fill in the warehouses and prepare for the next exercises.
During the visit, ships prepare for their return to the sea and give crew members the opportunity for a few days' stay.
Later on, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to conduct a series of events and be ready for the next period of search for historical explosive devices.
"The participation of the Estonians in the NATO unit and their cooperation in the local waters is a good expression of our integration with the Allied Forces," said Major Arto Reinmaa, Head of Operations and Operations of the Navy Fleet Commission, Head of the General Assembly of the Navy.
On 29 June, NATO will lead the 1st branch of the NATO military group, Lieutenant General Gvio Laudeps of Latvia, who took over the responsibilities of the Assembly at the ceremony in Riga from the Estonian Navy Officer, Lieutenant Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The group's flag is a Latvian Navy support vessel in LVNS Virseit, which also operates a command post.
During that year, the international entity is also part of the Estonian Navy miner Sakala.
One of the four sub-groups of vessels under the command of the NATO Navy is that of the primary rapid responders of the NATO 1st Division, which may be sent to different parts of the world within a day.
4. - On 13 August, the Pirita monastery will once again return to its former place where it will be shot 13 years ago by the Maestro Eri K.
This evening's Brigitta Festival will be the beautiful, powerful and unprecedented name of the artistic leader of Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Josti (36).
Risto Jóst: The audiences of the world class include "Tarviata" and "Tosca", the ballet performances of the charming "Bellost" fun "Karlssonini", and there is also no planned self-assessment, which in this case represents the same international community as the "Years" of Joseph Haydn's wonderful oratheory, which in 2015 will set up Haydn's second series "Loomine".
The Tagitta Festival is far more than just concerts and theatre performances.
This is greater than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a place where the spell takes power and never ceases to exist.
The presence that a listener can have in this high and mysterious environment makes the world's world sound and speaks of human minds that can't be perceived.
Risto, for the first year, you are the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival.
Didn't the maestro Special Glass shoes look a little big?
No, but since I had a really good time with Erkla, it's been a lot of help.
He directed me through my entire academic career and also supported me at the beginning of my career as a conductor.
Maybe it's just that it's easier for me to go to work.
In the special class, there has been so much good news about the death of the Birgitta Festival, and I am going to carry it all over to me, too.
It was time to join the crew, who knows how to deal with it.
It was just a special big heart that gave me the strength to move forward with the Brigitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I'm on it.
What can be done to stimulate the audience at the fund this year, what can you offer?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and as a public talker, by the way, the first ball written to the talk of Astrid Lindgren is to be presented.
It's "Karlsson".
And one of the criminal nuances about it is that the author of this ballet is Yuris Karlsons, the composer of Latvia, who expressed his wish to write this work.
He's had the character of Karls since he was a kid.
Risto, how do you know all this?
For my supportive life partner, I'm sure.
Good work is a system of support and a lot of love, and I'm lucky for it.
And I have noticed that my personal emotions do not matter as much as anyone else as I do how I respond to every day of my life.
And such a conscious keeping of the tone, keeping the crucifixion and, in fact, smiling at myself in the morning's mirrors, seriously added my hand to my hand.
Now, on this occasion, when the most important example is, I've done this especially in practice, and it works.
This laughter acts as an activator of the brain and generates results.
That's not a word for it.
I guess people don't know half the things about their bodies that the universe does, but they're gonna open it up.
Right now, it's urgent.
Do you have any ritual before you enter the conductor's remote?
Sure, you have to change your clothes for the better.
This is just a moment for yourself.
Yeah, well, I don't have much time to rest or a little sleep.
I even like to have fun with people, even before I step into the conductor's desk.
But all of you come to the Brigitta Festival, here's something to be revealed to, not to a very large opera and ballet friend.
Have a pleasant video with Risto Institu!
The new results of the Swedish tests for the assessment of the age of Swedish assilators were published.
In Sweden, a test was carried out to assess their age with a new approach to medicine. The most recent results of the test show that more than 80 per cent of the test subjects were evaluated for more than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Judicial Medicine (Rätsmedinalverket) started the tests at the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for the assessment of age in the course of the asyl application after the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticised for not being able to correct the age of many alleged minors.
At present, 6880 cases have been sent to the study by Migrationsverket and the Institute of Justice has issued a total of 24°C test results between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eight per cent (fluoro) were estimated to be 18 years old or older and, in 25 other cases, the Institute of Medicine assessed that the test "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that people are "presumably less than 18".
The test shall be carried out only if the age of the person is below the mark.
The results of the previous months are those of Johan Göranssä, who worked in the Jubilee Institute.
"We don't see a big difference with the last month," he said to The Local.
The fact that most cases were assessed as less than 8, does not necessarily mean that asyl applicants have lost their age.
The Institute issued the results of the 5 2008 test in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the test substance is 18 years of age or older".
If the Svenska Dagbladde newspaper examined the results of these 581 tests, it seemed that 243 cases had completely been said that this year will be 18.
This medical old-age evaluation method, which involves wiser X-rays and an MRT of the knee, after which they are allowed to be analysed by vets and radiologists, has been criticised in some districts.
One of the instruments is Claude Marcus, an endographer at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include evaluating human health skills to find out whether they passed the puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I've had a lot of time to think about it, and I don't think I should use it now.
In this way, the determination of biologic age is very uncertain.
If we can't say we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson from the Institute of Judicial Medicine protected the accuracy of the tests: "Of course, it can be said that the child's risk of inaccuracy is small.
The most often at about 10% is when a person is a little less than 18."

A 20-year-old hammer rocketer, Anna Maria Orel, made London's MMil-like debut, getting to 67.37ga on 18th place.
Orel was M.M.'s youngest sniper, and the Minister-in-law confirmed that he was hoping to win the medals in the future.
The fight went well and I got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately took away my average result, second (62.80) I gained too much money and I managed to keep my head clear on the third (irc.)", says Rel after the competition.
I was looking for my iide, and I'm glad I found it.
The spell of Maria Maria Oreli MM ended in 18 places.
The rain didn't interfere with the Orel, because he's training winter through the U.S. Stadium.
"I'm scratched," he said to the little mutt.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel sense people around him, or was he able to shut himself out?
I get it, but I definitely do.
Everyone says it's going to happen - that's it.
If you compete, it'll hurt.
The Orel said, "I came here this season with the 32th result, I finished at 18th."
This is a very good conclusion.
I'm 20 years old and MMil-- that's what matters.
I'm gonna take a good look, and someday I'm gonna have to compete for the medallion.
Governor-in-Office of the Council
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice will meet with President Trump on Thursday night to exchange parties.
"Whether it is or not, the Democrats went away from me," says Governor Justice.
"Thank you, I tell you, after praying and asking you... I thank you, you people of the West of Virginia, that I cannot help you as governor any more."
At the meeting, joys were created.
"This is going to be a Republican Republican," said Justice.
"As a trainer, I would say to you that time is another game."
Trump had previously promised a great announcement at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is a single billionaire of the state, was found in 2016.
Forbes states that he owns coal mines in five states and he owns coal mines from his father.
The value is about 1, billion dollars.
At the same time, the Committee of the Republics (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the change of Governor Justice's party is another blow to the parties, which would otherwise change the state better than to work for it".
"All 15 governors and the control of the highest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the most recent statement to parties that are out of control and unable to find an answer and a connecting message," said President Ronna McDaniel, who said to CBS News.
I don't know if there's a lot of people, but there's a lot of injured people.
Urmet, a member of the weekly medical tent, tells him yesterday evening that they had to distribute a lot of patches.
The epochs and epochs are fundamental, epoxy, and soft.
Also include head, back and foot currencies.
According to Urmet, visitors will come to the Foundation with a false foothold and that's how it works.
The doctors have also had to assist more injured visitors - there have been some panic attacks and also one leg fracture.
We have also done our homework when a person has broken his hand or finger.
Let's do some work here, let's send more to the hospital.
Check the video to see if any of the medics are asking for a painkiller from the medics.
Coe Russian honest language for the Doping Candal
A lightness of one's nostrils, Sebastian Coe, in his words, says "Russian Thursday's honest language" after the doping candida, but repeated that it is not time to allow the country back to sport at this time.
Russia's light-headed noser Dmitry Shylahtin said to the IAAF Office on the night before the world championships that the ban imposed on his state is right and he is determined to fight doping.
He pleads "for all the light-evils who have been picked up by gold and silver medals in the contest."
In response to his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the prohibition of competition established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Training Agency (WADA) report shows evidence of state-supported doping in the Field.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the journalists.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation also admitted by itself that they had been in a hurry and that they were doing everything possible to renegotiate the alliance."
According to Coe, he was pleased that the Union agreed to re-establish itself.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is being made, but the Congress supports the proposal that it is not the right time to turn back," Coe said.
"We must do everything in our power to normalise the situation in the next few months.
It has certainly been the principle that we want to separate the pure athletes from the corrupt system," he said.
Nine Russianlighters, who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete as absolute athletes at the world championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Chairman of the IAAF Group, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet many of the incentive criteria.
After a report to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping checks have still been insufficient and that trainers have still been banned.
The revolution in the cars is a major change in the demand for metals.
Are the winners and the boyfriends?
The fact that the electric car revolution is turning from the fuel market to the gas market also creates winners and losers on the metal market.
Although miners like Glence can say that they will win and take from one place, smaller mining companies will not be helped.
Glencore is now producing coal and oil, but in the future, electric cars will grow in the age of cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel.
In 2006, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom have made contributions in respect of the use of motor vehicles, which will allow the sale of new cars for the use of fuel fuel in the coming years to be banned.
Since then, Volvo has already known that they are going to give up the internal combustion engine and Tesla will market a cheaper Model 3 electric car.
It is estimated that over the past two years, more cars using fuel will be sold than cars using oil.
"For some metals, it all changes," said Capital Yummi, a meta-analysis to Simona Gambrinini Bloomberg.
We already have a lot of effects on metals such as caves and fusion, which have grown for many years.
There's about three times as much copper in the cars as there is in the car, Glen.
There is even more copper in the loading stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that this will increase the demand for copper by about five per cent for 2025.
The increase in the demand for batteries in motor vehicles means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glenco is becoming the world's largest cobalt producer, predicted by Jefferies Ltd., from the rising trend in electric cars' revenues from the copper price increase.
This broker estimates that the other winners of electric cars are Freeport-McMORan and First Quantum Minerals.
The pressure is already reacting to a changing trend.
This year, 70 of the Six Metal Exchanges have been expensive.
Last year's rise was 37.
Copper has also been priced by 14 percent this year, mainly because of economic growth.
Glencore's share rose by 20 percent in London, having reached Rio Tinto Beach, BHP Billiton and Anglo America on the rise.
On the producer side, there are companies such as Recyclex and Campine that need to change in the new era.
Lead’s main end-use is electric batteries for starters for petrol and diesel cars.
Cars use lithium housings.
"This is a serious risk to demand, except if it is considered to be of any other use that could change the change", said Michael Widmer, the judge of the Lynk market for metals in the Bank of America.
The impact of the rolling trend on the price movement of lead is not yet visible.
Lead is 17 per cent expensive this year, which is the best metal in London for basic metals at a price increase.
The earth’s earth’s dusty metal is now being used as a metal for a long time.
"I'm not sure it's that bad for service, because cheap oil keeps normal cars in competition," says Herwig Schmidt, the sales manager of Triland Metals, a metal broker company.
If demand falls, it will be slow.
Maybe it'll be like this in a year or so.
However, tougher exhaust standards mean that the demand for hybrids is increasing, which, when engines are started frequently, is made up of a solid fuel battery, an first and a third research body.
Light metals as if to replace the bed, since the lighter car can drive away with less electricity.
Of course, this is already an additional 1.6 million tonnes in the year 2013-2016.
This consists of 2.7 parts of the world’s total revenue.
This trend is likely to worsen, said Widmer.
Aluminum has cost 13 this year, as increasing demand for car manufacturers has led to market deficits.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with the General Motors to use research to produce amazingly light car components.
KalelorMittal and Tata Steel are trying to develop a lighter alloy of steel to resist the metal.
"The exciting steel should be for this development," said Exane BNP Pabias analyst Sylvain Brune.
There is a number of successes in the course of progress.
The end of the oil age can also lead to suffering on the plate.
I spent about half of this precious metal as a catalyst for diesel cars, metal cutter Johnson Matthey.
"There may not be a great demand in many of the currently high-nosed raw materials such as oil and platinum in the future," said the Natixis raw material analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that the raw materials are becoming less important, but their importance has changed over a period of 15 years.
Plastic manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
In the 20th century, the head of Uncore, Dr. Grynberg, said that more and more trucks were still being sold out of full-loaded cars.
In the 10 years term, the great hope of the platinum engine and the Hyundai Motos are developed on hydrogen-based cars that are switching from the plastic to produce liquid electricity.
In the meantime, it is not in fact the law.
"But it looks like it's a dead end by the way to the electric cars," said Exane BNP from Pabias to Brune.
In July, German car manufacturers got a lot of backing back because Stuttgart's court ordered the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How and how financial regulation affects Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unprecedented spending of European football clubs do not prevent the transition from the world record of Neymár to the Paris-Saint Germain Club in Barcelona.
Any event from UEFA, the governing body, which governs the European game and has the power to prohibit officers from participating in the prestigious League of Champions, is awaiting Paris Saint-Germain.
The UEFA's financial rules for fair play in 2011 (FFP) mean that PSG must at any time prove that Neymari's transition was financed without any ambiguity.
The bank was paid EUR 222 million (2 million) for the sole purpose of buying the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary must be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymama France's transition to the market.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to fund a lot of money for recruiting Neymar and adding Neymar to its high-speed order, given that the team is funded by the government of the United States of America.
Clubs have a lot of money to spend to recruit them, but they have to adjust it with legal incomes that allow them to get out of the game.
FFP was founded by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This other player believed that the clubs that were successful in searching for large debts were actually dealing with fraud and risk storage if banks or owners were to give up support.
Since 2011 FFP has been focusing on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in Chelsea's - buy a club with a pot and then make a lot of expenses to improve the search and to make a pottery - is easier to implement.
For the current three-year assessment period of FFP up to 2018, losses of up to EUR 30 million may be credited.
And despite the fact that Platin was deported from the Presidential Office in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Cefer is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not real and we will undoubtedly continue to establish these rules," said the last week The Associated Pressile Andrea Traverso, who is a FFP overseer at UEFA.
Although the PSG paid Neymar for a purchase clause in the form of a single total grant, it is possible for them to subdivide it for the whole duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, so it is possible to fix the change in the amount of EUR 44,4 million over the next five years.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, received the most serious sanctions against the city of Abu Dhab.
A fine of EUR 60 million (at present USD 82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was subsequently amended to EUR 20 million, and the club was asked to wait for the Masters' League to hit 21 players in 2014-2014 instead of 25 instead.
UEFA is looking for clubs that may try to plan over regulatory financial institutions by invoking their income through the owner-related company.
The Kastar enterprise may sponsor the PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to be above the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be counted as a full income.
As early as this year, when UEFA decided that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support had been blown up, the value of Qatar Tourism’s Authority PSG support had been inflated.
It has been reported that some part of Neymar's PSG service may come from the Catalogue through the distribution of the 2022 World Cups.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymar could become a member of the world's championships and claim that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a manoeuvring authority.
The penalties previously imposed on PG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the UEFA.
On Thursday, a number of speakers said that UEFA has not spoken to PSG before the Neymari transition with Neymari.
They spoke to The  USd Press on condition that they are guaranteed anonymity, as they are not allowed to discuss the PG situation.
The latest estimates show that PSG earned more than EUR 52.4 million in value in the 2015 - season period.
Data on the latest financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good impact on sponsorship transactions, trade and shirt sales.
A group is expected to have a minimum of 30 volumes in relation to the contract.
It was too, clearly agitated by the departure of one of the largest football characters, that Neymari tried to stop the transition, claiming that PG would destroy FFP.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the country," said President of La League Javier Tebas of Spain to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that P.S.G. belongs to Katar in its own right.
Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the United States Trade Council, shares La Liga’s view that the country is financing the club.
"It is the consequence of property rights, and it has completely changed the whole and the rest of the world over the last 15 years," Wenga said on Thursday.
"When a club belongs to a country, everything is possible.
It is difficult to respect the financial position of an honest game, since the state may have other ways or other interests to represent such a large country."
The Norwegian low-cost airline, Norwegian, has good reason to place on the plane pictures of those who have shifted their territory and have been involved in other activities, writes trip.ee
Along with the enlargement of the Norwegian working language, people have also found their way into the field of competition.
Among the selected individuals, there are e.g. Franklin, Greta Garbo (on photo) and Miguel de Cervanes.
In the near future, however, one of Queen’s legendary singer Freddie Mercury will be adornding one of the birds.
50 years ago: a hurricane storm in Estonia, tearing up roofs and windows from houses.
A hurricane called the Storm of the century, which on 6 and 7 August caused major damage, especially to the Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In Northwest Estonia, the speed of the days was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one tree to another in the garden and tried to support him with his hands.
Everything was dark and in the ring, like the end of the world.
Tamal already threw roofs from the houses, told Linda Kurova Haapsalust of 2002 in an interview she had given to the Estonian Parliament.
Linda's husband saw her own planted garden collapse.
But what are you gonna do with your hands, you're gonna get some kind of storm?
The sea went down, from the window to the injection into the water," said Mrs. Linda toina on Haapsalu Island Street.
The fact that you were full of trees and the roof of the railway station had flown 20-30 metres away, just like the next morning, you saw Linda as a haapsalu.
In fact, at the back of Paralepa, the tree was created in the earth, completely down, in part.
Everything looks great, the storm went through all the trees with a rag and a prune.
Lääne-Virumaa was not able to suffer very badly in August 1967 compared to Western Estonia, but the damage was great, written in 2007 by the Virumaa Journal.
Hasalu Lossipark and Padise park were swept away from the earth, but also our stalemates could suffer hard.
In Tallinn, the wind speed of up to 35 metres per second was estimated at about 130 kilometers per hour.
In Tallinn, Tallinn, at the Seafield, on the evening of August 6th, a little girl called "Mom, Mom,"
Chickens are in the air and can no longer get down!", signed by the Virumaa Journal.
The house of the Põlli Manor in the agricultural land was destroyed during the storm so that it was decided later to decompress.
In August, the Turks couldn't stand the skiddles that they didn't put up with at any later.
On August 12, 1966, the magazine broke down the search for towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches slowly, and the number of young people who work for the harvest went down.
In the storm, there were also crops, and the newspaper said that "partisan organizations must be both advocacy and advocacy and advocacy in the field of cereals".
The hurricane can be discussed if the mean current exceeds 32,7 m/s.
The rest of the world in Estonia from 2 November 196, when Ruhn was measured at a speed of 48 m/s, has been maintained for a period of 48 years.
Only on the island of Loon died in the instrumentation, so the wind speed measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean floor areas: nights of harvesting work and poor walking conditions.
The colder summer worlds also mean a smaller harvest in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"If it isn't, then the people are in the beach, and if it isn't, there's no people," the Beach Cleaner knows.
In the northern part of the city of Tromom, the kayaks are screaming.
These are the melodical cars of low-velocity vehicles, which trap the stripes on the patch.
In fact, the last of the seven inches of sand is snooping through it, picking out the mermaid and left behind the people: some heights, cigarettes and more.
Some people come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a good weather, then people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, Director of the Department of the Haaberst Society.
It's 6.30 p.m. and there's a nice harvest on the beach, which means it's got to be okay at 8:00.
Usov is already on duty at 4:00 a.m.
In addition, he will keep an eye on the beach of Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and the island of Paljasari.
The amount of waste waste has been reduced.
Years ago, it was much more than that.
They can now assess what is good for them", says Usov, who has been harvesting the property for 15 years.
Well, if something went wrong, so did it.
Now what's in it.
Pure land
One of the biggest jobs on Estonia's shores is the harvesting of seaweed or adro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-dro-d
For example, on the beach, it's going to have to be delivered to 400 000 tonnes for the beach season.
"It's an incredible amount," said Usov.
The second is domestic waste, perhaps everything that people kill.
There are eight large containers on the double-kilometre edge of the Stram, which need to be emptied three times a week.
That's a lot of work.
The colder summer weather has meant that there is a fifth less than that.
The third category is foregone goods.
In most cases, these are children.
As a result of this once-in-a-life, Usov has taken out a family of model cars from the inside of the sand.
These owners are waiting for a beach route to the wood road.
"Like it's gonna work out a lot more, but it's a catch." Uso already knows that he's gonna find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and have toys to re-install them into the sand.
The waste will be scattered out.
Erika Scholler, a representative of the Habersti Administrative Department, admits that the tractor's screening work is being done by locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to morning, disturbs the sleep of the people living in the neighborhood.
It's a job.
In one six, you have to go through twice.
"If we do not do so, the city will fine us," Schler says.
However, as with Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the aim is also to get Stromom's international mark for blue peacock.
"In comparison with Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained", says Scholler.
We've got more fish and rocks and harder to screen for sand.
But there's less on our shores than in the rest of the world.
Having heard of the talk of the dead on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of the strom, is bound to enter the conversation circle of a journalist and a harvester, highlighting the current loopholes of the beach.
The show's all over the place.
The problem is with birds and hunters who have pulled the trash," reports Martin.
It may be difficult to assume that man is able to change his behaviour so far, then Martin hopes that the government will do something with the trash and will, for example, give him cover on to prevent at least birds from going through it.
In fact, Martin is still satisfied with the development of the strom.
It seems that the city will take care of it.
It's a lot more comfortable with the fields, lit and freshly asphalted teas.
It was never the case that only one ride was allowed on the roller shot," says Martin.
Araquet cells in armodes: coin, just a coin.
For some period of time, it is necessary to take advantage of 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasurer, is looking for a drug with a metal detector.
I don't think today's gonna be worth anything either.
The sea gods are not just the benevolent ones for this.
"It's been a year and there's nothing worth finding right now," Dmitri says.
Dmitri's treasure bag has some euro coins, a cave and also dangerous nails that will then be shipped later.
It's a coin.
"No gold, no rings or anything like that," notes the mischief.
The bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%.
Bank of England is expected to report that the interest rates remain at the first level, as inefficiencies in economic growth and inflation have been reversed by fluctuations in terms of growth.
In of England has warned that economic growth will continue to exist, as household-tractive incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The policy-makers of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members are calling for a boost because the slow growth has weakened support for the recovery.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank has dropped its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% in 2018 and has warned that pressure on households' incomes remains, as inflation is expected to rise by 3% in autumn.
On the other hand, the Bank also indicated that the increase in the rates would be necessary to contain the inflation caused by Brexit over the next two years, and that there might be a need for an increase in credit costs higher than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the economic mammoth package launched a year ago following Buxit.
In February, it will conclude a fixed-term financing scheme that will provide banks with cheap finance, although it said that now, within this scheme, a further 15 billion quid is expected to be bids of GBP 1 500 billion.
In the Protocols to the Decision, the Bank states: "In the mid-point estimate of the MPC, the GDP (SKP) will not be in force in the near future, as the difficult situation of real income for households will also have an impact on future performance."
With regard to the determinations, it was reiterated that to correct inflation, it is necessary to "a certain strain on monetary policy" and to "a little more" if the markets are to be desired.
The stock exchange is currently in the first year of the second quarter of next year and the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second
The Panel stressed that all jumps are gradual and limited.
Decreased growth forecasts for this year and for the following year are comparable to the forecasts for the month of April of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1,8 % in 2018 remained stable.
After that news, the pound fell to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1, '%1 'and 0.4% to EUR 1,11.
The fact that no change is made is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have silenced the hope of growth in the second quarter of the previous three months from 0.2% to 0.3% in the second quarter.
It is assumed that growth in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3%, although by the end of the year it will start to pick up slightly.
The latest inflation report has given a little bit of satisfaction to households suffering from rising inflation and terrible wage rises, saying that things are getting a little worse before getting better.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent a hit on income in the next few years, but a marked return of wages is expected at the end of the three-year forecast.
The weak pound also causes the economy to grow demand for British production, which makes some of the lower costs for consumers.
One year after the appointments last August 0,25% after the shocking EU-recorded presentation, which caused a sudden weakness of the nail.
It is likely that it will take four years to inhale prices and the economy in full.
At the beginning of the decision, there was a growing demand for a set, as inflation had led to a pressure on plighted households; in July, three policy options were required to be set at 0.5%.
The inflation fell by 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said it was expected and expected to return to the next month.
He said that the overstatement of the 2 percent goal was a full-bodied pound.
The head of Coreco's mortgage brokers, Andrew Motlake, said: "In view of the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming more and more competitive again, as lenders are looking for work and hoping to end the year positively.
The stock market seems to be particularly favourable to those transactions that are to be concluded, as refinancing, often with no service and low rates, has become more and more common."
NHS has been authorizing 10,000 people with a conflict of interest in the active substance.
Since September, he has access to preventive treatment of HIV after he was killed in the Supreme Court, whether NHS should fund the medicine.
NHU England has indicated that during the first three-year trial, the national diet is now making an estimated 10,000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (Prepe) available to humans, which is pre-requisited and has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 1% in high-risk people.
NHH agreed to finance a small experiment after the Appellate Court supported the Supreme Court’s last year’s ruling, according to which NH was able to pay for the PREP, despite the authorities’ own claims that the medicine should be financed by the real local authorities.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of NHS England, welcomed this Thursday's public movement as a "new wide intervention", while the National AIDS Fund (NAT) described it as "the reverse".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Greece and Sheffield will be the first to register people. In October, there will be more clinics before the program is launched in  commonly by April 2018.
Prepe is a course of medicines that are taken before an interval in order to reduce the risk of being infected with HIV.
The results of clinical trials show that Prpe significantly facilitates the spread of HIV among areas affected by the spread of infection.
Making a PrEP before it becomes a relationship means that there are plenty of drugs in the body that prevent infection in the human body.
What may be taken on a daily basis or at least two hours before an appointment may take place.
Appropriate actors include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people, partners are infected with HIV and not treated.
The clinic is identified by appropriate persons who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgenders and those whose HIV partner does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
The person who resides in the country and has chosen his/her family doctor can also register his/her wishes to participate in a local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost 10 million pounds and the NHS England Agreement to get the medicines after this procurement.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the totality of the PrEP by collecting a search for what is intended and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new intervention should complement and leverage the fight against widespread and ever more popular growth.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three years with one of the greatest health problems in the world."
Deborah Gold, NAT Executive Director, said: "This is an urgent moment in the fight against HIV.
Prep, if it is properly intended for those who consider it and belong to a risk group, it is an exception to the United States of America.
Since September, high-risk people in the country have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually manageable and does not rely on negotiations with a partner, through an experiment funded by the NHS, thus improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Terrence Higgins Foundation Executive Director Ian Green said: "Now it is essential to ensure that a clinical trial is speeded up across the country and that no risk team is left behind.
Now that the medicine is obtained, we are on the way to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk of being infected.
Prime Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the PreEP incident is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the sweeping of the moon's feet.
Evidence of the extent to which this medicinal product may lead to the cessation of prevention and the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial takes us a step to the full understanding of the interests of PrEP.
It is important now that the clinical trial takes place as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to take us a step to halting the spread of HIV in society."
The weather rose in Estonia by 12%, in Latvia and in Lithuania by 12%.
In July, the price difference between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania for the next day was EUR 1,94, with EUR 7, in June this year, Elering announced.
The main reason for this difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average price of electricity was EUR 34,33 per megawatt-hour last month and the price rose by 12 per cent in June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the figure fell by five percent to 36,27 euros of megawatt-hours.
In Finland, the price was 34,17 EUR and the price of Nord Pool was at the same time EUR 26,7 per megawatt-hour.
The equations are 12 and 7 respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved between Estonia and Finland 75 per cent of the last month from Estonia to Finland and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The following transactions shall not be reported for the remainder of the month.
Electricity flowed between Estonia and Latvia from 99 per cent of Estonia to Latvia, and 73 per cent of the hours were in full flow.
In the Nasdaq OMX market on the last day of July, the electricity price in August may be around EUR 34 and in September EUR 37 per mega-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t

Living high - half floor and smart designs have turned it into a second home in the apartment of the Earls staying room.
Joanne Lige, the contracting entity, who is a passionate real estate developer, exchanged his big Knightsbridge home for the Earls Court's apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed and resold her bags is a tribute to the new design.
"before that, I lived with my ex-partner at Knightsbridge on a much larger surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to my offer.
It was shown in the Earls Bank apartment and it was like a high ceiling.
I fell in love with him and I fell in love with him the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has completed an innovation.
In the beginning, it was a single bedroom and a single-bedroom apartment with a complete layout had to be passed through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to use high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my choices," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from the Institute of Architecture and Design Duck & Shed in Notting Hill to use 3.8 m height ceilings and to create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The law was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to get involved in the business.
"Metal conversion is quite complex," he changes.
"We need to reorganise the premises so that they are on one another without having to lie down.
This was not just about building a platform, but we used the steel structure so that the height of both the upper and the lower space would be right."
This enabled Erfan to create two full-length rooms in one room with a lot of dramatic elements.
On the other side, the modern, bright, retro-uvius window opens up into a glamorous living room under the view.
The mirrored golden furniture, the fiery details and the retro-reflected Serge Mouille's luminaire highlight the space style.
The change of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and lightness.
On each side of the four corridors, mirrors appear to be attached to it.
The kitchen leaves a mirror with a back wall in the other room with an open window.
The entrance provides a mirror for all Joanne's food and change.
In the living room, there is an opportunity to close the part of the text if it is not used, creating an image of a more global space.
The kitchens that are being adjusted have nothing to do with it.
However, in this kitchen it is a unique fact that this is a garage-top door to be raised.
"There went the design effort," Erfan amends the MDF door, which has been sprayed with fiscal strength.
"There is a counter-optim, so that it will slip very easily if it is rejected."
For smart use of space and space, Joanne now has 16 extra meters, a single room and a better apartment plan.
"At the end of the day, the floor is what you sell - or what gives value to value," says Erfan.
"The real estate broker enters the room in an old-fashioned form and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here he has tried to increase the floor surface by using high-quality materials that add luxury to the space.
"The materials are what you touch and what helps you to make an emotional connection with your home," Erfan.
"You do not fall in love with the electric power battle in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make the hearts ring."
This seems to be a good way and an enhanced effort to help you do something about the usual housing.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Publicsen, is the Chicago-based bounty hunter, who is competing with the colleague for the promotion of the profession.
All that matters is the amount of money earned, which forgets any transaction.
She and the three see men in the morning and late evening.
On the first side of the paper, it seems to me that it is the "Cardhouse" in the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech manager are the same.
The more he goes on, the more he stays in the house and the moral intent of the filmmakers is starting to look more and more like it.
Life-changing experience leads to cancer of the main character's son's infirmation.
It's between work and family now.
A dreamer son from an architect's office makes it easier for his father to walk to Chicago's home for essential things such as faith, goodness, love..., and even the disaster of the twins.
After the third scene, when a son opens his father, it seems that the filmmakers have taken a chance to cry, even when the eyes of the most horrid person can't stop the tears from seeing the sweet poor boy's suffering.
When a son comes along, and his condition looks hopeless, the father can be sure to understand his work and do good work for the old man.
Now I'm going to drag myself - if the film is happy, then I'm going to prep my vision after the movie's dinner, but if I'm wrong, then the screenplayer can be praised for at least one statement.
For a second, there was a suspicion that I would miss my coffee... when he asked Dane to go to the hospital... and he was rushing down the hall in time.
However, the son is strangely well, and even though his father is at work, this will prove to be perfect, for now it is time to deal with the family.
I can have a good time too. I can see America right now!
In giving the truth, the film is well designed, all necessary elements exist.
She can cry, can laugh, see things are good and moral: money is not the most important thing in life.
I guess that'll work.
The new Supreme Court intends to influence the media consumption of the President.
Others have failed and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do this for real.
If he did.
Poltico writes that the New Assembly of the North House intends to influence the flow of information to President Trump, including news, hoping that it will keep the top in a raised water.
Here's a broken reporter from Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the Central House, met with high officials on his first day, he found out the question at President Donald Trump's meeting at the House, which he was planning to deal with in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the public that the information had to go through her, maybe at a meeting, or at a meeting, because she'd be better off if she was given a good opening."
The diagnosis of Kelly seems perfectly logical, but others have failed to do so, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media activity.
The relationship between the party and the television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the middle of the house, his television routines are nowhere to be lost.
"If Mr Trump was upset about the unfair media coverage, he should have been shown that he was also honestly reflected in the publications that were affected," said Sam Nunberg, in February, to Politico.
At the time, Politico Tara Palmer wrote that "the key to controlling Trump's best habits is to ensure that his personal media activity often includes praise".
All right.
However, the idea that the habits of using the Trump Twitter have never been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these rebels know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's messengers would have been even more exciting without their intervention.
We will never know about the rumors that Trump never sent.
If his assistant could help him out, or a few times, their efforts were.
No one can ever help Trump to cause anything more than that.
The problem is that people in the United States, together with competing CDs, are just trying to promote their own interests by passing on to Trump the material that supports their world views, but it may not always be reliable.
The whole story of Politico letter, which was written in May, went on to tell the President about the consultants' willingness to feed the President in advance the information he asked for.
One example of a reporter of Shane Goldmacher is:
"The current and new Trumps are saying that Trump can react to a test of violence, especially those that have a damaging effect on information, explode, become obsessed with the identification of their source.
This was also the case at the end of February when someone gave the president a copy of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johns web page of GotNews.com, an article in which Deputy Head of Staff, Katie Walshi, said she was "a messenger of several messages" to the Central House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson has been disputed because of the miscarriage, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has also filed a false inquiry and returned it.
Trump read the article and began asking about Walshi."
Goldmacher added that the then head of the staff of Reince Priebus and the Head of the Office of the South House Rob Porter "has failed to establish a system for the administration and programming of the documents that Trumpi has reached."
How did that work out?
Three months later, he's gonna try to do the same thing again.
Maybe he will be the best leader in Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for the influence.
These invariably changing factors make it very difficult for us to do so.
There is no permission to get a demonstration of bitterness from a foreign capital station.
In the centre of the city of Tallinn, many foreigners are music-making abroad.
Those who talked about this evening admitted that they were playing in the city without the government's permission.
The first we found was a fellow at the gate of Viru, who had eaten as much as he did.
Obviously, the musician with the raspberry and the broken clothes was a backpack traveler that could use a shower.
As a matter of appearance, the rest of the staff had a good time telling a story, while a man next to him had a three-ball juggler and called a passerby.
The man was sitting next to them on a backpack, and he was smoking a self-made mess in the heart.
The three dogs did not allow themselves to be disturbed by the past.
The show was played with Noem and the balls, and Bob told me that they were flapping on words both for fun and after.
The purpose of the event was to raise the money for a ship that sailed to Finland on the same night.
In addition, did they ask the city for permission to play music in the city, shaking Noemi and Bob's head?
We didn't know.
So, we'll never stay in one house more than a day or a few, and most of the time, they'll give us a month or something.
It doesn't make any sense", Bob.
About 20 minutes later, when we got back to the Viru Gates, we realized that the two of them were with the musician and were going to drive away.
The soul moved in with his backpack and dog to the Viru Centre's crossbow to see if he could get any luck.
There were also three Polish presidents on Viru Street, one of whom played a violin, the other a kprint, and the other who had been carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to give pleasure to spread music and joy, and to make money for money and life," explained Trio Pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivosh, they are aware of the need to be authorised by the government to perform a performance.
"Of course we don't have this," say he's joking.
But we hope that if the people of society believe in our music, then there is no problem.
For example, if the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
Estonia purchased EUR 149 million in loans under the general government asset purchase programme of the general government in July, totalling EUR 4.36 billion.
No more detailed information on the purchase will be published.
Eesti Pank President Hardo Hansson has previously explained, in response to the views of the members of the Riigikogu, that the asset transfer programme of the Eurosystem comprises three different buy-in notes: government bonds (covered bonds), asset bonds (AAS) and government bonds (120).
On the market, he buys up a bond to ask the sellers who sold it to change their money.
The buyer influences the production of low-risk assets and encourages investors to take bigger risks.
As a general rule, each central bank purchases a central government bond in the framework of a public tender, other countries do not purchase any other debt.
Since the State of Estonia has not signed, Estonia will make a new replacement purchase in volume.
They will also be purchased by central banks in those countries where the offer of the corresponding mortgage is limited.
Estonia purchases Hansss's confirmation of the European institutions' contracts, such as the European System of Central Banks and the European Investment Bank.
Estonia will buy a contract under an emergency programme from March 2015 onwards.
Sometimes Elering's bond was also purchased, but since June 2016, Estonia has stopped buying Elering's contracts.
Both Elering and the Central Bank of Estonia have been buying for the euro area since June.
The migrants ignore the ditch and return to the "millions of the District".
Some of the wealthiest home owners in Midlands have once again come up against determined migrants who have ignored the digged-out by the council to return to the field that remains away from their homes.
The travelers have moved their 20 trailer summers to the field near the head of the wealthy "millionaires in the District" of Soliheli.
They have returned with horses, trucks and trucks after they had just been kicked out of the market, to let themselves be disturbed by a warehouse that was dug by the council to stop their invasion.
A practical measure found itself in a weak position in the protection limits, squeezing their vehicles from the part that was a foothold.
The angry inhabitants of the country have been expelled by the Solijui Council, saying that the public is "useless to deal with the problem".
A single anonymous resident said: "They moved on that Monday night after they were deported from Bentley Heieus, where they threw stones at passers-by.
The jury must be alarmed that they are going to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there, he was time to go, and now he's back.
It came to an end yesterday, more today."
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining a long barrier to making its own parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook, and I am not happy that I must continue to pay the public tax if the Council can't change that."
One local resident who also wanted to be anonymous, says: "It's ridiculous. We just saw, the last of these migrations left, and it's already happening.
It's been growing, and the grass is even remembering."
The representative of the Council of Ministers said: "We are aware that in a country close to the Streetsbrook, there is an unacceptable courtship and we are cooperating with the Solihol police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
It will be very helpful to collect evidence if every resident in the country reports any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police, calling number 101.
This will help to create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case."
The weekend festival is also visited by Minister of Culture Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring true world top names into Estonia.
The question of why the Weekend Foundation is so important to Estonians is asked by the House that it should be asked of all those who spend three days talking to the fullest of the Estonians.
But he knows that the truth is coming to Pärnu.
"Looking at this level of artists, which has been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute titles of this musician will be brought back to the hands - this is not happening in our village," says the Minister of Culture.
What are the greatest artists to talk about in the audience?
I think I'm a little old-fashioned, and for people like me, it's certainly one of the most experienced artists, Armin van Buuren, who quit last night.
According to his disking, in any case, everything in this particular case is self-tapped," he says.
But he's still bringing out a number of words, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Also our own Estonian player: starting with the NO!P and the whole of the game.
In fact, this named concentration of names is very high," he says.

Refreshs the criticism of the car manufacturers of up to 850 000 diesel vehicles.
The day before the Audi announcement, you said that you would provide software additional to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the President-in-Office, the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the home town of Munich, which has considered the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Tuesday that he will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe for the emission of diesel engines.
No entity described the transactions as a recall.
European car manufacturers have been eager to use diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help them comply with the emission regulations.
The oxide from the former diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and may cause asthma.
In addition, the cost of the equipment used to neutralise the exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles for motor vehicles increased by making it difficult to keep the car price below the price.
While German car manufacturers are under investigation, the Government of the Union Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
They are trying to avoid repeating the errors of Volkswagen, which, while leaving behind the use of so-called decoy devices that made it possible to adapt the exhaust reading to the regulations during the test of the car, but retreated in normal times.
Several Volkswagen drivers have been requested in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, the Sub-President of the Department of Inquiry in the Research and Development Department was arrested.
Former President Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected and may go to trial in the United States.
At the beginning of the year, the Auditor in Germany was dragged into the Volkswagen case when the Authority asked for an audit to be installed in order to circumvent the European emission standards, thereby extending the investigation that had previously addressed the United States.
The involvement of Volkswage in the investigation may be a great blow to the luxury car manufacturer generating a disproportionate proportion of Volkswage's profits.
The European Union flags will be awarded to Estonian schools for 20,000 euros.
The Minister of State intends to buy European Union flags to appoint a presidency for the Estonian schools by 1 September.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of education in the European Union is available for 5th time.
The flags are intended to be used in the indoors of the exposition, they must have been carried out in a high-quality printing bag in the indoors, also with a tunnel fixing, the ERR news feeder will be equipped with an ERR news feeder.
The flaguvarda label is replaced by the following text: "Kinging for the Estonian Schools to designate the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union for Estonia.
The estimated cost of the 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the price of the Ministry of Education, i.e. one ticket costs EUR 35.
The newspaper's murder was a major threat in Mexico.
The Riodoce staff usually gathers together to review plans to reflect the latest chaos in the state of the United States of America, which is sown by crime, corrupt fires and incessant drug wars.
Today, they are gathered in personal tragedy to discuss their own reality.
They say it is important to change their routine.
The duplicates discuss, which seems safer: either bring the children with them to the house, which was the target of the 2009 grenade attack, or leave them to die.
Security experts have written the word "popular", "neutress", " foreigner" in the front of the room.
They call on the reporters to ask the police of every column to provide no evidence, no influence and no sense of conscience.
The government or cartels are suspected of being on the sale of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists as many as three perils who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos of a foreign currency.
There are no breathtakings of violence, and the more dead bodies are gathered across the country, the more journalists say that since President Enrique Pena Nieto's oath in December 2012, at least 25,589 journalists have been killed after attacks and threats under national protection, and during this year, at least a dozen people have been killed in the United States.
The five survivors include their editor and their source of inspiration, the Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in a box and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug abuse.
His presence is profound, although his presence can sense everywhere on the façade of the Rioja building hangs a large picture of Valdez, the mid-screening Valdez with a letter entitled "Justice" and two 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramamez, wearing T-shirts that show his face or his character.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death. Reporters will discuss a common trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor’s Office was set up in 2010 to deal with press cases, only two cases have been brought before the Press Protection Committee.
As in the case of most annual drug trafficking and drug trafficking-related murders involving thousands of people, journalists rarely go to court for murder.
In Riodoce's influence, it continues to reflect a strong understanding of the subject, although their hearts are broken and the earth is now even more dangerous.
Without the information of the killers and justice, the meeting on security is of no use to Ibarra.
"It's too stupid to waste your time in this meeting," she says.
"As long as the cause is not known, you'll be distrusting everyone."
Valdez left the Rioja office in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on 15 May.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before two men stopped his red Tokyo Corol, forced him to get out of the car, and he was shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "twelfth river".
The armed man drove out of Valdez's car and made an accident.
Valdez was a year old.
She was left behind by a woman and two grown-up children.
Rumors are spreading freely in Uliacan.
However, Valdez is essentially just a quiet one.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and in January of the United States of America, Salolo has been one of the bloodiest battle fields in the country since the rival clicks are fighting for the exercise of power.
No matter if on the streets of Salalo, any person is shot every day or even twice as many, or that the garden is filled with a lot of creeds of double-hulling tales of the two-regular kings, which are bigger than the homes of many living people.
For a moment, peace implies that only one cartel is being used by valuable ports and the state of the sea with drug routes to the United States of America.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, the Riojadobe empathizes with the feeling that he would not be able to protect his friend.
He thinks he did.
Of them, one of Guzman's sons was in the February interview with President Damascus Lopez, who was in the middle of a war cartel.
This letter could have pissed off the suspected members of the force bought all the messages as soon as they got to the newspaper store.
The other mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country in his own name after an interview took place in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both inside and abroad, and his killing is seen as a point of violence against journalists.
He had lived so long that he and you assumed he was forever.
She worked for a veteran report at Noores in the year when she joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, i.e. 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that in Sõloo, "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem".
The paper over time saw its felt and felt and felt with its fair and honest statements.
The reporters liked to give powerful studies without fear of censorship, and readers in the enchantment that they could read stories that no one else could seem to look at.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her Latin American presentations.
This year, the Valdez Press Protection Committee (AKK) won the award for the religious freedom of the press for its courage to follow the drug history of everywhere it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to move on," he said to accept the AKK Award.
At last, he said in an interview with Rompevieto TV on TV that drug trafficking is a way of life in Salaloa.
"You must accept the task of the Press Office, which is a different way of fooling you.
I don't want to be asked what I was doing when I faced all the deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riocane collective longs for Valdez, a playful man, who was crawling like a worm, a friend, who kindly shared applause and advice, a teacher who knew how to live, how to
Support for his routine.
He was always carrying his own place.
He went through the door on the way to the El Guanabo bar and always sat in the same place.
Now they're asking if his love for the routine became his destiny.
He has helped us to cultivate a fine attitude toward others.
"You don't like it when you dump their wives, their children, their legal goods, their secret landing grounds, used to transport pots."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
Even in the best of times, the result is strong self-esteem and self-maintenance.
Confidence of the essentials.
If it seems suspicious, stay away from it.
Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said the problem is, "The smell can be deceived... and this is something about Javier."
He and others say that there are no longer old rules in Sololo, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerreros and other states that are home to the association of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The world is changing.
In the room where Riotake’s staff met for security purposes, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before it was revealed that only the spyware sold to the government had been used to track journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two policemen sought relief from 40 degrees of heat in a tree.
The government appointed them to guard against the Riodoce office located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered if these policemen were one of the 50 officers who the governor himself thought had been suspicious.
It has been a few months since the reporters have gone to mountainous lands where control is in de facto by the gangs.
Rioe's publication of this week discussed three basics.
One of them was the murder of Bobio Cesar Chavez, the chief of the poker player, in Selloloa.
In addition, they had a terrible state of spending money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culikacan, a district away from the district of the Prosecutor.
There had been no official announcement of who was robbed or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it came to writing what every restaurant in the city knows about it is both a place of sale and a place of speech.
The reporter learned from the public documents that the restaurant has been registered in the name of a politician who is a member of the current Institutional Reform Office (IRP), which dominated all the law throughout the whole of the year.
In recent times, several IR governors have been accused of corruption in the context of large-scale coverage cases.
The manager asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including what they call El Chapo kandva Guizman's son escaped from the military.
Just a few months ago, the readers would have been looking for Valdez's column to get from the kidnappers.
"We would have known by now what happened," said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose kleeneke design has earned his nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels have broken with our sources."
Valdez’s headquarters has become a storage for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists and for the inaugural workers have become something they never expected for the sake of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took up a few loans and went to the office of the local D.A.'s office the next time after another journalist.
In the Western state of Milan, Pakistan disappeared three days after the killing of Valdez.
The dead body is gone, and his father says it belongs to him.
Journalists throughout the country have become more louder and criticise the phrase "SOS press" as a protest of many ways and buildings.
The President, Mr Bojorquez, is in Washington, trying to gather support in the Valdez case for putting the word on the table.
The day after Valdez's death, when he met with the Governor of Salalo, the government accused the public authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from the government's account to another, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had once said that journalists of the press are "limited" by all kinds of crime, co-indicted state officials and by the rest of the community.
In his last book, the "Narco press", he wrote that reporters are not only killed by protest forces, but also by the order of the politicians and the Republic of Estonia, who are killed by crime.
Last year, the Media Network Articulo 19 dedicated more than half of the press's attacks to prayer and to the public officials.
"Mexicans will die because they want to keep me quiet," said Ramizez.
Murders are acting more or less verdantly.
No one will ever forget the death of bona fide Mariaæ Macas in Tamaulpa, northern border state, six years ago in Tamaulpa.
The body was found with a letter which had not been signed on the map in Los Zeta: "I'm here for my reports."
Next to the cut head, there were mufflers and headgear lying next to the cut head.
Some of the publications have decided to close their doors, for example, in the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chuhuhu, after killing Miroslava Breach, their correspondent, in March.
Others go on as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did for their President in 2004.
In 2005, the newspaper Diaro de Ciudad Juarez spoke with the pre-screened manuscript "What do you want us to do?".
Journalists have left the home state or even the country.
This is a negligent decision.
It's hard to find, and they're still trying to sneak around to protect their threats.
And sometimes they're chasing it, like the ex-Smuben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in one of the States of Mexico in 2015 after his three deportation from Veracruz.
Those who stay in place and work need to change their decisions every day.
Irra, who ever wanted to become a poet, admits that the reflection of a commodity scares him.
"Mexico's going to hell, and that's what I started reporting," he said.
In the middle of one of the last Fridays, when the freshest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors sat on the front of the court and rang beer when they suddenly started vibrating all the phones.
19 people were reportedly killed during the fires between the rival gangs and the security forces in Mazatati, near the coast resort town of Mazatlan.
Go on and on, as were the messages from several regions.
From the same point of view, reporters posted news on their mobile phone using the  Riodoce website.
change the first day of the day.
Sirens were echoing in another fire zone.
Boorquez was watching over the police force to see if they were alert.
If they were afraid, they wouldn't.
The newspaper founder, under a massive pressure from the founder, in which his middle finger is visible to the whole of the lottery, carried out by Riodoce’s staff in his wake.
"How can I even think about writing," said Bojorquez, "as if the day Javier was killed, ask the Intersect to send him to report on the report?"
Dinosaur used protective paints to prevent enemies.
At first glance, it seems like a shape, even though it's pretty scary.
Scientists have now announced the first findings regarding the existence of the incredible size of the nation of Canada's miner, which has been so well established that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauruss".
It's been so good that it could even be found that the skin covered in his armor was a fun brown color and his past had been somewhat "hard".
The report published in Current Biology describes the existence as "the best-preserved olimus dinosaurus that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a new species of nodosaur that moved in the middle of the crucifixion 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation of all the knowledge that envisions it as "really significant".
According to the National Plane of the magazine National, this botanist covered in artillery has the best knowledge of the fossil that has ever been found.
This was found on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he mined Suncor Mining in Fort McMurray, near North Albania, Canada.
There was something else that did not reflect the pervasive stone, and began to look further into it.
The opened fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrelli Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, it was developed to dig the animal out of a plot of 2500 pounds of land (U.S.) per 100 kilograms.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be prepared.
"When a few eyes are cast, one might believe that he is asleep," said the author of the lead, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrel Museum, where he is exposed.
"It goes to the scientific market as one of the most beautiful and most popular dinosaur implants - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
He studied his food by scientists that this vegetative food, which is covered with pelts and resembles a moving tank, was likely to be seriously threatened by edible dinosaurs.
It used red and white paint to hide from predators, and it used shades of shade, called counterintelligence, and what the animals today use.
This enabled the experts to better encroach on the dinosaur and to avoid enemies, since the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him down.
This 110-year-old nodosarista's presence is the first time on the news and is now visiting the Royal Tyrel Palace Museum.
Scientists have now researched the creature and named it Borealotet Mark Mitell, the laboratory of the Mark Mitell, who was a member of the team that spent more than 7,000 hours trying to expose the animal to annoyance.
Thanks to the very good preservation of the individual, Dr. Mitell and the international scientific team were able to document the shape and size of the animals on the body.
He discovered a counterintelligence - a method of protection in the United States, which means that the top of the present was darker than the bottom.
Although the counter-intelligence has spread, the findings come as a surprise, since there are far more Boreadal animals than those living in the present day.
This suggests that other carnivorous dinosaurs were actively chasing the dinosaurs, that the e-mail wanted to hide from the survival act of conflict.
However, most modern animals using counterintelligence - e.g. vegetals, zebras or vegans - are much worse and more easily than the prey, which suggests that they will survive.
"The forceful pursuit of a dinosaurus, which is covered with enormous and many passions, shows how dangerous they may have been from the dinosaurs of the crucifixion," said Brown.
A chemical analysis of the compounds of the so-called so-called so-called organic compounds revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was brand-new brown.
They're trying to study the animal to get clues about this life, including its gut, to figure out what the animal didn't eat last.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into a dead river, thus reaching the sea with a flow where it fell on the back of the ocean floor.
At the same time, Alberta was as warm as she was now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to be much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is remarkable, as it is fully covered in the leather, while it remains a three-dimensional, retaining the shape of the gun," said Brown.
"For this reason, today, the present world looks just as much like a crisis age.
You don't have to use much imagination to rebuild it - it's just enough to tear your eyes out, and it seems like he's asleep."
The era of change was the time when the earth was crawling on two feet of moving carnivorous dinosaurs - theorodes.
Although all of their King Tyrnasaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealova, some of his frightening predecessors could have hunted this armoured dinosaur.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons weighing monster.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the magazine Current Biology believe that Borealopet has been attacked in the sea after death and that it is mummy in mud.
It was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk, when he mined the Mining Mine in Fort McMurray, near North Albania, Canada.
In the museum's words, it is the best surviving artillery in the world, including leather and armor, and it is from the whole cone to the trees.
The average length of these entities was 18 m (millimetres) long and weighing up to 3,000 pounds (1 to 1 kg).
Two 20-inch stork broke out of this straw.
They believe that this canopy-filled vegetarian has been on the run through this western canada until the flooded river sank into its desert.
But the place where the Dinosaur was buried in the sea helped to preserve its loins in great detail.
The stoned remains of this particular substance have been so well held that the skull of the dinosaur is still covered by the contours of the strange soot plates.
As Michael Greshko stated in the National Statistical: "This degree of survival is as rare as lottery victory.
I'll look at it, the more incredible it is.
Stones are covering the plastic plates on the skull.
The forefoot lies next to him and five toes are straight upwards.
I'm able to count the medals on him."
How did one active man respond to the question, "Who are the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a full shock.
After a day's travel to New York, it sat in a room rented by St. Louis's resident Airbnbüt in the room, looking into the mail.
He went after his former schoolmate's post.
It said, "Police killed just 18 years of age, and he's still in Thanksgiving."
He was wondering why no one else had sent this information to his stream, so he sent Facebook and opened it up.
Pidemega @TheePharah user's posts had been distributed once in his time.
The rapper from St. Louis sent a live message to Michael Brown, not to replace the 18-year-old black president, who was killed in Pigus Missouri.
He posted a picture of the lifeless body of Brown lying around the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," meant Frell's uncle.
there was nothing for him or his community.
He put his head away, but the other night, a call that changed the whole thing from the Canance Drive.
They shared photos of the police and screaming people and the man who pretended to be Brown's father and kept a note saying, "Fercopol's police are killing my unmistakable son!"
He was watching a live stream where the police were standing in front of a group of protesters with a bark.
In the second video, another officer threw a gun at him and shouted, "I will kill all the animals..."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"It's not the kind of murder that we're used to and what we could call "the type of one."
At this moment, I felt a sense of perceptiveness.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After 23 o'clock, he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they were going to Fergus the next morning with the two of them.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is a central topic in the new document "Whose Streets?" (Who's Streets?) which will take place in cinemas on 11 August.
It's a story of survival and prosperity, of love and belief, of strength and of obedience to the vision of those people, of living in this community, and of those who asked for answers.
When Ferrell and his son - who wore a flower dress and had to talk about it - went to Fergu in half, they talked about the other thing that they had to tell about before this evening - the experience and living conditions of the blacks.
"Do you mind if I teach you how to defend the black community for its own rights?" she says.
"We're going to hit Fergus now, because he killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him," said Ferrell.
"What is going on now is... the convection of what has happened in the past.
He must know and see and grow.
He must learn about activeness and organization, and at the same time feel the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we must do to be free and free.
Even if I manage to raise her by not personally experiencing blatant racism, she does not differ from any other daughter-in-law.
I think I'd do him a favor if I protected him from this world."
At the moment they arrived, on the South Florida road, they were stuck in the police station all over the road, which had become a certain kind of ground where the activists were waiting for news of Miss Darren Wilson, and they were not finally presented.
Here you linked Ferrell and his daughter to the local business owner who made lunches.
They put together the food bags and helped them share with the protesters.
For Ferelli, a new type of activity slowly began to take the form of new types of activity.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, saying that when she was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, she was the president of the most popular Teachers' Association and focused on food and health inequalities in religious communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It's all just going down."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell was in court with a co-director of a film, Sabaah Folayan, who was co-director of the film.
Folayan said that he and his financial operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar were data created.
Ferrelli's main question asked: "Are you looking for a document or find what can be used for?"
Taine scepticism was the result of an innumerable count of cases where people - often white - go into the community and seek to benefit from its pain and ability.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that there was no sounding in the name of Fergusson and those who have grown up and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region, who was known for his activeness in relation to convicted prisoners.
His involvement changed the data for Ferrelli and for two other places he watched for years after the film "Whose Streets?" was shot by Brown.
"In this formal film, none of us speak for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"For me, it was important how this image was displayed, so it was."
The aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - he wanted to show that the movement was not a "salesman's guide, but a community's meeting", as Follayan said - was the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents the personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
'I felt like I was naked,' said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw a linen.
"But I realized that this work and the humanization of religious people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
More than that, Ferrelli's story and reintroduces the idea of a Jewish wife in the wider movement of Black Lives Matter.
The six of the three initiators, who thought of the themes #BlackLivesMatter, following the murder of a black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 in social media, are homosexual.
"The leading black homosexual woman has generally managed the movement," said Ferrell, "and that is precisely because we have to fight on several sides all the time.
"The unsuspecting homosexual house is telling the whole of this."
Folayan agreed to say that "the movement is actually kept alive by black women, and many of them are from homosexual women."
However, he claims that "it is not the case that there is no idea of creating any equal opportunities with regard to the matter" - Ferrelli was not designated as the centre of the year because of his identity.
"He was a man with the right energy," he said.
"But it is not a coincidence that he was right on the sidelines, because as a black homosexual woman living at such points, there is much to be done when she lives at such points.
It is possible to detect energy through the screen.
At the same time, the news cameras have disappeared from Ferguson, but the racial connection between the community and the police is still fragile.
The term of validity for Frell during the protest for the purpose of abandonment of the land will last for a further period of twenty-two years.
He describes the social political atmosphere in the area he calls his home, a "roaring bonfire".
However, he still attaches great importance to the mantra he has been forgetting since he went to the Fergusno message all three years ago.
"Our duty is a measure of our own freedom.
It's win.
We must love and support.
We don't have to lose anything but our chat rooms."
9 pins how to get over the hang of the weekend party after the party.
Some of the tougher husbands may find after a day’s visit to see what is wrong with it, help with it.
Or are they based on the expression "extremely pomphlet, stay drunk".
But it's just a necessary delay and a decent son of a bitch.
What can you do to feel better about yourself and get over yourself as painless as possible after thanking and tomorrow's Weekly treat or whatever?
Drink.
Alcohol down and on, after a great evening ... or, if possible, in place of anything.
The body wears a lot of juice when it eats, then it needs to be returned.
The water also sheds solids out of the body and soaps are good at drinking water.
Since the stomach is often agitated by drinking, it is especially good if it is light-headed butter.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't cost you to go to Grandma to blow up trees - this could be a fatal lie.
A light walk helps the body to remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in the tent and tearing out the hangover is a more time-consuming way to recover.
Give the body energy back slowly and with caution.
If you've been drinking since last night, I'm not gonna try to load up the big one.
For example, an example of fresh juice that contains sugars to keep your body quiet.
If you're ready for lunch, try some broth.
And then a little back later.
Coffee served.
This drug will release your body from any last water.
I'm telling you, water is yours.
Apply to the painkiller.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a porpoise, your liver must not only deal with alcohol but also parasemole or ibuprofen and lose performance in this way.
You're going to do it any more, and now you're going to do it worse than that.
It doesn't last much longer anyway.
If you want some pain, don't do it, it's gonna piss you off.
Or if you don't take a partner, you can do it yourself.
Sounds like walking, but walking can't be an orgasm.
However, too active an attitude and an insanity of poses during the time of the post should try to be in a state of play.
Come on.
Talking to friends and friends fools, doing simple stupid things, and laughing naturally about yourself as well as other (suffering) things.
A joke and a nerve may not upset the hangover, but it will certainly be more fun to bear the symptoms of these symptoms.
Once in a while, it'll be over anyway.
The professor of the Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford are wanted as suspects of murder.
It is said that there is a nationwide search for a Northwestern University professor and a staff member of the University of Oxford who has become suspects since the discovery of a male body with deadly stab wounds in one of the luxury apartments in Chicago.
According to the Cook County Courts, on Monday, without bail, arrest missions were issued for the first time indictment of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathemi and 56-year-old Andrew Warren in the first instance of their alleged connection to the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Dranleau, who was accused of killing Trenton H. James Cornell-Dranleau.
According to the documentation, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabilization.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on 27 July.
The migrants received a phone call and shot the Grand Plaza apartment building in front of a victim whose body had been injured by a puncture wound.
According to the authorities, at the Cornell-Duranleau incident, the police were declared dead and the investigators were considered to be stab wounds as murder, while the police are looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co-professor of Microbiology and Immunology since 2007 at the University of Northwestern.
As regards public relations with the university, Alan K. Cubbage said in an e-mail that Lathem has now been suspended and has been prohibited from entering the cities of the University of Northwest.
"It is now a matter for the competent authorities to investigate, and the University of Northwestern is working with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is an senior assistant at the University of Oxford's Financial Department.
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in the Community with the United States of America and have prepared to assist U.S. research authorities in any way possible."
It was also said that Warren was shocked and wanted to kick his ass.
Anthony Gugliel, Head of the Chicago Police Department Communication Department, recommends that, on suspicions of being forced to turn himself over to the authorities.
"The police have a sense of where they are, but we are increasingly engaged in defining the exact location," Gugliel said.
Gugliel said that the search for suspects is helped by local, regional and national authorities alike.
Gugliel said that the police received a phone call from the Grand Plaza flat house manager, who had just received a crypt tip that there has been something going on in 1008.
It is said that it was a magical image.
Gugliel said that it is not clear whether the event itself took place on July 27 as well.
He said the security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren's presence in the house.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Gugliel said.
Grand management of the inhabitants of the letter: "The police are currently working on the identification of the subject's chronology and the victim's background, and they are investigating different motives, including the assumption that this was a family dispute."
The Idea companies that help your company to look for the next Uber to become Uber.
Amy Vätt wanted to measure the job satisfaction of her e-commerce start-up company, but the surveys were not profitable.
Opposition was often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to secure anonymity, he did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Rätt, who runs the e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells gas products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
He called for help from outsiders.
New types of human resource start-ups are at stake to help companies figure out how they feel.
In the development and licensing of the software, the purpose of which is to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct all-time surveys, to target specific teams and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaints on the hotline and, in some cases, to allow them to go along C-level leads and to contact the Bureau directly.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to watch your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, the co-founder and CEO of Redwood City, Glint, whose software tool for the involvement of workers.
According to this, in the course of the three years he has been using Glinti, he has gained much better insight into what he thinks and feels about the work.
For the follow-up and specific surveys, it offers a machine card, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which chairs have the lowest support, allowing it to identify reasons.
They have been told that they must remain alert to their work culture to avoid becoming the next Uber, which has been wrapped up in scandals since the arrival of a blog post by another employee, which described a troubling environment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups such as Gint, there is an insight into the desire to own a profitable business.
The global management, regulation and balance area may be more than EUR 118,7 per year in accordance with the Annual Report on Let's Talk Payments.
In the context of the suspicious reputation of Uber this year, Uber's influence on the growth of activity and interest in the company's activities, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber's registration has been very recent.
As opposed to Glink, the Convercent companies will allow them to change impulse surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and look at data sheets from problematic areas.
This enables an anonymous communication service to enable workers to report conflicts of conduct.
And in the case of the Executive Director, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Assembly.
"The public opinion has been stolen by the regulatory authority," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convence.
I said that if an enterprise is found to treat its employees badly or to behave abnormally, the company may have serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, dismissals and cases, even if the regulatory authority does not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a network with more than 25,000 employees at 500 establishments, has been using the Converent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide a simple way of communicating with the headquarters of the event.
If the employee wanted to report the problem in the past, he had to make a call from the corporate headquarters or an email address, file a complaint, and hope that it will be committed.
This was often an unpleasant and uncomfortable process," said Mr Vitrano, who was not good at listening to the facts.
Now that the company is using the Convercent, it is possible to do things, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices, which did not pass through before, acting in other cities or parts of the country, to witness and engage in crime.
"I can access workers' holistic 360-degree experience," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
"and we protect our members from conflicts with employees."
Quinlan said that the company began to engage in ethical activities, values and employees more seriously in 2002, perhaps after Arthur Andersen, the auditor, collapsed due to the ethical change in relation to the Enron scandal.
But only when "social media became available" did the children realize that they could not change their food to clean online publicly.
"The use of this technology to monitor the way it is behaved," he said.
Both Glint and the Converter will provide their own software service by making a periodic fee for the use of their own products by the companies.
This is a business model and an opportunity to approve venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
In February, the Converci was financed by 10 million tons of goods, such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capita, increasing the value of this collected value to 47 million dollars.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer Ventures in November, raising the company from the total debt to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a result of taking into account the relationship between the economic, economic and investment sectors.
More and more studies seem to expect more than ever.
Competitive goods, such as silicon Valley, are high wages and interesting projects just for the remaining contributions.
Workers tend to think that they are accepted and valued and that they are referring to their own business, which is a definite mission.
"When people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is rewarding, they are more successful in making sure of the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is a part of the department of general benefit and work experience in LinkedIn, which uses both Converent and Glint.
Investments will generate income if their total companies are doing well; companies will do well when the employee is busy and busy.
If the third half of the analytical work allows for an increase in the responsibilities and involvement of workers, then it is no wonder that they will support them.
The knowledge of employee involvement is an important factor in the skills of the workforce.
These data will be useless if the company supervisors do nothing about it.
If an entity asks its employees to return, it may create expectations that they are awaiting a change.
And if the change is not sufficiently severe or not, this could lead to disappointment and encourage employee involvement.
"If you ask 4000 proposals, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, the Consultancy and Business Administration, who has seen how companies make a mistake by supporting too much data collection.
'Cause if things aren't being played out, they're thinking, "Did you actually listen to me?
You care?
And if you don't care, then I care?"
It is said that Madison Reed, who is conducting surveys among workers this month, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
After having received feedback from disappointed employees in decision-making and communication quality, he was able to re-examine the company and offer communication training to deal with the problems.
However, new data on employees will be collected in Ruby Tuesdays and it is expected that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment by workers in the industry, which is known for its high labour flow.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will take the lead," said Vitrano.
"and if you kill people, you kill people.
And if you kill customers, you lose customers."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltic: incomes are growing rapidly.
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade with Russia has affected the Baltic States, three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, referring to the report by the European Parliament.
According to data, the total GDP of the population in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has expressed expectations since then.
There is a need for debt, a need to move forward and a policy of the Single Market and the Single Market.
"Baltic countries with one Slovakia are among the few euro area countries where the central bank per person is close to the EU average", the central bank.
The aim is to ensure that the economy’s total GDP per capita equality with the poorest in Western Europe, in 2015, total GDP per capita of all 2/315 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 round.
Low wages have led to a better salary abroad.
The European Central Bank sees the Baltics in full light, and the economy is also growing this year, the local residents are not familiar with anything.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the inhabitants of Latvia and Lithuania assessed that their economies were doing very well or that they were doing well.
In Poland and in Poland, this was thought to be less than half of those who had been questioned.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice dailys in seconds to change the times of the week.
It's almost 11 o'clock when the troupe of the UCLA and the Absorbings are moving to talk at the edge of one of the new training fields in the city.
Some of them have girded their shirts, betraying their sweats from their workouts during the first day of the training session.
A large part of the crew will take a break from this force force force force force at noon.
After three hours of training, the housekeeper will return to the community for a study before returning to the Wassserman and the TV centre at 6.30 a.m. next morning for a meeting.
"The next three days will be a great trial for them," said coach Jim Mora of the Bruins a while before Monday morning.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice-daily trainings for the second time has actually changed their days - at least up to a half-hour on the Friday.
Thus, the first three training sessions of the UCLA were scheduled to begin at 19.15 in order to fit in with the players already in a tight schedule.
The transfer from two to one currency means more than one day at a time - the start of the Bruin Trent Agreement was launched in the previous season almost a month ahead of the previous season and for the first time during the ten years of Mora's six Westwood season, the trades during summer courses take place during summer periods.
They are scheduled to have 18 training sessions until the month of August, before they begin to open for the launch of the Texas A&M in September.
Mora said that she is in favour of the NCAA amendment, although it will add another item to the close shifts of the players on the agenda.
"They have a huge load on three or four days and this is a challenge," Mora said.
"and they'll break through this trial; they'll push, they'll be great.
I believe that when the tail arrives and we have more time, it will be a real pleasure."
Once the camp is over, the UCLA training operations will be closed, which is no easy task, taking into account the clear view of their squares from the parking lot nearby and from the nearby centre of Lukin, the upper class of the hotel that has already got away from the protection net surrounding the entrance post.
This weekend, Bruins players will be staying at the hotel, but Mora admitted that there may be a problem with free rooms during the season.
"We are building security measures," said Mora.
"It is a real concern, and it is not too much to think that people can rent a room and go to workouts.
If you have a transaction from a trade, you can actually make a transaction.
But we'll use security on the parking lot there and on the 8th.
We do our best to use what we have.
I try not to worry about that much.
"We're fine."
In order to pay the compensation to the Central Bank for the birth of Savisaari-Ivanova Union, Kristiina Ojuland and EKRE, who were expelled from the Reform Party, forced to leave the Kristiina Ojuland and the EKR in connection with the merger of Maria Kaljuste forces, we Tallinn and the Partisans to show the potential businessmen's election union in Tallinn - it seems that the launch of the mission in the Party seems that at least as much as the party will participate in the sitting this year.
The chicks, however, will be held in the autumn, and the key will be whether all of them will share sufficiently disappointed voters.
Staying with Savizar?
When the community of support for Edgar Savisari has turned to a small extent, it can be expected that his election union will be honoured by events.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and present general party and many unknown figures - will this be the election union?
Should it be worth noting that some of the Savisar’s loyal followers and cocks are avoiding the application in Tallinn, perhaps it is possible to look for the "Savisar's opinion" of the exhibitors, the front of which is suspected of corruption and corruption crimes, to become a reality?
For the benefit of the Government, the music was sent out to the Russian-speaking populace, which includes the elder of the district of Lasnamäe; and in every sense, the original computer message, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas must avoid the lost tols and squirrels while driving - is that the first vote on the 16- and 17-year-olds allowed to vote in the Electoral elections for the Environment?
We look forward to what other parties have in mind the idea of a public election.
When watching Channel 2 or TV, instead of having fun at the beginning of a month, watch black screen, there are two choices: to accept that no more than ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn, or English-speaking France24 channels will be available for each month's 8th online operators.
There are also those who are initially provocating free television, but at last - albeit in the opposite sense - are paying for the image and the sermons.
The louding of music, the louding of the crowd and the raging trash on the streets are almost every major music shed is an unpleasant phenomenon.
However, if you do not want to get a part of the noise, it is worth going to the country instead of the pain, to leave the village for a decent expense in the place of sleep.
Washington Displaying Card
The media release cites President Donald Trumpi, who said that he is planning a new U.S. immigration plan that will change the rules of the map.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 per year, a more stringent standard for the acquisition of professional visas and a ban on family orientation visas.
The new rules are the Republic and the President's support.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers.
"This law helps poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, how the US delivers green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law reduces immigration and will replace the current programme.
The new application process gives rise to candidates who speak English and who have the means and skills to benefit our economy," Trump said the United States media publications in the United States.
Siberian Setos are moving into the city, the pensioners are returning to the country.
Yvsejevi Anatoli will continue the tradition of the ever-famous Seto gold miners on Earth’s very remote river.
He works at home 140 kilometers from Earth’s extra river in the corner of View as a driver.
It's a hard job: two months without a few days, 12 days, and then just a day and a day.
Over a period of three years, Anatoli has seen gold only once.
"It's a tough time: when you go in, you'll be thoroughly checked not to bring the wine, and then you'll go out and not bring the gold," says Anatoli.
Mare Piho is talking to a local seto Jaan in the village of Haiti, who has told her a lot about his family's memories in Siberia.
Siber’s Setode’s former Arctic culture will also affect home-stops, because it’s just so amazing, I think at the very earliest, the far-away Setoes studied by Piho Mare.
His first study trip to Siberia will take 30 years this year.
During this time, he's been there 14 times and he's been there for a year.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, how many setts emigrated to Siberia in order to gain the land?
This is an unanswered question.
I think it's an eight.
I've calculated it on the basis of the story of Siberian Seto's house, which is also a matter of concern to myself.
It's hard to say, because a group of up to 30 people could have been on it, but the pass was only for a man.
Pass was granted only one, but her husband was married, sisters and other singles.
See how big this place was here.
This was many times more than historical Setomaa.
After all, it had to be educated, somehow consulted.
Setod came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they came into things that were not just about agriculture, but also about the son (painting), gold mines, industry.
For example, in New Bethser, many Setos later went to work in a secret city called Krasnojarsk-i (it was built by the Soviet power of the Uranium Crimes Institute - J. P.), when it was established.
Did the Setos make up the vast majority of the population in this region?
Yes, they lived in compact.
It took a long time to get together and have a lot of hospitality.
Seven or eight families were visible.
How much different is the culture of Siberian cetode and different from that of the domestic cetode?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same thing.
You have brought in a great many people's rites.
So it's the same thing as the people, but they're always the difference between what was in there and what was in here.
Climate change had a serious impact on the dress-up of the Setoes, because it's colder here.
Food changes.
So it's the sordid meat, but it's the same thing here.
Where are the villages of Siberian Setos and what kind of life is living there? / graph: Alari Paluots
The communication with the mother country was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
Looks like it's getting back to Setumaa now, starting to work.
Those girls who are in this family have listened to the stories.
Piho means the son of a delegation of Estonians who, at the beginning of the first week, went to the Day of the Church of Seto in Haiti and lived for four days in their homes - J. P.
What's left here is amazing.
"It is very easy to come and go, for the city is located in the city: at the point of the road and at the intersection of the roads," says Reigo Tamm, an operatist from Koht.
The city has not been just a military capital for a long time, we have plenty of nature, transport and nature and pizza on every corner.
It's a tip-top city!
There is a small island near the river of Kõjoki, which runs through the city, where the killer tends to attend a Janice.
"It doesn't look like this part of the train window," says Reigo.
There's no cold water, you can swim in that river because there's plenty of water in the river.
I'm going to swim there, I'm going to do it.
In addition to the river, you can make a picnic and just make a romance - you can enjoy the flow of the river and think ahead of life and want to.
I'll be there for a walk with my girlfriend.
Apersalist Tamm is on a riverside of three bridges on the other side of the river, and he says, "That this place is by the city, it may not be easy for anyone to resist when a son hears a sound. "
"There is a wonderful view of the Way, but there are also health courses where you can run, ski in winter, and now, for example, play discgolf - golf courses have been made, discs can be rented from the Centre," says Reigo.
Of course, the old pros are out there, but I'm not here to talk yet.
I guess I'll have to ask Rasmus Kull to visit him because he's experienced a discolf player and he's got discs.
- He's got to be. - He's got to be.
Reigo and Mäntmägi are now fundamentals of the ancient generation of operas.
At least during the speaker hours.
There are many tears, disappointments, and you can win in my life.
Not to mention the broken sleeks and skis.
"The whole city is now full of construction work, all of it becomes unknown," says Reigo.
The old and the old stable house is, however, a very good place to play summer games.
I am glad that in 2012 R.A.A.A.M.M. Märt Meos took my lead and came to a stable summer theater with his theatre.
Any of the theatre seasons of last year with "Alexei Karenin" just ended, then on 11 August there will be a "Awake up" at the railway station on 11 August, when the new stable house moves around in Ireland.
"11-13 August is the day of the town of Tapa, in which, after waking up in the dormitory building, the open-house dormitories and events have taken place, including the public rally, have taken place," says Reigo, who is telling him to visit the village that day from those days to those days.
In a little little little little little house, on May 1st, there is a museum already in 1994.
"The house is small, but there is a great deal of information," says Reigo, which is full of the town of Põhja, most of which is focused on science and religion.
Reigo points out that if Tapa's going through all the recommended places, the stomach will soon be empty, but fortunately the small town will be full of coffees.
"We have such good lodgings, and sitting in the cafes sometimes makes you feel like you're abroad," he describes.
Harves and young people The arrival of soldiers spend a lot of time in pubs and cafés, so it is strange to sit there and feel that you are in Estonia and in your own home, but around there there is a community.
I think I would be very pleased to hear the stories of the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, moving a lot of us.
In jail, two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Bulgaria.
On TV, bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in the UK.
On the 1st of February, Sithonia arrested an illegal group of people who had been locked up on the island of Sithonia, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the other day, but now.
The outside said to the television channel bTV that the Bulgarian was released at the latest.
The Greek Prussian Prussia has increased its capacity for free camping and are now imposing heavy fines on all those who are currently missing a place of rest which is not intended to be imposed.
It's going on all the time.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Dogs teach freaks how to break food.
After the break, the Hiaa farmers must again give the wolves a "teach" from their flock - probably the cubs have been taught by the wolves.
Thanks to the centurion of Hiiu's country, three times, a total of 23 sheep and the number of injuries has been broken, Hiiu Leaves.
The number was.
In the context of a conflict of interest, the Environment Agency also has data that last year the Hiiumal were not born in the werewolves, and Hiiuma and the Board of Contracting Parties were informed that this year there were two wolf nests on the site.
On Monday, 15 sheep and 18 other half were injured in the village of Kabuna in the Republic of Emmaste.
On a Saturday morning, the dents of the village of Reheselja broke one of the sheep and seriously injured one of you who had to be killed in the wake of an emergency.
Genetically modified crop management rules must be clear.
The Ministry of Rural Development sent to the co-ordination circle the amendments to the Act on the Placing of Modified Organized Organs (GMOVS) and to the Act on the Protection of Fundamental Rights.
The amendment will exempt both the changed (GM) location from the creation of a separate data set for both the site and both the data collection, hereinafter referred to as the ‘storage’.
The obligation for GM to have a prior agreement with a beekeeper within the prescribed limits is hereby amended.
Currently, there are no modified crops in Estonia that have been modified; we need to combine the existence of clear rules in order to combine the existence of changed and unmodified crops.
As long as it has not been decided to declare Estonia's GMO-free," said Sigmar Kuu, the Department of Plant Health, of the Ministry of Rural Development.
"There is a need to take into account that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative costs for both the private and public sectors", sub-module.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data set and the process for the management of GM agricultural holdings and holdings in GMVS, lays down rules for the management of GM crops and for the management of economic activities.
In particular, with regard to beekeeping, the current obligation of the GM farmer to inform honeybee GM of the obligation to initiate cultivation before the start of cultivation is replaced by the obligation of the beekeeper to agree on a bee before the start of cultivation.
The bill is sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties shall be allowed to consider this in the draft information system and, if necessary, to submit their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Development.
Plan change will affect, in particular, entities in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the farm.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop - MON 810 maize - is authorised for cultivation in Estonia.
In the meantime, none of Estonia's farmers have been interested in cultivation GM.
The reason is that there is no maize pest in Estonia, the European millet for which MON 810 maize is resistant.
Also, the varieties of this mayonnaise are grown in the southern regions, and this is not suitable for our climate.
In 2015 and 2016 the Ministry of Rural Development has commissioned studies to detect possible GMOs in seeds of various varieties of suviraps, maize and soya with GM organisms in Estonia.
The results of the tests carried out showed that seeds did not contain foreign genes, and the study concluded that seeds of growing oilseed rape, maize and soya varieties in Estonia do not contain any modified organisms.
In conclusion, it can be concluded that there is no conscious accumulation of modified crops in Estonia, nor has it been confirmed that there has been any accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Nemanja Matic was recruited by the company as "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic.
Jose Mourinho believes that he has been recruiting Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius" since the night of the mid-switcher Sampdoria hit her debut.
In the last season before the Uefa Super Cup Realidad game in Dublin, the player bought 40 million pounds from Chelsea started a 2-1 win in the first performance on Tuesday, with the impression of a protective team, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on the raids.
While ignoring the season-old Asian fortune of the company, Maticu remained in a desperate match and only lasted 45 minutes, and Mohinho said he had to make sure before the Premier League season was over.
"He won't be long, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a sense of mind," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him if possible."
Like Math, at the Aviva Stadium, other recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romlu Lukaku, and Morinho, began quietly to take place at the beginning of the season.
The Independent made it public this year that Mourinho still wants to capture three and a half men, but he stated that the club has already done "the great work" by concluding contracts with three of his four top priorities.
"I'm grateful to the club that they've given up on the three of the four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make it four to four, but they've been thanking me."
Another parasitic son got on foot on 1st August of the GSM transmitter and this time on Muhu.
The lively bird observer at Mati Martin, the next son of a bitch with the transmitter, was fishing in Sõve, and this nest is already going around, has left the base and joined the Great Night of the World.
Because Sõreves does not have a crop, the Hähte of the Bible says.
On Tuesday, it was too late to call the graves, but there was another wretch boy and this one on Muhu Island.
According to Martin, the installation of transmitters is actually a project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Mullu was equipped with a son of a bitch named Mati GSM transmitter in Sõõves Türül.
"His actions on the Internet are all the way: the way he was going to Spain in the winter, the way he returned to Germany and Poland for a while and then came to Saaremaa," Martinson spoke.
The British inventor had a microchip inserted into his body to access the house and car with hands.
The British inventor became the first country in the country to have a microchip put in, so that he could only open his front door with a handbook, get into the door and even start the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip in his thumb and index finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to make life easier with their technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant at the Royal Hospital of Hampshire County, Hans, Winchester, to ensure that the adjustment procedure is in conformity with the medical standards.
Technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes 30 seconds.
The plant also swaps houses and car locks so that they match the chip, asking for a lock of GBP 300.
This married one child's father has now introduced technology both now and in his own car, called “Z4”, which will start when he's on the move.
The house tour sent thousands of taxpayers to pay for the house.
According to the military documents published in the press, the decision of the High House to launch the Navy mission on the next month for the production of America went to the South Court to pay an amount of about 24,000 dollars to the taxpayer for the purpose of paying the bills for the southern court.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the presidential holding, was the central draw of the event presenting American construction programmes in the United House on 17 July.
Donald Trump, formerly Mike Pence and the High Commissioners of the North House, asked for industrial products from all 50 states on their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with hunting from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift built in Mississippi.
According to the documents of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), who was responsible for operation of the helicopter, the Prime Minister of the House requested, with FARGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the southern courtyard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this, because it is an unusually remarkable event," said the HMX-1 Commander the day before the event in an e-mail to his superior, an officer of the Navy officer in the field of aviation.
The signal indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the south yard at 7 a.m. on 17th of July at 15 a.m., and would remain until the yard was opened at 18 and 21 o'clock on the same day.
It was interesting that if leaving the West House was to be taken, a second ecipas would be needed for the return flight due to the change in working time.
The initial flight crew was on the ground during the mission and the escort security crew stayed outside the aircraft during its stay on the ground.
It could not be excluded from the documents submitted to the magazine whether or not the second ecipas is finally needed.
Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government for property purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 has examined whether this event may be in breach of this provision.
"We asked if it would violate Hatt's law, and we were told that it would not," just Commander.
"You know you don't have a choice," says Deputy Chief Officer.
The House declared the event "made in America" for its official event, and Hatch's law would not have covered it.
But even at a public event, there are religious undertones.
At the time, the President supported the efforts and efforts of the public health administration to maintain the rule of law.
The use of the name ‘One’ or ‘Air Force One’ by the name of the aircraft is not a new phenomenon for the purpose of profit or loss.
They must show courage.
The requirement to use this product as a photosensory is unusual.
At his first campaign event in Florida, Zimbabwe, in the context of the presidential plane, he was reminded that he was in the middle of a meeting, and that his Twitter account was falling out of messages that were complaining about how he was using the President of the Presiding Body.
"The House is very pleased to be "prepared for America", where it is represented by 50 States of all the 50 States that have made up of American materials by American workers," said Lindsay Walters, the spokesperson of the Republic House press.
HMX-1 teams are often being tested in the vicinity of Washington and in the southern court to try to set off at the United States' President's President's House with a centimetre accuracy.
In early July, when Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany, HMX-1 organised a trial at the Court of the First House in the year 58.
According to the official, the flight was considered to be the standard flight path of the flight crew during the last month of the flight.
In the meantime, the Esadear helicopters flew for another 11 hours for "non-presidency support missions".
According to the house, none of the other exhibits of this mission entered the taxpayer's wallet.
According to the Sikorsky representative, the house was not involved in the exercise of an exhibition at the southern court.
HMX-1 does not hold presidential budget documents and the exact cost of the event is difficult to determine.
The compensation rate for VH-3D is 24 380 per hour per financial year of the Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017.
The escort documents marked the flight length of its basic base from its fleet of Lentico aeroplanes in both directions of Virginia for 30 minutes.
The house claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is below this amount.
"The payees' calculation on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very wrong," said Walters.
"These estimates of compensation rates shall include indemnity expenses for staff, maintenance and many other aspects, which shall be taken into account for the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 survey, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, although they cover expenditure related to the service and contract.
Sean Spicer, a former press representative of the building, was protecting at the time when he was using the helicopter.
"The idea is to show up in this America," said Spicer.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very much yelling that they will contribute to our national security and that there are probably hundreds of people, if not thousands of people, that work will make sense.
And I believe that just like one of the Americans, we are all responsible for this box and other military equipment that so many Americans have been tirelessly grateful for.
So it's right to point it out."
I don't know if Trump was in contact with or not, but he was looking for a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump Sikorsky approached him by sending a press release about the products of the company in his personal airspace.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
Grit Šadeiko - through the tears came peace and joy.
In the year 2011, Daegus hit Šadeikot in the last area, 800 m of foot ramp running, and was taken off the stadium with a piece of material.
Immediately before that, he had received a zero in a long-range jump on a universe trip to China.
In 2012 the EMI of Helsinki was killed in a small-scale injury, but at the debut Olympic in London, it received a position of 6013 points 23 at the point.
There was no reason for that to happen.
In 2013, the Moscow MMil in 2013 received a thumb injury in the Estonian long-range jump in the Estonian record schedule after the next day.
Two years later, he got to Beijing in Mil 15, and he was an Olympic standard, but this was more than just a sportsman's wish for disappointment.
The great kadal flag was passed by Shadeko when he didn't get a letter at the beginning when he jumped far away.
I'd just like to put together a single, once-in-a-kind multi-competition.
Once, he confessed to Šadeiko.
The worst was before: a month ago, his Olympic match in Rio ended a first stop due to a trip injury to Rio.
Had to shoot it - do you even want to play with the competition?
- It's a day?
The Neiu thought for a long time, but rested in peace.
I'm gonna have to think about something.
This experience is really hard to describe, but I thought that last season and Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and to think for a while.
"I knew I wasn't gonna put a bag on it yet," she says about her own air-conditioning.
I have to turn the page and move on.
Coach Anne Mägi said that it was very hard to look at the sufferings of the dubious, but he realized that, above all, the athlete had to deal with himself.
After all, he was so dematerialized on all sides.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove what he's worth," says Mägi.
There's some kind of peace in him.
I'm happy for him.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set up 6280 points for the new Estonian record in the Götzise multi-competition.
At a high-level competition, he improved the personal peak in a gunway close to the metre (13.89) and ran into a long-time barrier.
Then the multi-disciplinary felt that it was not the top of any powers, but the first sight was erased.
Mägi, who has taught him for years, says that Shadeiko is a student of mine.
He's a sportsman, he's good at training.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Feels his own feelings and trusts his own feelings.
We need to start with that.
I can't say what to do, and let's do it.
A new approach has also been found by Shadeiko.
"I'm not the one who makes the workouts," he says, and says, "the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The baby-sniff of close friends makes you happy.
Good emotions have also offered to Shadeiko the happiness of those close to him.
His other co-worker, Mägi Mägi and sister Grete, have recently become parents, and the multi-competitors have received support from the new world.
"It's been interesting," says Shadiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equal to the "tearing" of the brain.
He says that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is still such a big wine fan that he believes - wine can be trained in the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a research scientist at Yle University.
In his words, it's not about alcohol or how it can express our feelings, it's about the "very good" eating process.
By smelling glass, rolling in the mouth, enjoying it and smelling the aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for it.
According to Sheperd, the animal molecules do not actually contain taste, only the taste of the way the wine brain stimulates the brain.
He's trying to fix the brain.
"Flavour is not in the wine, it creates a taste," says Sheperd.
The things that affect the formation of more wine taste are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount that man produces.
Heperd says that wine is not for you to get drunk.
"In fact, it's got to be more than that.
If you take too much joy, the system will be overcrowded.
Too much wine can hurt the brain - according to 2004 the people who drink more than three shots of food, their loss, their loss of balance, and their ability to breathe.
10% of households in the European Union
The data in the font of the personal search company request that 10% of the employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive a lower salary than those in the population.

According to the United Nations, the role of Afghan democracy in politics
The UN Mission Commander seriously said that the elections can represent the population only if all the members of the society, including, play a role in them.
The Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission, Nicholas Haysom, said that hundreds of women were candidates in the Councils, candidates were candidates for Vice-President, and more than 30 percent of the recent voters were women.
"The importance of emphasising the role of women cannot be exaggerated," he said in his third statement.
The election can only be justified and credible if it is fully involved and is part of the discussion process at all stages.
The elections and presidential elections of the Afghan Councils will take place on 5 April.
For its part, Thailand has failed the discussion process, which will coincide with the transition period when the role of a military operation becomes acceptable.
The decrees of the year mean that the power is given in peace from one of the most eminent government.
Haysomi said that women contribute strongly to the democratic success of Afghanistan.
According to the Universal Collection Commission, 3.6 million of the registered voters have 1.2 million.
Sharing will make everything more fun of both the big ones and the big ones.
There's always too little time, but the practice with the son-in-law is good to combine the association, the proximity, and the load.
And what a comfortable solution - wherever you scratched in the summer, the living hants will always come along and remind you of their fine little voice: "Let's do this practice!"
Start-warming - it is very good to watch a cockroach or to play along the bar.
The lake is the base of the feet and the ashtrays - who would like to create a sandbox washed from the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use it instead!

From the Philippines to the wide world, the journey of the shoulder bag to the hearts of fashion fans is a journey from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans.
Sacked bags are a summer classic, which has become its own product during the last few years, which at one time must hang on the hand of a summer talker, and which has been known by the exporters to extract a price tag from its humble origin.
A bloated bag is one of the things that has existed once in a while and that has not created any special emotions.
It's just, it's not, it's not.
Now, however, baggies are making a real victory and fashion fans have changed their fine plastic bags for the summer month for a simple, shaved eagle.
This is not only about the beach, but it is thanks to the fact that it is just as popular as a tower, and the first ones are even walking to the top.
However, it should first be made clear here whether a summer story like this sits on the top of the head or whether it is worth the wet and the laptop to be added to the last bit.
Break-ups have made women's love for the summer.
For example, when you read about foreign fashions, the first thing you can see is that fashionable travels are going to the local market as the first thing on a trip and buy a sidekick, what is the whole holiday story and what it's going to do to be like to hang out on the beach, on the market, and on a town with friends.
The bonnets are so generous that they buy a lot more money from the market and sell or don't give it to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that among the readers the demand for eagles is so great that in the real world the mother (and the husband!) would go to one another on hand to become the owner of some cup of happiness.
In many senses, that is also true of madness, because it is rare that these are once in a modern world when it is possible to think of some of the things in a creed for a few tens of euros.
True, smart traders have also discovered a simple money offer here and thus buys a few hundred and thousands of euros for a smaller luxury brand of olive bags.
I mean, it's true that the poor ones shouldn't feel like they're just a bunch of freaks who're trying to make fun of some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a Dolce & Gabba for over a thousand euros-dollar utility bag.
However, for the interpretation of the committee’s own home, a total of 6000 euro could be used.
Most of the Mochats, however, do not come from any of the great fashionable bags, but from their story far more recently.
It's supposed to be from far away from the Filipinos, where they come from.
In particular, the rooting of the shoulder bag is not very often seen by the explorer and the locals.
It is claimed that it dates from the 14th century and is quite similar to the fall of a basket.
However, while the shoulder bag does not have to grow as hard as a basket, they can be embedded in patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and thus more effective.
For example, recently, there have been particularly platy bags with colored ribbons or leather bands embedded in them.
In particular, the book may be sent to the actress Jane Birkin, who had not been foreseen to receive all the help bags.
He was supposed to fit his shoulder bag into all kinds of kits, and he didn't have to go to Cannes's gun.
In the popularity of the bags today, however, it is no less important that care for them is the head of the head, and it is not necessary to maintain them with any other special tools, but it is also the water and wet towel.
As in the case of fluctuation, apart from the classic appearance of a new brand, the brand is produced with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you want to, you can get yourself a strawed ridge or a tiny shoulder bag.
However, it should be borne in mind that the classic bag never goes from fashion to style, quite often.
What, then, is a classic handbag?
For centuries, the classic is a bag made of one of those shoulders, which resembles its styling basket, is open and it is thin, as well as shoulders, Sanga.

Minimaism from the needle-eyed eye - detailed home prepared for home
A home with a golden deficiency in the home of a household in the city of Tammä.
The woman is building a house - instead of a functional home in the garden house.
The son of a man who was on Earth a day ago was put to death.
The treasure left the other night to inform of its home in Kärla's suburbs.
There was a last contact last night, Friday night, and the positioning gave the man a location in the West Islands, in the village of Minnus, where he was searched for with a helicopter until the evening and with a dog until early in the morning.
Then his phone went dead, and his husband's location could no longer be identified.
Continued the search this afternoon.
Thank you all who contributed to finding the treasure.
GMB is concerned about the conversion of the company McVitie's Glasgow to the factory.
The World Trade Organization is looking forward to the confirmation of the long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant by the producer McVitie.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has kept silent about Tollcross's object investment in the future.
In a factory where Hobnobs and Rich Information are produced, as well as more than 500 people, work at a factory that employs more than one 500 people.
The McVitie's owner at the platform said that they have moved over 5 million pounds over the last few years.
It was called upon to employ employees and trade union presidents to "be the first to hear", if anything changes the way the factory works.
A letter addressed to the host host addressed to the GMB Scotland company McVitie's addressed a request "to raise concerns about the fact that the funds are not used to upgrade the production lines".
The GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot become clear from the head of the object about Tollcross's business needs and investment position is of great concern to our members.
There have been several generations of work, and the work consists of a local community and the peoples of Glasgow, who have always been in a position to support decent employment in an area where there is a high level of unemployment and social poverty.
Therefore, Glasgow needs a company with increasing productivity in McVitie, with increasing productivity in the back of the eastern part of the job, employment and well-being, and in the context of the rise in the cost of living and the chronic change in production of Brexit."
The record representative said: "The head of the Tollcross unit received a letter from the GMB Scotsale just yesterday, and the company is giving it a direct message, as we value a lot of communication with the employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting between the Tollcross employees and GMB representatives took place a month ago, discussing a number of issues.
We then discussed with the employees that everything else in the most competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities - and this applies to all of us - in order to ensure our identity.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over GBP 5 million in the Tollcross object, most of it being in the line of business and in the improvement of operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site and, if any change occurs in the activity of the object, the employee and trade union representatives are the first to hear about it."
Did the PSG warn the pig about Neymmal's departure three years ago?
Lala may regret her interest in Marco Verrati.
Paris Saint-Germain does not attempt to lure Neymar into his ranks by offering him £1 million to buy out. But did they warn Barcelona three years ago for this last tour?
This enchanting approach has opened the summer window, and the Ligue 1 club is ready to crush more than twice the current world record of the buy-in, which was placed last season on the return of Paul Pogba to , for £89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will be the world's most valuable player and, at all, the highest prized professional sport in the world, which will be paid by the PSG for over 50,000 pounds per week.
Barcelona is, of course, angry at both the approach and the break-in of Neymar, although a close source to the Catalans service suggests that the player has always taken care of the best care of the player since he left Santo in 2013.
But did the PSG President warn the world of football three years ago about such a suggestion?
If the City is interested in signing a contract with Blaise Matuid this year, Nasser Al-Khelaif was harshly talking about recruiting a P.S.G. Player.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they're playing our game, we're gonna stand up and let them play," said Al-Khelaif.
"We love all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with any of our players, they must face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line, since the Spanish club was concerned earlier this summer about the PSG's central editor Marco Verratt.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition, and that La may come back as a result of this interest by losing one of their dear treasures in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexit is seriously threatened by a glaring between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," warned the Varadkar at his first visit to Northern Ireland in June after his appointment.
"I can't imagine what it's worth," he.
External investment projects made it possible for the free movement of today's worlds and goods," said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not boundaries," he stressed.
For example, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union, and that he would not be able to remain part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
The other way to change the change would be the creation of the European Union and the United Kingdom's customs union, explained the Irish Prime Minister.
Marking that this agreement existed with Turkey, the Varadkar said: "We could be sure to have this kind of sterling."
Alternatively, it would be a return to the points of duty that would declare historical division and failure.
"A barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that the result could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
In his first semi-prolonged triathlon passed the Mart Certificate: The Ironman is passing through everyone.
