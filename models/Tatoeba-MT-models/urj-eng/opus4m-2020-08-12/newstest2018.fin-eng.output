Camille Auer wanted her sex, was diagnosed with mental illness, and now she's doing art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body".
From the roof of the project room gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts, there are hidden data reports hanging from the archives.
Each entry contains the name of Camille Auer.
Papers tell the story of how all the worlds have learned their interpretations of Auer and this day.
He's the one who decided.
"I wanted to report a person in my immediate medical history so that the process would become a reality," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a long-term investigation period involving meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process begins with a "sex identity disorder" diagnostic study to be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
For Auer, the process took place four years ago.
before this, he was now a estrogen in his home country and was in a very long time in his own repair process.
He is a man, but according to the law of the word of the word, he must go through the process of counseling, so that he can also be repaired legally.
The Act, i.e. the Act of Transsec male sex (563/2002), obliges transgender people to be forced to commit themselves to the right justice in order to obtain, for example, a population centre and passport.
At present, each authority requires a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of incontinence.
Man has the right to decide for himself.
"This situation is intolerable and threatening," says Auer.
The reform of the Transaction has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The UN Council of the European Union has given eight observations and there is a preliminary ruling before the Court of Justice of the European Union, which obliges the parties to the Treaty on European Union to exercise the right to exercise their rights of power.
The previous Finnish Government prepared a change of law under the leadership of the then Minister of Social Affairs and Health Susanne Huovinen.
The elections and the Common Finns are returning to the government.
Now that the law has changed, it's stuck again.
It is an internal political dispute that does not even concern this law.
"The government does not want to bring it up at the table because there are differences between the inside and the inside," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of the Department of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the venue is dominated by two major installations.
One of these consists of the packs and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient-reporting installation, any visitor can, for example, refer to the interpretation of the dictionary of the Transpolis psychologist at the University Hospital in Auer.
A psychologist met with Camille Auer twice, and based on these, he wrote a report that should identify Auer's legal treatment and assistance.
The mind of the universe of the investigation appears to be exposed to shock.
The concept of self-prudentialism appears in a framed manner at the border level, and personality-related unstable features are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed with madness," Auer says.
There was an even greater shock when Auer was not granted gender correction treatment.
According to the nursing staff, his capacity was not sufficient to complete the process.
He was denied his own identity.
February 11, 2015 Auer walked home from meeting him and kicked the transpole's wait room around.
Later that television created a work of art called the Monument for the Exclusive, where Auer refleles about power and how to do it.
"It's crazy that any woman-made world in the mind can grow its breasts, but it takes a diagnosis to remove the breasts," says Auer.
Your body is not yours if you experience anything other than your sex.
Auer's performance is, of course, not the only one.
The gender correction process is for many reasons of the greatest spiritual nature than purely because of what is done.
It goes through many people who need to reason their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of assistance and assistance are denied care, claiming that their resources are not sufficient," Auer says.
Those who have applied for many processes have the same psychological frequency: depression, anxiety, severe bullying experiences.
On this basis, the maintenance staff may prescribe that treatment cannot be initiated.
"The prevention of treatment and assistance may push man into a worse situation than it was before the start of the process," Auer says.
Aauri's personal display also deals with anxiety and thoughts about suicide.
In the section release, Auer writes: "I have had suicidal thoughts throughout my adult life and that's what it's usually like to talk about."
The depression has been treated with drugs, and when Auer started to produce hormones, it made it easier for him to live.
He had actually been able to express the feelings that existed in his childhood and in his teens.
Why the wide jaw did not feel appropriate to its own body, and why the breasts should not be gentle instead of flat.
The most important thing for Auer is that he is close to him, who is next to him.
Being able to see is a basic need.
"There is now so much reason to speak, be quiet, be voiced and move," he says.
Auer is now experiencing a future sight, he is a woman.
In the early days of the process, however, close random comments may have hurt a lot.
The most painful thing is when people close to you are the wrong people.
"They should know and they should know who I am, but they will not or will not be able to inside it," he continues.
Not all transiters need physical change.
They do not give birth to dysphoria, i.e. conflict of mind, or parts of the body, can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, the use of hormones and the long research process cannot be officially supported on their part.
"There is no specific basis for these studies," Auer says.
And it's true.
In this case, in January 2014, Parliament adopted a new legal recognition procedure for legal relations.
The legislation is based on the right of autonomy in legal relations.
A full-time applicant makes a first application for a new identity card on it for a second time.
After a six-month period of consideration, the applicant shall confirm its announcements in writing and the Ministry shall provide the applicant with a new identity.
In addition, Finland and this requirement are also covered by the Auer exhibition.
It has not been an artist's therapeutic experience, but an art and art collection.
I believe that art is still real and that it can help to bring about changes in the time when politicians have been promoting human rights.

The air force created a travel alert for Missouri.
The Afro-American civil rights organisation NAACP has issued a travel alert for Missouri, which is the result of discriminatory practices in the state and racist attacks there.
"The travel information for NAP Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and will call on African tourists, visitors and locals to pay close attention to and to observe the extreme prospect of travelling in a state where there have been a number of events based on race," says the Organization's information.
The law in force at Missouri makes it difficult to export cases of discrimination, and the enforcement of state laws is disproportionate to minorities. According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"People's rights are being violated.
They will be killed or killed on the basis of the colour of their skin," said Rod Chapel, President of the NAAH Missouri, to the Kansas City Star magazine.
"We've never heard of one incident before at the same time."
The travel information about Missouri is the first US destination.
The article mentioned examples of racist comments against African students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tory Saders from Tennessee.
He was driving the world when his car ran out of fuel. Missouri's police arrested him, of course he wasn't charged with the crime.
The travel information also referred to the report by the Minister of Justice of Missouri that 75% of the black driver is likely to be stopped by the police.
"The purpose of the travel information notice is to encourage people to be alert and to guess their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," says Bapel.
"For example, people must prepare for money to pay guarantees, or once to families, for example, that they intend to travel through the United States."
According to the FBI, in 2015 in Missouri, a hundred hate crimes or fourteenth of the United States were recorded in the United States.
Travel alerts are also an answer to Missouri's new law, which hampers access to the right of access to business in housing and employment.
The ACLU, which was guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after they had adopted immigration laws that force people to be arrested for immigration offences, which is often more racially-based profiling.
The main travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and they concern other countries. However, in recent times, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä lä Finnair’s report on the Executive Director’s additional pension pension.
Minister for Owner Management Mika Lintilä (medium) has asked Finnair for a report on the additional contribution received by Pekka Vauramo, CEO of the company, Yle.
According to the Minister, it is, on the contrary, a state of religion.
The EUR 130,000 additional pension received by Vauramon was raised this time when the Presidents announced the development of the remuneration of directors of listed companies.
The magazine announced Vasaram's additional pension here.
Finnair told me that he was going to give up further pensions this year in 2013.
The government has argued that no additional pensions will be used for remuneration.
More than half of the state owns Finnair.
According to all of them, the decision is in line with last year's principle of in-house guidance.
Packages toughened up the speeches right away.
One second ago, it seemed that the relations between the United States and Russia were on their way out of the cold.
In the context of the G20 meeting of the developing countries in Hamburg, the United States President Donald Trump and President Vladimir Putin seem to be looking forward to coming together.
Since then, the atmosphere has become colder than ever before.
The new economic sanctions that the United States adopted last week and the new economic sanctions that they met on Wednesday were dealt with in a bitter way.
The most pompous answer has now been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, according to which the Refugee Act concluded by Trump means "perfect trade war".
Even if the interactions were to be considered as mere pressure and overruns of political rhetoric, the tightening of the United States and the United States after the short month of Trump's choice is the fact that the gap between the United States and the United States has been tightened up since the month after the month in which Trump was elected.
It was not easy to pass through the sanctions for the United States, Iran and North Korea.
The Congress did not agree with the law, but it was much easier, according to what has been said, to pass the law to the President.
As a result, Trump criticises the law of its country of origin, which is "definitely incomplete".
I believe that Mr Trump's behaviour must have been the result of the adoption of a law restricting his own rights, even though it must have been an insult to him.
As is well known, the United States is taking place as far as possible of any involvement in the presidential elections as is the case with the Trump campaign's nuclear connections.
Indeed, the tightening of the United States and the United States is after the sixth month of the wake.
The staff of the House of the House of the Arts has changed rapidly and various scandalous versions have been revealed almost, and it seems more and more obvious that the foreign policy is not doing under the leadership of the President of the United States but in spite of the campaign.
The situation is absolutely not desirable.
If the relationship between Russia and the United States is bitter, the same applies to the European Union as well.
In addition to political sanctions, tensioned security in the Union's nuclear region in the Baltic Sea will also tighten up relations.
The EU has apparently maintained the situation in Ukraine in its relations with Russia and called for the implementation of the Minsk Treaty.
For the time being, the Union has remained at least in the same direction in its foreign policy, and the interests of the Member States are quite different.
To a Member State such as Russia, which makes a lot of trade with Finland, economic sanctions have been a real pain in the ass.
The sanctions adopted by the Commission are still unclear.
In the EU, it has been feared that sanctions will make it more difficult for many public authorities to operate.
For example, in the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima power plant project.
The problem with acidification in Europe is that sanctions have been excluded, for example, for the economy, the high level of liquid natural gas.
The political packages are the way in which the world’s way of exerting an aggravation.
However, political sanctions must be very well thought-out and precise.
Other things are more than easy for others.
Is that all it's about?
The Most High House is now in the middle of the second pillar.
Absence of the statues is the most secure force for change of power.
Americans know as well as others: the Iraqis fell together with the American soldiers at the image of Saddam Hussein in Firios's favour this year.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of the Trump administration, I know well what was going on in a heated debate with CNN Jim Acosta.
Vincent didn't really judge the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have caught a huge bunch of cruisers and characters sucking from the image of The Truth.
The object of his attack was the importance of the statue, and in particular the fact that in 1903 Emma Lazarus' poem was added to the statue's base after 17 years of completion of the statue.
Mr. Acosta said: "I do not want to go to it in more detail in history, but the image of the Truth is... a symbol of the symbol of the world-wide enlightening America.
The poem was later added, and it is not part of the original Statue of the Spirit."
The mill was not in itself wrong, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
The touching words of Lazarus, the only quality in which the state not only calls for "the poor" but also for "the poorest", are: "You tired, your youth, / Your hiddled masses yearning to breake free, / The wretched reaction of your teming sshore."
The poem is now more modern than ever.
Mr. Miller did not cast any literary criticism, and he made it clear that the poor are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The dispute over the meaning of the Truth is part of the wider world and cultural dispute over the meaning of the United States.
Lazarus's friends, after his knowledge, campaigned for the poem to be fitted with a statue from its foot, and they know well that it was a strong act.
The aim of the statue was to express the relations between the public and the United States of America with a classic symbol, a woman's physicality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of that: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives a new name: deported mother.
The movement of the poem into the image was a brilliant feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on the nation's ideas.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long to change it back to its originality.
Rurh Limbaugh – a guide that can now be regarded as some kind of indicator of the Trump – in 2010 that the verb is not called, but is an early pioneer of the New Conservatives, which will lead the United States to cover the world of darkness: "Lady Liberty will come forward.
He's taking fire from the United States to the rest of the world.
The phone does not show the way to the United States."
Of course, Limbaugh was right.
The meaning of freedom is entirely fundamental.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but desirable immigrants on board the ship for a long and trying journey.
Its protection and the better life for those looking for it.
His image of truth comforts by giving hope and welcome.
And that's what Jor and Trump don't really want.
Their people don't see the way, they're looking at the flames of anger, their only power.
Publicly Sporting World Championships 2017: Neil > commends the British national team to Scottish members of the Scottish team.
Nolith Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots of the main British national team will remember.
Neil Black, President of the United Kingdom's General Sport Union, says that 16 Scottish members of the World Cup World Cup are "a major confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the public sports World Championships starting in London on Friday.
According to Black, Scotland has something to learn about.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it so long as we understand what is going on," Black says.
"I talked to representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they thought it had something to do with the Institute's activities.
In Scotland’s general public, however, believes that it is linked to business,
and British public sport is killed by the fact that their actions are behind it.
And an ordinary streetman thinks that you have to have something to do with it.
However, it is something really great, whatever it is."
In London, many Scottish athletes really compete for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah on a 5,000-metre run.
"Eilth is rather modest.
His speech was incredible," Black says.
"Certains left the opportunity proudly for their achievements and strongly motivated wherever they happen to live and practice.
Eilish was in fact a real feeling and passion for sport."
Eilih Doyle is the silver medal of the National Community Championships in the 400-metre doorway, and these are his fifth world championship, and he thinks it's "unbelievably" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The previous record was seven years from 198 and 2015.
The biggest runner Laura Muir has been running two British and two European records over the course of the year.
He's in a race in London at 1 500 meters and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs in London in 1500. He also needs to keep in mind: he has an excellent season behind him, including winnings at the UK World Cup and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Cup, when the only Scots in the country were Lee McConnell.
The country leader says he's a "supervisor" for having so many Scots involved, some of which really compete for finals and medals.
"Access is something of a great honor, but more specifically, because the members of the national team voted in favour," Doyle says.
"I am, of course, very sorry for all the Scots who entered the national team.
That's it, we've got it.
They are part of a prestigious athlete who competes for prize-holders.
What's my speech?
I'm fine.
I focused on how lucky we were to have a home race.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home audience and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I'll give you another chance to be there, and I know that the atmosphere will be amazingly bright."
Obstruction of reviewers on Facebook: Do not stand up for public office if you cannot stand the criticism.
Our father knew what was bad publicity.
The Americans turned to George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him of all possible domestic affairs, always on his political principles.
All of them did,
and he did not silence his critics.
"If the reality of the speech is lost, we may be led foolishly and silently as sheep for slaughter," in January 17th.
We are from here to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff have removed at least a 999 comment from his official Facebook page and prevented the authors from doing so.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union challenged Hogan last time this year.
His staff consider the challenge to be unfounded, and the attitude was also negligible on the network.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook," many comments.
It's a matter of importance,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican Governor of the Empire of the Democratic Empire.
He has made the most of the 50 governors of his activity.
Hogan is not sensitive to the hot one.
He is the first to be solid in the state and has adhered to the principles in advance.
He has also expressed his condolences to Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and published a picture of his bald head in chemotherapy.
Therefore, the prevention of users entering the Governor's Facebook page is essential and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and open forum that he/she manages with tax resources.
Mr. Hogan's informant, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions in his interview with Washington Post.
However, the labelling of the Commissioners as trolls, hot dogs or traitors is too easy to understand.
Washington Post interviewed users who were prevented by Hogan on Facebook.
They proved themselves to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not drivers, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me that their comments were respectful, kind and factual.
The branch borrowed a comment from the Bible; he wanted to bet on Hogan's Catholic faith.
Advocate General Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowi was not hostile but raised a question about hate crimes.
"I was very pleased that Hogan had not been allowed to stand up for the crimes and recent news," he wrote in Washington Post's comments.
"I am also unable to accept that, when you comment on the same thing, you will be treated in any way as an organised group and as a large group of concerned citizens."
The governor's staff called comments "intervention". Another might call them "the most important things".
It is easy to control the communication of the day-to-day era by preventing a reviewer or by removing a critical comment.
The old one should have sent staff to seek and send out newspapers containing one of the critical manuscripts, or to arrest and silence protestors.
In fact, it's the same thing, but it's only a matter of consciousness right now.
Hogan is not the first official to be charged with combining Facebook and other social media channels.
He has been challenged by the users of information that prevents Trumpi from doing so.
Opinion on the first important decision last month in Virginia.
According to President James C. Cacheris, the President of the District Council of Loudoun broke the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution in order to open the vote on the Internet.
And the U.S. Citizens' Rights Union held a debate with the Republican Governor of Kentucky Matt Bevin on the use of Twitter and Facebook.
It shouldn't be easy.
At the time, the cost of postal charges had the same effect as today's internet.
The number of newspapers doubled since 17th to 1800, and anonymous writers were muttering Washington.
There were trolls back then.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisaarius and Portius wrote in letters asking for decisions in Washington.
The President's office received petitions for criticism of the Jay Agreement, i.e. between the United States and the United States of America, for cooperation, trade and shipping, which is reflected in the documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critic.
Freedom of expression, freedom of expression and freedom of expression are the basic stones of our nation.
Real leadership means the adoption of this fact.
The summer food of birds should be immediately immediately immediately.
These results have come from half the place, and also from the number of online notifications, from three to half.
Most of them have come from South and South Finland, but then also from Haapavesi and Seinäjoki, Special Researcher Marja Gösmursu from Evira.
Green larvae have died of a parasite called tricomonosis.
It is written in a letter called Trichomonas gallinae from the beginning of the animal.
It has previously been known to doves, and they are known to dove.
However, in the 21st century, there was also a start in the pep police.
In 2009 it was a good start.
The result of the tricomonosis of Finland's green-peeled stock is a major attack, after which the species' stocks have been in a state of recovery.
Hospitals have now been, but at least not yet in great measure, the Hungarian master Juha Honhala speaks to the city of Helsinki, the city of Luomus.
It is feared that the last episode of green beads will be repeated again if something does not happen.
What needs to be done now is a very real thing that can be done all the time: stop eating birds' summer food immediately.
I'll see you later.
Rona Rafferty hopes to benefit from the home field advantage at the Renaissance Club.
The former European top player, Roan Raffferty, wishes to receive his home field representation for the next three days, when the Renaissance Square in East Poland will host the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament.
Last year, the Irish Raffferty in Northern Ireland held a tournament at Archerfield Links before the last round but finally lost to Paul Eales. Raffferty has enjoyed a new location and is acting on behalf of the founder and CEO of the tournament, Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will allow it to reach its full-blown glory," says Rafferty.
"The players will see the field at its best.
Jerry has worked hard with this place.
He's an enthusiastic ambassador to the game, and he's in the middle of the day here.
The tournament is the main event for this field."
The second Eales defends the title for the first time, although he has won his 32-year career for both the European tour and the European challenger tour.
"This looks like a really different event," says the player in Southport.
"I will not deny the victory of Extremadura Open, because the tournament is not part of this year's tour.
It's safe to come back here.
This is a great place for golf.
The last year comes back to me: winning the tournament was a thing for me and my wife, Sharon.
It was a long time that we would always remember."
Gary Orr will be back in real life on his own, and he entered the tour last year after he completed his 50th year in the past year.
This is her first performance in Scotland since 2013 Aerdeen Asset Τ Scottish Open tournament.
"Being at home is always more meaningful than usual," says Orr., who lives in Helensburgh.
"You want to succeed, and you also feel extra pressure.
I've been enjoying it again and I've been playing pretty hard.
I'm happy with my session so far."
Three will be followed by Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
The tournament will be attended by two Scots: Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
Parking a car costs five pounds if the car has only a driver and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.

In the view, the indoor airways of the camp are discovered in the atmosphere of the island.
In Sälä, the P.P.I.'s communion staff has not been able to find indoor air for at least the moment, and the P.I. was told on Thursday.
External immigration is still ongoing.
The clarifications were made when the man who asked for the public reasons of his civil service assumed that his health had been weakened by the bad indoors of the barracks.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, Chief of Staff of the PG, there are no problems with the health situation of other officials.
It is evident that this was a single occasion and that no other servant of this unit has had any health problems.
Every announcement is taken seriously and we tried to find out this matter thoroughly.
At present, it is not known that we have any indoor air conditions, says Holma.
Prijet's newsletter states that due to the arrival of the deadline, goods must be moved to the barracks, which is why dust may have been present in the moment.
The weather may therefore seem to be a bit of a pain in the ass, Holma says.
Poverty and poverty in Indonesia's country of origin.
Bardina Degei does not use the tenderness of his cooking.
All he does is use it very often.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the region of Pania, located in the restless province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares the day, he usually puts a sweet – locally "nota" – directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, a burned-up bata will be greedyly eaten with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Dei's home, and he sits in some kind of underground, where he usually also does his daily chores, such as in the dark water that he was looking for from a nearby swamp.
The office of duty will deliver the bucket in the missing room.
Dei is his youngest husband of four wives, and he is not meant to be treated with fields.
Movies are here all the time.
Working late may be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drink a lot.
"No one walks around after five nights," Degei says.
This is only a peeking at the daily Papua highlands in the former Dutch province, which was attached to Indonesia in 1969. The addition was preceded by a controversial referendum in which the 1 0 to 26 village was forced to vote publicly in the face of the occupation forces.
The local independence that opposed the Dutch power quickly turned its anger over to the Jakarta government, which is holding the region firmly under its control and preventing foreign workers and civil servants from access.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed to Papua and West Papua, the eastern part of which belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and a quarter. The journey will begin in an hour and a half from the province's capital, Jayaba, to Nabire, and return to the ground on a bent five-hour drive on a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
Some 19 000 inhabitants in the city have a broad range of shortcomings in the bamboo basins, which have been dyed by nuggets of nuggets.
Few Indonesians are here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
The arrival of early Christian missionaries was worshiped by the Mee Pago tribes of Papua, Uga Tamee.
Some changes have taken place.
"We didn't have any clothes", Degei says. He means a colorful, hand-woven spinning head, dark skirt and a bright-colored sweater.
"And we had nothing more than a bunch of pebbles covered in our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, 28% of its inhabitants live below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in the United States.
But it is also the native of Indonesia.
Panyama is about the size of New Taiwan, with 153 000 inhabitants, only about a hundred kilometers from Panyania is Grasberg, the world's largest and most famous gold mine, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in the United States of America.
In 2015, Freeport received 3,1 billion sixths of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, there are approximately $78 billion of wood on the beans.
However, these waves bring misery to the Pahua, for they mean the repressive existence of a strong Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport provided the local staff and the local units with some 20 million in 1998-2004.
Pappa's demands for a major right of self-determination threaten this source of income, and they remain silent.
According to human rights activists, Indonesia has, since 1969, killed more than 50,000 Papuan laws and accused, tortured and insinuated thousands of people.
According to the European Commission on Human Rights, the mass deaths in the highlands of the Papua tribes in the 1970s have reached the proportions of genocide.
Last year, the Indonesian police arrested over 3 000 people in peaceful demonstrations in the area.
In the report of the British Archeology, We Will Lose Everything in 2016, reports on the brutalities of the last year, such as executions without prosecution, torture — rape and electric attacks are particularly popular means — and ruthless attacks against peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of people because there are cases on a weekly basis," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
Roulettes have been tightened up when Papua’s natural resources attract others from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 1.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83 per cent are Christians, but the population is changing as the rich people of Indonesia move Muslims to the region in the hope of a better income for the island of Jaava, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Javale warang restaurants sell roasted chicken and gado-gado-gado-gado-gado-hatting on the farm.
All of them are really in place.
"The shifters have started to grow chicken and vegetables on the market lower than the locals," says Abeth You, 24-year-old, who came from Pania and moved to the province's head in your work.
"The locals went nowhere."
President of Indonesia, Yoko Widododo – at least Jokowi – promised to intervene in his 2014 campaign in Papua’s injustice and national crimes.
Papa consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on his way to the capital of Jakarta.
But only a little has changed on the Bean, and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts broke because we voted for Yokowi in 2014 and we hoped that he would fulfill our wishes and restore justice," you will say.
There was a kind of wave base in the bank only two months after the October inception of Yokowa.
Eleven children were giggling Christmas songs by the fire in Enarotal on 7.12.12, when two Indonesian soldiers died of the dark on motorcycles.
Scared people told the soldiers I should use the driving lights.
According to the new Reverend Yavett Tebai, the man returned to his place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and the Witnesses, drunk cops grabbed them and assaulted them by beating them with rifles.
That's how one of the soldiers shot at the kid.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma as a result of assault.
A few hours later, the building of the National Electoral Commission near the site was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
There were about a thousand Papulans — young men and women and children — gathered at the main square for a local police station and for a military commanding officer to claim justice.
They had hunting springs to spend their holidays, and they used to make the traditional waita-tance of the Papua Mee Pago, where we're going to sit around and repeat the song of birds.
Participants were trying to stone the buildings of both the house and the mind.
When the atmosphere is hot, the police in the internal radio said: "If people resist more than three times, shoot the dead." The information is based on a public document, which is not published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto region, sneezed the situation out of hand and asked the force to calm down and return to their homes.
No one wants to see you again.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told Time magazine about his painted wood house as a bright color.
Kamame still doesn't know who shot the gun, but the bullet was fired from the soldiers' ranks.
"A number of shots were fired at the launch."
Alfius Youi was shot once, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was really him," he told Yohanes TIME, sad. Many Indonesians saw him just looking at you.
"I saw that he was a dead man... "I kissed him."
Papa's police inspector Yotje Mende told journalists that the police were just protecting the police station because it was under attack.
"We must stand up for the threat of killing us," Pappy police informant Pudjo Sulstiyo in 2015.
"It's about the question and the death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The following day the data came to Jakara.
later, Jokowi gave an emotional speech in Yayaba, where he expressed his condolences to the victims' families and promised to address the protests in Papua.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it is not the same again."
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was going to launch investigations into the courts outside the legal system.
But he's trying to take off his speech.
"The majority of the offenses then,
The 1990s and the 21st century.
The most important thing is that we have decided to investigate the crimes, but it requires certain processes," he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta, 5.6.2017 Wiranto was already in his mind, and he said that he was not going to start the studies with the Papa.
"They're all gonna find out in court," she said.
Convicted Wiranto for "crime against humanity." Crimes related to over a thousand deaths in East Timor's bloody independent vote in the year 1999 Wiranto told the TIME that 11 cases have already been reported on the killings of Papua, including the events in Pania, have already been reported.
The families of the victims are opposed to the issues with a feeling of disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not gone any further", Yohanes says.
"I've already come to this."
He's still alive in fear, even though there's been another event.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the police will arrest me.
His brother Yacob confirms that the Panics do not dare to discuss the event.
He says that the police had beaten him after he had helped him bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after burying the victim," he says.
There is no end to the ammo.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian gunfired in the village of Pania, in the neighbourhood of Deiya, in Deiya.
One and 17 were injured in a conflict between the villagers and the director of the building, which began when he refused to lose his mind at the loss of the man in the hospital.
The man in need of hospital was 24 years old, Mr. Ravinus Douw, who had been caught in the water while he was fishing on a nearby river.
The angry villagers showed their minds at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the report, the Russians stoned the police officers who responded to the fires.
According to home, however, the Indonesian military police unit opened fire on the force, killing one of the villagers.
"We're terrified of revenge," says 29-year-old Domininggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded brought to the treatment.
"I'm hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots to be fired by police officers responsible and the removal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Panama has always been the Prime Minister of Indonesia.
The real lack of development feeds the insatiability of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the wheaty midlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Revolutionary Movement (OPM), the army of rebels who claim to defend the rights of the bean against accidental attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army soldiers.
The OPM leader is Panias, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to the rebellion by arbitrarily holding back and willing thousands of people in Pania in the name of "security of national sovereignty".
We're not gonna get back to what's been said.
Among the Papuas, Panama is known as "a troubled, forgotten place".
Poverty feeds on the unhappiness of poverty.
Enarotal has only a small amount of fun to sell, and it's too expensive for the locals,
as well as bread.
The people themselves are intoxicating themselves: mainly sweets and a bit of fruit and leaves.
It is the work of women, and one person can be responsible for four or five battle fields.
That's part of the crop, and it's all over the market.
Ten sweets only cost 10,000 rubles (75 cents).
As time differences between locals and others have increased, and the number of others has increased since the opening of new routes to Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to local better-trained and more responsible migrants.
Only a few bean industry have sufficient skills and skills to run their own business in a real way.
"You young people don't want to stay in the country because there's no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Panai Council.
The extremism of Paphu will be left nowhere in the world.
In addition, the restrictions on modern information are still tight.
Earlier this year, public journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papuaa, even if they had been granted a single licence. The official reason for this was the inability to cooperate with the public authorities.
According to Human Rights Watch, U.S. Deputy Director, Phelim Kinen, Yokowi has not held any election rights; he has not increased the doubt and has not contributed to the renewal of the information.
"From Indonesia's restless eastern provinces to the Papua and to the West Papua, the new suppliers have the following: no entry into the picture and no entry to the blacklist", Kine stated in her opinion.
The lack of freedom of action means that the Indonesian Government is under pressure only by its neighbours in Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the United States — called on the United Nations Council to investigate the "numbering and widespread violations" of Papua, including the Panai shooting.
These countries have, in the first place, also supported the migration of Papua to Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, informant of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, disputed attacks and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so the cover-up of evidence would be an issue".
They want foreign governments to get involved.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands, led by Ambassador Kees Van Bar, visited Jayapuru on 4.5th April, locals broke the silence and expressed their desire for truth, reports the anonymous source of the visit.
In Indonesia there are presidential elections 2019, but the Papians tell us that we are no longer likely to vote for Jokowi.
"If that means good, but there are people around who have been involved in the Panai shooting," says the Council of Governors Gobai.
He wants to know the situation of the people of Asia: they live under the control of a greedy and unpredictable army in need and poverty, in fact, without health care services and methods of education.
According to Gobai, the Panics, like the rest of the Pagans, are holding the votes they have made for Jokow, which must be paid back.
"they don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the intimidation and intimidation, the victims of the Panai shooting incident once again demonstrated resistance in a symbolic way: they buried one of the victims in the opposite country of the station and the military office.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they will not be held responsible for their own problems.
"My family member was killed," says Yacobus in his head.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora says about the withdrawal of Robert Henius' re-evaluation: "Even his own fans don't want to see it."
Robert Helenius and Derek Chisoran, a large number of boxers, were meant to be in Hartwall on 27 May.
However, this took place for commercial reasons.
Chisora has a fresh IFL TV interview because of the re-floating of the re-floating to the top of Helen.
Being in Finland was a flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to fly tickets there.
It was my Finnish opponent.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora's bored.
Helenius and Chisora first met in the full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Helenius won the game on a controversial score.
In May, Nisse Sauerland, its promoter, told Ila-Sanom that the match had been launched.
There's nothing more about the weather than hearing about it.
The return will no longer upset Chisora.
In any case, after Chisora's illness, the situation would have probably had to be cancelled.
Thursday, three days before the middle of the day, I realized I was in pain.
The solid was about to explode.
The hospital said I had to be cut, Chisora says.
The British state is currently in 45 % condition at present.
He is not all that interested in re-integration with Heius; he is aiming at Dillian Whyte.
Chisora supported Whettle's loss in December by a string of votes.
The second one came to power in the Lord of the Torch Cloud.
The flames took over the world's highest residential building in Dubai in the near future. Hundreds of inhabitants were sent to the West from a 70-foot tall building.
This was already the second fire in a two-year building whose name happens to be a Torch, owl.
There was no idea of the fire immediately after the event. The reason for the fire was not known.
"We were in bed and woke up to the voice of an alarm and people's screams.
One of our doors down from the 50th floor, which took ten minutes, was told Reuters by a resident named George.
According to the rescue officers, fire extinguished at 4 p.m. for a while, and they'll be waiting for the building to be refurbished.
The government has announced that it will provide accommodation for those who have left their homes.
The event can re-create the environment of high-level buildings in different parts of the world.
The Governing Board of the Torch building carried out a study in 2015 following a fire in which it was found that the most damage was caused by the cover-up and insulation of the ceilings.
In the United Kingdom, the police believe that the London Grenfell Tower’s insulation and curtaining equipment could contribute to the rapid progress of the flames in the fire, where 80 people died in June.
The park in Joensuu was replaced during moutam night.
In Joensuu parking lot, Mopo was stolen from Tuesday at 21 a.m. and Wednesday at 5 a.m.

In the United States of America, more than 20% of the residents of the country of origin bring in items that are blocked by the machine, reveals the survey.
A survey of air passengers reveals that more than 20% of the refugees in the United States had taken a lot of objects knowingly or unawarely through the US Transport Safety Agency (TSA) access points. At least six of the refugees had knives or other valuable objects that they didn't know were open.
Less than one percent reported that they had only learned immediately that they had carried weapons, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
More than a thousand passengers were asked, and it was implemented by the Tratos Jet Charters chartering company, which also reveals that young passengers are more likely to challenge the rules.
Of TSA’s conscious families, 19.7% were representatives of the Y-generation and less than 15% belonged to the X-generation.
The most common thing was to take it.
In addition, 2.2% of men and 3.7% of men reported that they had taken dangerous substances for information.
Families from all over the United States participated in the survey. The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally taken the smuggling goods past security and how many had done so consciously.
It is no doubt that the most busy people are also most likely to be able to transport smuggled goods by secure means — knowingly or unconsciously.
As the company that made it clear, TSA's instructions are very complex and confusing.
Passengers often do not know what they can take and how much they need.
It's no surprise, then, that most of the TSA's trunks are solid.
There was also the feeling that books should not be exported to the site for some time.
The liquids can be transported to the country but not to the sea.
Mr Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States of America's Environment Agency, decided to delay the decisions taken during Obama's period in some ways.
On the day after 15 States had challenged the right of the President of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, the United States of America, withdrawn its previous decision to delay the implementation of decisions taken during the Obama regime to prevent fraud.
According to Pruitt, the change shows that the agency he led takes better account of the environmental policy objectives of the Lands.
Mr. Pitt did not mention in a word the action against which his decision had been taken before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The Member States should start to meet the level of the ground level for 2015 as from 1.10.
Pruitt announced in June that he would move forward the implementation of the decisions by one year so that he would have more time for the Agency to look into the plan, because the Agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt was the Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma State before President Donald Trump appointed him as President of the EPA. Pruitt is known as the opponent of stricter environmental rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the execution of decisions against the industrial industries in the manufacturing and fossil fuel industries.
The sudden change in the mood on Wednesday is the last setback for Prüutt's plan to ease the provisions.
A federal petition was issued last month in Washington by a decision that the Director of the EPA exceeded his mandate in trying to stop the implementation of the Obama government decision on oil and gas companies.
In its opinion on Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his full translation of the provisions on the ground only strengthens EPA cooperation with the States States in a complex process aimed at achieving new requirements as scheduled.
'In the past, Epa often failed to comply with the deadlines and then that the working groups and others would change the right to make the timetables,' said Mr Pruitt.
"We do not believe in regulation through this process and we do not believe in deadlines seriously.
We are also very serious about the regulation on our activities and the mandates we have given us."
However, in the opinion of the EPA, Pruitt may still use "the power to adopt decisions and other acts" to ensure that the provisions "are justified and protected by the information available".
In the United Kingdom, the Republics are in the process of bringing about a wider change in the regulations of the world.
The aim of the bill adopted last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
It has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
In this context, the EPA has been called upon to bring together state-owned organisations in the New York State Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman said that he was trying to press on.
"The change in the EPA's mentality as a result of our actions is a great deal for those 6,7 million New Yorkers and over 11 million Americans who are exposed to direct influences in their communities", Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia were involved in the action.
The top of the ground is formed when emissions from vehicles, power plants, oil refineries and chemicals in the atmosphere are exposed to sunlight in the atmosphere, for example.
This mist can cause serious difficulties for vulnerable groups. It is also part of the premature life each year.
Public health promoters and environmentalists were pleased with the surprising change of direction by Prüitt.
"It is worrying how much pressure was required to ensure that the fellow in our breathing was sound," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We still have to fight the Trump regime, for its ideological objective is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups of people who have their own interests."
Automobile manufacturer's coming from a street gardener - "events in Ferrari's style"
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to hold on to its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it will be in Ferrari's mind, as CEO Sergio Marchionne said about the plans for the event on Wednesday.
The new details of the strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian supercar manufacturer will present its new five-year plan, the Automation News news.
All cases of East Savo ashtrays of the same type are of the same type.
Rantasalmi is the same virus as the previous cases of East Savo, reported in THL.
The health and well-being virology laboratory has ensured, on Thursday, that the fifth outbreak of EAST Savo is the same as that of previous infections.
THL has confirmed that on 28 July the presence of an ashtray infection on the beach is the same as in the previous cases of Eastern Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections found in Eastern Savo relate to the first ash found in the region in June.
The news is good, because it means that we have not come up with any other types of ashtray virus.
However, it is possible that after the 5th disease there may still be new infections in the mid-term, and the epidemic is not over, as Mr. Mirkaleena Erkkilä, who is responsible for basic health diseases in Soster, says.
No new findings in or evidence of the presence of ashtrays have been identified since the fifth case of confirmation.
However, it is still important that everyone takes care of the updating of their own vaccine protection, Erkkilä.
On the subject: In Pirkanmaa, three new mumps were confirmed - "An additional inspection or epidemic is highly unlikely".
Completing to make a valid race.
The cooking of the spot is not even considered legal.
On the basis of the basis that the process produces, along with alcohol, methanol, which is dangerous.
Making a race at home is legal next year, but the legalisation of the spotless soup is not yet foreseen.
The scream is prepared by the way, just again by distillation.
Against the background of the regulation of distillation, there are grounds for the process to produce, along with the alcohol, methanol which is dangerous.
Ismo Tuominen, Minister of Social Affairs and Health, commented on this point.
When the Ministry was preparing for the reform of the alcohol law, the precise distillation was not considered legal.
The matter was not brought to the same table either.
There was no debate on the release of distillation, says Mr Outut Mäkelä (Kok.)
He is in the negotiating group of the parliaments of the United States, who supported the rule of law on alcohol.
In the future, the second point of distillation at home is not even possible on the basis of the application.
The retail production will be maintained in the form of an authorisation.
Importing tells us that home-making of alcoholic beverages becomes a second rule: you can prepare the alcohol by going home.
This means that now, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally scream.
The government has tried to simplify regulations.
The new law removes the requirements for flavourings and flavourings and allows for the production of the kiln, Mäkelä refines.
The production must continue to take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings and flavourings produced in connection with their use are clearly present in the drink.
Under the law, drinks can be prepared as much as they want, and self-employed alcohol can be given as a gift.
To sell it is still not allowed to do so.
Doing a race is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuominen believes.
The major change occurred in 2004 when passenger imports from the Union and other EU countries changed.
75% of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now under review by the Ministry of Justice.
The alcohol law comes to the Parliament as soon as it comes to dawn.
The plenary session is 5.9.
The law will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It is as if Parliament had already taken a stand, Mäkelä is happy.

Founded telephone conversations mean that Trump was forced by Trump to build a border wall.
The telephone conversations between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked to the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation held on 27.1.2017, Mr Trump urged the President of the Republic of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop speaking to the public about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
"You can't say that to the press," Trump said.
Trump launched his presiding campaign by promising to build a wall to the south of the United States at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also opened a littering about Trump's first talk to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull. During the interview, a intense exchange of views took place.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement whereby the United States would take refugees in Australia is "stupid", "stupid" and "stupid". According to Trump, Obama's period of negotiated agreement would make me look like a "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the housing of refugees in the United States.
He ended the debate by saying to Turnbull that "this was the most uncomfortable thing all day".
Moon's eavesdropping: The occults re-enacted the right of racist lynchion in the pursuit of the right of race.
The Ford Mercury brand car passes a crowd of people in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, and continues its journey towards the small bridge of Moore's Ford.
There are four black passengers and one driver in the car, four men armed on the way before the car hits the bridge.
One of the leaders, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, takes a deep breath of his cigar and carries through a fireglass.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-o-o-man's snooping.
"Get out of the car!"
The lips break the silence when a young black man pulls out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this major event is only a redeployment, which was presented on 22.7.
But the shocks are real when you put the hanging on Roger's neck.
Since 2005, the human rights organisations have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to reinvigorate the events of the next year. At that time, Ku Klux Klan lynked two diabolical couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that everything has not been arrested in these days – even though murderers live on us and many must know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will help with the reboot arrangements.
"It's a waste of history, but above all, it's a burden that weighs on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil rights activist and a former Georgian representative.
It is an alarming call, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that injustice has never been organised.
"We want the guilty to be right. We want the cases to be completed, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all, we want justice", Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and make peace until we have the right."
The M.E. is covering the body of the victim who died in the victim's victim's death on 27 April 1996.
According to the FBI's news of the NBC, more than 50 people from Monroe and the rest of the county were suspected of lynching.
No one's ever been accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been in the past few decades, it is reported that the motives for lynching have been known all along: politics and sex.
In the first time in the presidential elections, the black people in the Georgian state voted for the first time. The Supreme Court gave its decision in April, and the elections were held in the summer.
According to the FBI, there was a time in which a black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed the white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that obviously concerned Malcom's wife, Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there was a rumor in town that Hester had an affair with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expecting a child.
According to U.S.A., the powerful landowner, Loy Harrison, was told on 25th of April 2019 that the 600th bail against which he was released was released.
On the way home, the company of Malcomin and Dorothy were their cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before the bridge of Moore's Ford.
"It has become apparent that Harrison ordered and committed murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the world and local authorities, and the authorities were involved in the murders and lost evidence and did not reveal the identity of the Bible."
Mr. Brooks says the matter more at the heart of the matter.
"It was a vote," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to be informed that it would happen to them if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been conducting the re-entry of Georgia for a decade.
The presentation is extremely realistic and perceptive, a description of the sudden racism that many believe has already disappeared from today's United States of America.
It's almost even easier not to see what Greenen thinks it's all about.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we've met our own dark side," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you can't hear me or you don't want to hear what I've had to see."
This year's activities took place in June. On the first day, some 30 actors – a dozen of the blacks and two of the whites – met about Greene's routine summary.
Wade Marbaugh works as Green's assistant director.
He has been re-launching the local President of Ku Klux Klan for many years, but the role is always equally smooth and hostile.
"It's gonna be dirty because I'm not myself," Marbaug says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of the history is also discussed so that it does not ever again."
On the other side of the room, the graduates are Darrius Greshaw and Nick Rascona, i.e. Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
The debate was held at a scene where Maljek was yelling and giggling Hester, and he's upset that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy.
"Don't you hear me? I said leave my country, n--u!"
This is Rachel, or Hester.
Let's go.
And then all (at least all black actors) will be laughtered.
Greene's name is tougher than it is.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's in trouble.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" Go.
"No," Greene says.
"I just don't think the good guys would use the word n--u at that time."
"Yes," another half-skin actor confirms.
"It's slang. You need to use a longer version."
The subject is insensitive, but the power of the spirit is powerful.
Every effort will be made, and not just because they want to honor the memory of those who have been killed.
Okay, here we go.
Now, the words of the man do what he says.
No one does.
The redeployment will end quickly and violently.
Shit, shots... and silence.
A black funeral erupting in a hole next to the bodies and singing Billie's Strange Fruit.
His voice is resting in every other word.
A few ten metres away, five-six viewers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
In general, half of them are black and half-white.
There is a couple who are present in Ithaca, New York, but most of them are present.
They have visited Brooks at the invitation of the victim's graves in the pressurised humidity of Georgia.
Murders have become true from the story. The atmosphere at the scene is heavy.
After the presentation, Greene calls on the bodies of the force to search for the bodies.
The children are pouting to look at the ghost and motionless bodies and whispering to the Bible.
"They're not really dead," the boy's kind of like himself.
A few minutes later, Greene will be playing.
Actors who were looking for loops took off their caps and wiped out their tears.
Bradsaak hugs Marbaugh, the local director of Ku Klux Klan, who is the director of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona will catch two actors and then rest in tears after the runaway.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
"We know you're not him.
"You did a good thing."
Later, the audience and the actors will meet for a single dinner.
The new couple who have arrived from the basement are having a lively discussion with the gay couple they have just met about the proposal.
Denise Duplinski is trying to find words when he describes the knowledge that exists.
"It is hard to listen to horrible words and look at the terrible things that people are doing and people are doing who look like you – precisely because they look like you," he says.
"My presentation made it clear that the limps are still going on," added. "That's just what they're called. "
On the other side of the room, Brooks remembers the development of civil rights for those sitting at the same table.
He says he's already started next year's development.
"Re-deployment is a powerful experience because it describes the horrors that we have experienced, but it is also a educational experience," Brooks says.
"The message is that this can happen again if we do not take note of it.
Those who do not know their history are understanding it again."
Stocking of growth in trades fluctuated by: Remove this "total amount"
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of the flower pot already in trade before weighing?
Take off a large part of the hat. How much do you care?
The answer is strong: for one it is a proof of the total loss of food; for another it does not want to pay for the parts of the vegetables that do not work and which, however, go to the garbage house.
The goods will be identified in trade.
Welcome to the section of the K-City market in the Ruhooholahti, Sweden, you can find cardboard boxes because many rip off the leaves of the flowercave, for example.
From the box, leaves are sold to the market for bio-waste.
According to the word of the word of the economy, a nuisance on a vegetable plant is admiring traders.
How much money does it save to remove extra parts of vegetables before weighing?
How is it really a major means of non-compliance?
We women test how the price changes when you take or take leaves from pineapple, latva artichokes, sweeteners, broccoli, and cockroach.
Cauliflower: €2.10 came at 1.80 when all the leaves were removed.
Ananas: €2.8 a sum of an entire Ananas price dropped to €1.95 when it turned away.
Latva artichoke: 2,6 EUR price became 2,40 when the short position was cut off.
Herbs: Two sweets a total of 75 cents.
Half the price of stocks became 60 cents.
Borrowing: A medium-sized balconies totalling EUR 1 and without a total of 80 cents.
Result: If leaves and positions go off, save at least a few dozen cents at the best for one vegetable.
As a percentage, the price of vegetables is up to 20 per cent.
The total cost of these purchases would therefore have been EUR 1,22.
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - Brass Star in the fifth year contract with PSG for the fifth year.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the P.G.C. of the CSA, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a price of EUR 222 million to the FC Barcelona on the same day.
The maximum amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the government history.
The last record was at the United States, which last summer was EUR 105 from the former Mr Pogba.
In fact, the move was rejected earlier on Thursday, when it destroyed Neymar's first payment.
According to the League rules, the buying-out price cannot be paid directly to the seller, but the player himself must buy out his contract, which is done by means of a cash machine.
In practice, P.P.G. has paid the sum to Neymar and this guy, who delivered the cash through the back.
Neym's belief is that Neym's arrival will be in Paris on a Friday.
He will possibly be discussing a new opening to the public at the P.P.G. opening against Aminens last night.
Uefa studies the details of the Uefa.
In addition, in the course of the disclosure of its information on the payment of the European Union to Uefa, the Union shall inform the European Union of any disciplinary action it may have taken in the event.
Among other things, the President of the League, Javier Tebas, has suspected the use of PSG for breaking money in Uefa's economic fair game rules.
Uefa can punish the following, which in the next three years exceeds 30 million euros.
According to Uefa, the transfer of Neymari does not frustrate its own house.
Neymari PSG will be affected by the company for many years, but the effect cannot be assessed on a pre-condition basis.
PG may, for example, be able to use a number of players with a limited amount of information on Uefasta, for example.
PSG is owned by Qatar Public Works Investment.
The chairman will be a former professional worker, Mr Nasser al-Khehaifi.

Austin, 21, got a hell of a lot more burning from the lightning attack - the flash was stored in the airport's security cam.
Austin Dunn was working on a regular job at the Lounas-Floria branch with a couple of co-workers when suddenly the rain from the sky hit the lightning machine.
The force threw the machine into the land of Dunn, near the wing of the plane.
Dunn was in a hurry to go to the hospital.
He had second degree burns in his body.
My father came to me and said that the brother had been hit and he's gone.
I was just asking if she was alive, and Austin's sister, Audomn, says.
Austin spent two weeks in the hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and hemorrhage.
Experience was difficult for the whole family.
There's no way to wait.
It's tragic for everyone, Atomn tells us.
According to a messenger, the lightning risk warning system was in motion and the transport itself decides whether to do so.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and resuscitates business by cutting dividends.
The British company Pearson announced once again that he would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut dividends by 72 percent when starting a new restructuring programme in response to the pressures of his business.
According to CEO John Fallon, employment cuts will be made mainly at the end of 2018 and early 2019, which already reduced 4,000 jobs in the context of the first restructuring.
Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of his third saving programme, which was designed to revive the business that is causing rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to grant a share of Penguin Random House's sales to Bertelsmann again. He was aware that he had a similar view of the current year, net sales during the first half of the year and amounted to GBP 2,05 billion.
a hit-and-run in Kabul: NATO Party was killed in an accident.
The suicide bomber struck a military bombardment in Kabul, Afghanistan's capital city. According to the authorities, he was killed in the attack by the Nazi Republic and injured by the police.
According to NATO's opinion, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
According to unconfirmed local data, there were also three people killed in the attack in the Qarabagh region of Kabul.
The explosion is the latest violent attack in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed in an explosion in the Moscow in the Awake!
On Monday, two people were killed by a death bomber in the Arab Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol between the NATO and the Afghan Army "with a man on a self-made explosive device" was attacked.
The report stated that everyone who had been injured was stable and treated at the US military hospital at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the strength of the attack and the presence of the ISIS terrorist organization in Qarabagh are important to NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 people were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20% were killed in the capital.
At the end of the summer, the car bomb killed at least 30 people in a shooting in Kabul in an area where most of the Shiiamals live.
The Taliban declared that he was behind the attack.
On the first day of May, in the middle of Kabul, more than 150 people were in the middle of a bombing attack, which was the most devastating munitions of the country after the US leaders were hit by the power of the United States in 2008.
The violence underlines the unstable situation in Afghanistan, as President Donald Trump wonders if the United States will send more troops to help the local community and the police.
According to the writers, recent attacks in Kabul have also undermined people's confidence in the public, their own policy and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
EPA asks for its decision to postpone the implementation of the legislative provisions.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suspended the decision to delay the execution of decisions taken during the Obama regime, in order to prevent the use of force majeure, on the day that the 15 States had brought an action before the Office.
According to the Authority, the decision is a demonstration of its commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the requests of the state," said Scott Pruitt in the opinion of the Agency.
Pruitt announced in June that the Agency's intention to postpone the implementation of the definitions for one year in October 2018 is to measure the level of smoke in certain parts of the country in order to reduce pollution in accordance with the stricter air quality criteria.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged 15 of them mainly the United States of America, including the District of Columbia, which said that it was illegal to postpone the execution.
The Government of President Donald Trump has sought to mitigate the environmental rules of Barack Obama, which are part of a broader programme of economic growth.
The most recent measures have been opposed by democrats and environmentalists, who are concerned about the effects of increased effects on the environment.
According to the EPA website, breathing of the ozone-filled air “is able to reduce the activity of the lungs and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the father's leading character had also sent to Sydney the building blocks of the bomb.
Suspects that the bomb was supposed to be taken to the gun on 15 July, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police will not tell us more why the attempt has been interrupted.
It was the practice of existing suspects to build a non-toxic gas-distinguishing device and to take the device to its accuracy in public places, for example, in a public device.
Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan of the Republic of Australia says that the theory was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
On the basis of suspected misbehaviours, four men were killed in police raids last night.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also under way.
Neste Managing Director: Renewable fuels went well.
The oil refiner Neste made before the tax fell, but found the predictions in the second quarter.
According to CEO Matti Lievose, the company made a good impression on oil products, the sales volume of the products turned to the record level and the development of operating profit for the Marketing & Markets segment was in the right direction.
Last year's comparable operating profit was improved by the tax relief of the United States Blenders Tax Credit.
According to Lieves, the operating profit of the manufactured products remained at a good level at this time, even if the tax relief ended, on the basis of higher sales and more favourable markets.
Our implementation will go well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects and we will continue to focus on the global investment that we have already announced in 2017, as Lievonen stated.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko will discuss a possible review at their first meeting.
Vasy Lomatchenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a crossroads at the same time as the most interesting boxing match for the near future of a series of less than 66,7 kg, met the next Thursday at the same time.
The men were in their own rooms in ESPN sports in Los Angeles until WBC's unbeatable open series master Mikey Garvia walked along the way to welcome Lomashenko, WBO's superior master of the crowd.
On Saturday, Garcia won the last four-weight world world's Adria Broner by consensus, and since then Garcia and Lomachenko have been the top five of the top weight-weight boxers on the comparative list.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "What's up, man?
Tomorrow!"
Lomachenko defends his titles against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN channel from anywhere last year.
When the two posed for the photographers, Lomatchenko's manager, Egis Klimas, pointed out that each other's match would be "good for the whole relationship".
"I am an ex-fiancé", Garia reminded me.
"I moved the series higher [63.5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I am of a small size for 63.5 kg.
I want to go back to the Wednesdays.
He's got to get up to the cleanup sequence [1,2 kg], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Their wish will be fulfilled."
Lomašenko agreed with him.
"The boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if there should be a payline. It is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko to debut in the first series later this year and take the next summer against Garcia (37-0, 30 beats). Garcia would also be interested in winning the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell.
"It may be possible to be on the payline because the fans have argued for it," Garcia said, and later announced that she would be ready to take the channel that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
The rest of us don't have as much attention as we do.
For me, as soon as we reach an agreement ...
Garcia said that she felt like Lomachenko was a "unbelievable fighter" and that maybe we're going to go see yesterday's match.
Lomachenko interrupted Garcia's uniform and said that this three-weight master from Riverside felt "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knockout".
Garcia said that she focused on showing the first force and then boxing.
The men said that they felt that the fight between them was to become more and more effective.
"This is the game we're going to have.
No other thing attracts as much attention and interest as it does.
I'm definitely involved in this case," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said that he was waiting to be able to fight the best. "What's the legend?
It's gonna be a great fight."
Average wage of EUR 5 300, education and training, what happens - the situation of an investment firm has been "global and free".
The quality of investment advice has been much discussed lately.
Last time I heard the news, Ritva, 68, was told by the banker's investment advisor who was talking about a whole bunch of investment products for sale.
Investment advice and joint sales rules for investment firms and collective investment products will be tightened at the beginning of next year.
The specifications are based on the new Financial Market Directive, which will apply from the beginning of next year.
At present, the assessment of the skills of investment firms and sellers is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no qualifications in the law.
Financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in the public service perform their own APV1 or APV2 degree.
The financial sector has contracted the organisation of a degree to an APV Investments Association (APV) company, which operates in the field of employment, both in the field of financial supervision (Fiva), universities and industry.
The degrees are of a total of 12,15 credits, and their exams are made up of the Aalto EE, which is the University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management monitoring services.
On the website, it is said that, in general, both exams are "excessively comprehensive".
Qualifications include 10-15 books, as well as numerous other guides and works.
The CEO of APVs, Markku Savikko, tells us that the review rate of the tests is roughly 70 per cent.
Most of the staff of the largest banks have completed either an APV1 or an APV2 rating, since it is mandatory for companies to carry out these tasks in accordance with their own rules.
Then there are smaller transactions, regardless of the names of the staff affected by the completion of the degrees, Savikko says.
According to this, other transactions are "others".
According to the Savrik, APV1 qualification has been completed since 2000 by between 13,000 and 14,000 people and by approximately 3 000 people who are recommended by the most demanding investment firms.
Traders consider the completion of the qualification to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have much more stringent knowledge requirements.
Savik says that the Financial Recommendation requires the performance of APV qualifications, as that is when investment-related expertise is ensured.
According to the statistics, financial and investment advisors make on average thousands of euros per month, including commissions, nature benefits and income.
The average working time of the monthly wage is approximately EUR 5 300.
Working hours earn more than EUR 5 900 in the next six months and more than EUR 4 500 in the last six months.
The highest-income public averages about €8 100 per person per year.
The highest number of men making up the house is over 9 000 euros a month or more, one-tenth of the women making up the house is over 6 400 euros or more.
Investment services law investment advice can only be granted by a licensed company.
□ the Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Member States.
According to Fiva, one of the cases in which the investment firm’s professional skills and qualifications were not sufficient to perform the advisory work were the subject of an inspection.
As a matter of fact, it is possible to work as a tool for improving the quality of the products, even if skills and qualifications are at a low level.
Basically, in this regard, the facts have been wild and free.
Several other sectors have much more stringent knowledge requirements, Savikko č.
According to the fine, until the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new Financial Markets Directive (MiFID II).
This requires each company to be responsible for ensuring that staff providing public services are sufficiently qualified.
Financial control, in turn, may be empowered to determine what needs to be learned.
Fiva’s market surveillance officer, Marko Hovi, says that one of the clear changes to the current situation is to adapt the knowledge and experience requirements of investment advisors and investment products vendors.
According to the Court, the new requirements apply to both the private sector staff and the related agent who sell products on behalf of one company.
According to the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be authorised to determine knowledge and experience.
Of course, what they are exactly will be decided during the coming autumn.
In the future, the company will also have to take care of the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and continuing training.
All of this has to be documented, and the company has an obligation to prove that this has also been done.
The Court states that, in reality, the company must, for example, identify the staff's duties on an equivalent basis.
This is certainly going to be different levels depending on whether it is an investment firm or the sale of products.
According to the Court, it is also a request to work with a more experienced person for a fixed period of time, if knowledge or life is not at an adequate level.
So if the company hires a new job, which is not fully defined by the criteria, then the company must work with the person who meets the criteria.
According to the Court, changes will lead to tightening and concreteisation of the rules.
The investment product sales legislation will be strengthened at the beginning of 2018.

The aircraft's flight route was located in the United States at Flightradar 24 service.
An operation took place on Thursday on 7 August Dreamliner, where Boeing test machine for Rolls Royce engines was run on a long run from the Boeing machine.
The machine that left Seattle flew 18 hours and 1 minute a distance of 15 700 kilometres, which is longer than any permanent commercial route available in the world.
All the way in and out of the United States of America, they stayed within the limits of the United States.
It flew through the 17th in total.
Imatra's incubated beach swimming schools do not need rain or sunshine - Iines Kaikän polski was forced to swim with the help of the village.
No Kaikänen is not at a good pace, Taina is in the middle of Italy.
Imatra beach swimming schools are playing in Litte and Lempka for this and next week.
Sometimes it rains and then it bakes again, that young swimmers are not either, compliments Taina Itkonen, the manager of the swimming schools.
In bathing schools this week, a total of 13 children will be surveyed next week, next week.
The next week's childhood was affected by the fact that school and school are starting to take place, assessing Itkonen.
Imatra beach swimming school is organised in collaboration with the Sports Association project and the city of Imatra.
On Thursday at the Lithuanian beach, there was a comfortable atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young swimming schools were training to stay up with swimming trails, one at a time.
The water also enjoyed smaller things.
No matter what, 5th thought about going deeper into the water first.
I think I'm going to go to the beach, but I think I'm going to go to the beach.
All right, let's go.
Eiikkin told me that he had been swimming a lot this summer.
Soap swimming is good.
Like everyone else, Pili Huhtanen, 5.
You too will be pleased with what has been achieved today, bathing praise.
Jami Kallio, four others wanted to go back to the water war.
Ilona Vilberg, who followed her daughter Anna Vilberg, 6, from the beach, considers the beach swimming school to be a good start for swimming learning.
They're what's going on, let everyone go.
I mean, I had to keep up.
Swim-schoolers freezed to the yard.
The cops had enough to do with the bomb on the side of the road.
One million, three, and Anna Vilberg spread the explosives to the pier, soaring and frying the day.
In fact, the training has already been continued, but there is no need for the dock to be on board.
A guy who doesn't have a summer to talk to.
In the unknown, there's an unknown Polish toilet trainer, "Here's some sort of connected story".
It's different than that.
A couple of months ago, the Blue Product that manufactures cleaning products launched the product series Unknown Military.
So, the counters and the laundry and the "Wc brush with the edge brush".
In this context, the unknown catholic refers to the first-night film and film marketing.
Still, there is something special about it, and the products have been smiled at in common media: Where do you come from?
I'll go see what's going on and see what's going on here.
What does Aino Mättä say?
We're partners.
We are in favour of this film, as are many others.
We wanted to support domestic production and cult film," Mättä says.
According to the standard of products, special distribution comes for shops, and the film thus gets visibility.
It's kind of funny when you think that the products and the related stories have something in common?
So here's the combination of the fact that we are Finnish operators and these are Finnish products, says Mättä.
He is in favour of the basic Finnish values that those who have seen the old Unknown are in favour of.
Cleaning up is not a stranger to the army culture, I don't know.
Other partners in the unknown film - such as Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, there have been imports of Hartwall vichy, which can be found in Rokka, Hietane and Koskela.
The unidentified information is already available in English as a copyist Kalle Kinnunen.
Coffee and watches are already available.
I wonder if there's still time for the first time, and we're still on the table.
The unknown partners have not yet been exposed to war products, for example, by Valio, the processor, Neste and the German retailer Lidl, Kinunen.
A new publication of the Swedish asylum application age test was published.
The results of the tests carried out under the new evaluation method indicate that more than 80% of the tests were determined to be over 18 years of age. Not all do not consider tests to be reliable.
The Swedish Legal Service started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to assess the age of an asylum seeker. A new test was carried out after the Swedish Immigration Service was judged to have failed in determining the actual life of the applicants who claimed to be underage.
The Agency has so far done 6 880 tests and has now been informed by the Agency of the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between the middle of March and the end of July 2017.
80 % of the test population, i.e. 2002 asylum seekers, were determined to be over 18 years of age.
432 cases concluded that the asylum seeker was "usually under 18 years of age".
The tests were carried out only in cases where there was no doubt about the applicant's known value.
Mr Györgyson's Legal Service tells us that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly uniform. There are no big differences in the statistics for the last months," he told The Local magazine.
While most applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, it does not necessarily mean that some people would have lied to their lives.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 588 test and announced that in 442 cases there were "references that the investigation is 18 years old or older".
When Svenska Dagblad looked at the same results, it became apparent that, in 243 cases, the applicant had openly reported that he was going to be 18 years old this year.
In the evaluation process of the sensible age used in the tests, there are images of wisdom toothy and magnetic images of the knee joints. The  homes and radiologists analyze the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is Claude Marcus, the endographer of the Caroline Institute, whose work is to assess human maturity. The evaluation can be used to determine whether a person’s puberty is normal earlier or later.
“I had reason to think about it, and I think the method is not the right one.
The definition of biologic age in this case is very uncertain.
If we are not sure how to determine the course, we should not pretend to be able to do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, the Office of Justice, Goransson, defended the accuracy of the tests: "Of course, it can be assumed that the risk for an adult is small.
is the highest point in which the test is to be carried out in the next 18 years, with a risk of about 10%."
Ione crashed 30 places in Scotland.
Five more than a result on the second round was spent by Mikko Ilosen 30 in a print box down to the curfew of the European tour in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Tuesday for 11th but found at the end of the round a split for 41th.
In this event, three bugs were followed by one double-bogi.
Others had a hard time, too.
Ian Poulter, a foreigner, came back to share the lead position on less than a few rounds, even though he told me that there was work to be done on the umbrella's lengths.
Keli was raw, but I was with her, and then I had a good day, Poulter.
He shares the lead with his countryman Callum Shikwin and his Australian Andrew Dodt.
The Governor of West Virginia shall exchange parties.
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced his party at the Trump campaign on Thursday night.
"The Democrats are just trying to stop me," Justice said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and thorough reflections... let me tell you to the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as governor of the Party."
The night was loudly popular.
"Tomorrow as a member of a registered Republican Party," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say to you that it is time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign.
Trump won at 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support Hillary Clinton, a democratic candidate.
Justice was elected governor in 2016 according to Forbes, he is the only major in the state.
He owns a mining company and owns coal mines in the United States of America.
The value of his assets is about 1.09.
The Committee of the Republics (RNC) will issue an opinion on Thursday evening that "The turnover of Governor Justice is once again another attack on the Party of the United States, which will create obstacles than the US."
"The Democrats have only 15 governors and less states than ever before. In this context, Justice's announcement is the latest setback for a party that has no leadership and is not capable of strong, people-to-people speaking," said Ronna McDaniel, the representative of the RTC, in his opinion to CBS.
The blinds caused damage - Thursday comes even every summer in the morning.
In this week's week, more scars are also available in South Finland.
Over the past few years, it has been sore in the middle and north of the country and in the region of South-West Finland.
Between Wednesday and Thursday, several fires occurred during the night.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be the middle of the day.
Those who are superstitious have also come to Finland.
Over the past few years, every one of the countries in the middle and north of the country and in the region of South-West Finland has been exposed to lightning.
On the table, lightning struck the electric power station at the rail station, causing a small fire.
The relief service received a notification of the report about 15 to midnight on Wednesday.
The power station was located in the sauna mode at the end of the row house.
The rescue plant poured out the roof and the wind to find the cinderellas and threw out the fire vibratingly.
A total of eleven dwellings were left without electricity, but no deaths were avoided.
Again, in Loimaa, the lightning lit an external building for pensions in Harju County before midnight.
At the time of arrival of the facility, the building was already at the beginning of the fire, and the civil protection plant cannot but prevent the fire from spreading.
The outer carton of about 50 metres in size burned to the ground.
On the other side of the moon, another lightning strike the home house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and proved to be a glamorous lightning attack.
The Civil Protection Department was on the spot to check the case, but this time the lightning did not give the time for a fire - only a few fuses went off.
In traffic there was a high level of trouble on the railway track between the Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when the lightning switched to the traffic control system.
Information was received on Thursday morning between 9 and 9, after which the lines were replaced by buses and buses.
It was not possible to adjust until just before five afternoons.
Since then, road transport has usually also gone to the top of the rail with a sounding track section.
The blinds have worn out the whole of Finland in a variety of ways.
However, there has been very little confidence in the summer.
This summer's silences are all too bad! Review Weather Science Department's day-to-day weather forecaster Jari Tuovinen.
Wednesday and Thursday’s thunderstorms have been mostly moderate, but thanks to a little lightning flash in the summer, it also seems to me to be a lot of thanks.
This could feel like a really tough mouth, but that's what it's been like this summer," says Tuovinen.
On Wednesday, the soil peaks were 1 700 times, and on Thursday, there has been a potential even for the toughest day of the summer: by about 16 o’clock, there were 1,790 lands on the plain.
If the lightning is still on the other side of the night, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, Tuovinen predicts.
a record deficit of approximately 30,000 pieces in 2015.
By Wednesday, this year’s lightning volume had increased to 18 3 8 p.m.
It is therefore important that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Commission is able to make the most of the resources available to the Member States.
However, the dark one can continue to exist.
According to this, in the atmosphere, Finland will remain on top of Finland during the rest of the week in the atmosphere of smell and moisture, which is a favourable environment for the deaf.
The main focus of the blind is to move from one part of the north to the other, where you can get about 2,000 lightning days both on Saturdays and on Sundays.
There is a single rainfall in the middle of the earth.
According to that type of Importer, there is only a small amount of anger in the mouth.
Coe commends the Russian "open mind" apology for the doping scandal.
The world's sports leader, Mr Coe, praised the open-minded description of his apology for the doping scandal on Thursday. Coe added, however, that there was no time for the Russian to participate.
At the IAAF on Thursday morning at the World Championships, the Russian general sports leader Dmitri Shjuhtin said that the ban on Russia was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "for all the athletes who were taken from in the competitions, gold or silver medals".
Despite his comment, IAAF voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from the general sport competitions in January 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Office WADA's report showed evidence of state-supported doping in Turkey.
"I think his answer today was very direct. It was a very open-minded presentation," the President of the IAAF, Coe, told the journalists.
"Is the Council and the Council pleased that the Community's Public Sport Union has gone through difficult times and is doing everything it can to reorganise its activities."
Coe said that it was also "satisfied" that Russia set out the conditions for the decision of the ban.
"I think it was a very constructive day and progress has been made, but I support the report's recommendation that it is not the right time to put an end to the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We must do everything in our power in the coming months in order to normalise.
The main principle has always been that we want to keep clean athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen main athletes compete with the stand of a neutral athlete in London on the first round of public sports World Championships. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still has many demands before its status can be restored.
"Testing is still insufficient, and the disabled trainers are still working," he told the reporters one day after he was held in London.
The Output Company was disappointed in the weak existence of the Tom of Finland film.
The Tom of Finland film did not say about success as the authors hope, says Yle.
In the meantime, if you say so, I am disappointed, you will recognize the film produced by HI Life at the Annika Sucksdorff Yle interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish film audience might be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film became its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair of 10,000 viewers, which is, by the end of the film, about five million euros, little.
There's no profit coming from this, but it's important now that the investors get theirs back.
If the movie had been better at home, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for a small stream of foreign distribution, says Sucksdorff.

How the economic rules affect the transfer of Neymari to Paris
The provisions restricting the use of European financial means do not prevent Neymari from moving from Spain to Paris Saint-Germain, France Paris, Spain, which is the most expensive bank transfer in the whole of the time.
Its possible consequences for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by a football-regulated UEFA, which can prevent teams from participating in a prestigious Masters League.
UEFA introduced the principle of fair competition in 2011, which states that the PSG must be able to prove that Neymarin has been financed.
A total of €222 million was paid for the closure of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymari's annual salary in the new future will be in tens of millions of dollars.
Neymi's transfer to Belgium involves a number of economic aspects.
PAG does not have trouble paying Neymar's transfer amount and connecting him to its alphabetic order, as it is financed by the QAtar oil-laundered royal race.
They will be able to spend large sums of money on the acquisition of players, but they must be balanced with real sources of income so that the cost of the transaction is not lost.
The rules of fair play were drawn up on the basis of the Public Michel Platin, elected as President of the UEFA in 2007.
As a former judge, Platini felt that the pursuit of a career was a scam and a real problem if the banks or the owners were to withdraw their support.
11 In the year, the focus of fair economic rules shifted from the liabilities of clubs to the follow-up of their losses.
The change meant that, for the first time in Chelsea, the implementation of the version of Roman Abramovich's version in 2003 was seriously hampered. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums of money on player purchases and created a global brand.
The second three-year period of the fair game’s economic rules until 2018, during which time the clubs will be allowed to make up to 30 losses.
Although my board had to leave UEFA's president's duties on a scandalous basis in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Cefer, also wants to spend money on his own.
"The rules of fair play are still in place and we will continue to apply them in the future", in the last session of the UEFA fair game, Mr. Traverso told the Search Press office about fair rules in UEFA.
Although PGs Neymar's out for dinner in exchange, it can record the sum of his new agreement for the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year contract, so the amount of the transfer can be recorded at EUR 44,4 million per year for the following six months.
On the basis of fair economic rules, the first fines were imposed in 2014 on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded City.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the follow-up was also ordered to limit the Masters League to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of 25 players.
UEFA monitors the clubs that might try to enlist its economic rules by increasing its income through partnerships with its owners.
For example, if a US company supports PSG and the value of the aid is considered to be higher than the normal market value, UEFA will not count as a real result of the aid.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support from the Qatari Ministry of Commerce for PSG was over-stated.
It has also become apparent that part of Neymar's earnings in the PSG may be financed by Qatar's 2022 World Exchange Exchange Exchange Commission through the availability of payments.
However, PAG and the Council of Governors have forbidden Neymar to participate in the World Competitions. UEFA would be very easy to disclose such a arrangement.
In view of the previous sanctions imposed by PAG, UEFA will follow companies more closely than usual to circumvent the rules.
The receipts on Thursday reported that UEFA had not consulted P.S.G. on the transfer of Neymar with the PSG.
The sources gave an interview with the General Press News Office on condition that their identity is not revealed, as they do not have the power to discuss PAG status.
According to the latest published estimate, the net sales of PSG in 2015–2016 were 542.4 million and the net sales were more than 10 million.
The current financial statement is not yet published.
PG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of company products and gaming shirts.
It is estimated that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % with the Neymar Agreement.
It was said that the economic rules of fair play were in breach of Neymari’s rules.
"This is a clear case of doping, both in terms of company and in terms of the facts," said Mr. Javier Tebas, President of the League, to the English newspaper AS.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the fact that the State is financing the operation of the Watch Club. Arsenalin owns the American transport company.
"The encounter is the result of a property that has changed the world's operating environment for the last 15 years," said Wengger on Thursday.
"All is always the same when the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with fair play's economic rules. There are so many interests involved in the famous representing the state."
We are in a hurry: Finnish World Sports Coach stuck in Helsinki, Finland.
Mäkelä's coach Suren Ghazarya is stuck in Helsinki, if he should be trained in public sports in the World Championships in London.
Every Mäkelä may have to compete without the advice of his coach.
Tomorrow, the fire will compete in the semi-sparkling process and on the third of Mäkelä’s triple-sharp reduction.
However, the two-way coach, the Medieval Ghazaryan, has not received any English for Britain.
Ghazaryan has been trying to deal with the matter in the British Embassy.
The coach has an invitation from the World Cup organisers in documentation, but it has not been able to obtain any translation either.
I wonder if this is the first of Brexit's symptoms, wouldn't it, Coach Organma Kemppainen said?
He has always dealt with the issues in the past, in fact, but there is something wrong with him right now.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sport Association SUL for years now.
It's not that big of a deal.
Once someone looks at the stadium and looks at the points, Arttu Pajulahti said that his coach would be out of the question.
MM-mati for Finland
The World Sports Championships will start in London this evening and will last a fair week on the end of August.
Public sport, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species that Finnish park athletes are able to take a passion for another day, whether or not they come forward or not.
The success of the park athletes' hearts is measured at the medals.
I'm sure there's more to it.
The beautiful growth stories of young athletes from value competitions to value competitions, in which the acquisition of knowledge matures the performance of the athlete to the extent that the MM medal for adults is genuinely possible, are largely taken into account.
Now, there are no young athletes on the small MM team in Finland, and indeed there are no hookups.
MM-mit to Finland thanks a lot.
The interesting and surprisingness of sport is that miracles can happen.
It pulls the park athletes by the television screen and glues to follow the races, even though London's medals are cut due to the time difference only late in the evening.
From the previous World Cup 2015 for Public Sport, Finland received one bronze medal.
It was brought to you by the fly-thrower Tero Kähmäki.
Even now, the mists are still waiting for something to happen, although the second time he and the others are telling us about the past few days, as well as the remaining of the Longest in last summer's valued competitions.
In any event in these competitions, the Nomämäk will remain in the world as a great Finnish sports hero.
Other Finnish athletes in the society have access to the final race or make a record of themselves is a good performance.
Realism and belief in Finnish public sport for the coming years will be a good success in the international medal hunts this summer as well.
The processing of young talent and supporting its work is more important than maintaining a small population of representative athletes.
Loss won't happen in a moment, but you'll need to sweat up the work of athletes and patience, both from training and from bench athletes.
Finns also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
The London Games will remain in the history of Usai Bolt and Mo Farah, and for example, the fear of war or the despicable blows of the poor.
Enni Rukajärvi is back in Copper's big air, "But, yes, it's hard".
Enni Rukajärvi is located in the second big air race in the United States of America in Colorado.
The 2nd Copper Mountain Night is Rukajärvi's best big air in the world cup.
The little lady won the U.S. Jamie Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 14 points in competition.
The last time he tried to jump on caballeral 1080 was the first time in the race, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and I feel good about this, but I'm really sorry that one jump wasn't right.
From now on, I intend to try again, the base of Rukajärvi.
In the big air of the board, the competitor jumps from the jumper for the purpose of the game.
Viking Line's new high-speed ship went off to Helsinki in Helsinki.
The fleet company Viking's new fast-track FSTR is very late.
The high-speed ship had to leave Helsinki to Tallinn at 6: 00 p.m.
There were a few countries where loading was underway on the ship.
The lady was already there.
At least one and a half hours I've been waiting for you to get into the water.
The car queue is now moving a little, and the Estonian Johannes Rebane, who is waiting to enter the lake in Helsinki, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought that the new ship had gone wrong.
Rebane told me that the shipping company had brought in water bottles waiting for it to enter its cars.
Viking communication manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there's been a problem with fire.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship will be leaving Helsinki in two hours.
Grönlund says that the ship will also be late for a couple of hours after returning to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 2.15 p.m.
A mass transport of 42 m or more will cause traffic on Thursday night.
42 m long special transport moves from Mukoto to Mustola port on Thursday night.
The transport from one to the next should be available by midnight.
traffic is being run in a Notebook, and traffic may be stopped at times.
The route towards Mälk is heading down 13 to the port of Mustola.
The district nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The story is both mastering the 80's and the 90's (so far David Wain and Michael Showalter greeted the brilliant The State series for MTV) and their own time - in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and some other stars moved on to bigger things.
As a product of reason, it is both a good idea and a description of the one-stop-shop we're stuck in during the market time.
In commercial terms, it's already out of date.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not only because of its absurd insanity (in particular, it was mentioned as the secretary of the Swedish can speaking with H. Jon).
The point of the joke is that middle-aged actors act as covetous second-hands close to full-life, stressing it makes it a part of the impossible to reach the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults play adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodys the 90st-century stylkkeroffs, such as the horror movie The Manual that is spinning.
One of the characters is to dig up Apple Powerbook, inline roller skaters and "move the stuff".
Many stories are the same as before.
Hearty Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but is still not over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Some crazy plot is involved in the murder of Ronald Reagan (so-called Michael Showalter) by George H. W. Bush (which is a match for Michael Ian Black).
As in every series, there are side paths.
It's fun to see the ever-old Paul Rudd, who's got a beard up under his lower lip, or Matt Dillan's "soul patch" from the second part of Singles. Rudd's show Andy, the camp's game, is already being an old man.
The moments of frantic insanity may bring this race to a returnive Seven Up! series, until it gets its obvious end: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In that scene, a close friend goes to the first night of the Wet Hot America Summer film.
The Amazon Comrade Detective series once again appeals to another kind of nostalgic: The Americans series, the cold spirit, the Atomic Blonde film, and even the GLOW series's press screenshot, where you will face the West.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made in a Romanian 1980's drama, where a Bulgarian cop fights for truth, atheism and Marksim-lenism.
On top of the main-faced Gregor and idealist Iosefina, we see the Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their lines have been doubled in English by Channing Tatum (the main producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea,
It's all right, it's not.
There are some good visual jokes in the show (police take a while to watch television chess the same way they watch the bike).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahersala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
However, the Conrade Deticive is caught up in the observation of the social adventure of the clumsy – there is a killer hiding behind Reagan's mask.
The six periods are too long, and the number of hours is neither fast nor heavy.
In summary, you might be better at agitprops, perhaps when Poor and Iosef return to the United States Embassy and there are always two fat males in the lobby who are eating burgers.
A message to an imaginary communist public is that the western culture can make it consumer goods and fast food.
The imaginary Romanian creators of the series were not mistaken: as a tool for our own recent history and each and every one of them in our history.
Kouvola Toni Tauru lies anywhere in Macao - facing a former UFC opponent.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight going.
Toni Tauru gets a hard bone against Macao, as the Brazilian Leandro Issa was still in UFC last year.
The Englishman also has a juju-style belt and the city's world championship.
For once, I am against my parent.
It's funny, it's a 32-year-old Tauru story.
Kouvola had to rise to the ring in Indonesia last night.
The fighting was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three fights were made on a short-term basis.
Taru has not yet encountered anything like this.
This was the first time I've ever had a fight.
It gave me a lot of time to get ready and work out.
However, he is pleased that the struggle has been renewed today.
The week of discussion is not much to be prepared for.
No action is taking effect, as it will not be soon.
You can go even worse if you're working too hard now.
In a few previous struggles, there have been opponents who are strong in their ability to stand up.
The situation is different.
Daddy's Kouvolian describes himself as a compatible Brazilian.
He's quite an aggressive fighter.
I'll bet he's gonna come up in one of those hard ones and try to take the mat.
He's won a story about the world championship, so he knows how to run.
The last match of the Koulu did not go as planned.
The Philippinesian Kevin Belingon struck Tau badly in the eye, and the victory remained in the Philippines.
I've never been so well up: he didn't get any hits.
When I went down, he hit me in the eye.
It really messed up for a long time.
New motivation
Once a day, some of the freelancers will come in more widely. Some of them will come in more widely.
For example, the future opponent Issa was waiting for the first time in September.
In turn, last year there were three matches on the road.
We have a second fight ahead of us.
Sometimes it's been a while since we got here.
In recent years, I've been working out and I've been fine all the time.
But all I've been doing is waiting to fight.
When 32-year-olds heard about the coming encounter, he changed the landscape for a while.
In life, I was training, and I got the pleasure back.
We really did good workouts when we had one friend with us.
The training was a great help, for on the other hand, the Kouvolian will have to make a reservation for the struggle.
I've been given the training of opponents of the same size, and I've been able to practice.
Keeping up is a 32-year-old's main tactics.
You have to be smart.
If it comes up, I'm gonna go take a drink myself.
They must not be given for free, as they are the most consumed.
Macao attracts, at least, the Tauru that was in the neighborhood.
I hear it's the Golden Lass.
I assume the front is big and the right air.
Holding the interest rate at 0.25%
The central bank shall report to the ECB that it maintains interest rates in the same way when the economy has been under pressure and inflation reduction has stopped speculation on interest rates.
The Central Bank has asked for a slow economic recovery. The bank has shifted interest rates, as the income of families is becoming more and more under pressure.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank's monetary policy committee decided to hold interest at 0.25% on 6-2, and this month the interest rate was even less in favour because of the fact that the economy has been ineffective.
In the fourth annual report, the average annual growth rate per cent of GDP in 2017 and the forecast for 2018 was 1.6 per cent, and it also warned that the income of households would be increasingly under pressure, while the inflation rate would continue to rise by around three per cent.
However, according to the bank, interest payments are needed in the coming years to deal with the inflation rate raised by Brext.
The members of the Board decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which began to take place a year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Action programme in February 2018, although it is expected that it will now be working through this facility to make a budget of EUR 15 million more than EUR 11 million.
The minutes of the bank's agenda are set out as follows: "According to the Commission's forecast, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years, when the decline in real income for households will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the Commission reiterated that, in order to regulate inflation, the expectations of the market "at least more broadly" need to be addressed by "financial policy tightening up".
The market currently foresees the first promotion in 2018 in the second fourth and second years of 2018 in the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year
However, the bank pointed out that the weightings are "several" and "limits".
In May, the bank expected an increase of 1.9% for the year and a growth of the next year.
It now held its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
The truth of the story and the euro as a result of the news.
The dollar amounts to a total of 0.5% and a total of 1.33 USD. In comparison to the euro, it decreased by 0.4% and was EUR 1.11.
the interest rate is kept unchanged after the expected higher growth rates contained increased expectations of interest incomes.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to accelerate at the end of the year.
The latest update gave little hope of accelerating inflation and low wage increases for households, which, according to the bank, would worsen even before it makes it better.
The bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" income from falling over the next few years, but it expects the payment to be "important" at the end of the three-year period.
The economy will also be strengthened by the strong growth in demand for British products as a result of a weak drop in consumption, which is reflected in the impact of a fall in private consumption.
Last year, after a year, the rates were calculated at 0.25% in response to the vote in the European Union, which fell into the bill of £.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to begin in prices and only after four years.
At the beginning of the recent decision by the central bank, interest payments had begun to be called for more and more when the inflation pressure on the households was increasing. In January, three decisions were required to raise the interest rate by 0.5%.
In the last month, inflation improved from 2.6 per cent in June to 2.9 per cent in June, but according to the bank, it was desperate and inflation was tightening again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the overrun of its 2% target was due to a "total" weak suit.
"In view of the recent fall in swap rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be tightening even more when lenders are looking for customers and making a year's notice," says Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers.
"Marks look very good for those whose agreement is at the end. The new agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also no less expensive options."
The number of 10,000 controversial drug users in the United States of America is estimated to be 10 000.
From September onwards, a "reversible" anti-HIV drug may be prescribed. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the public health system (NH).
NHS announced that PREP is estimated to account for approximately 10,000 people during the first three years of the trial, and that the risk of infection has been estimated to be reduced by approximately 86%.
NH agreed to finance an experiment after the Court held the Supreme Court’s last judgment, according to which the NH is entitled to pay for the PREP medicine, even though it is clear that the public should be able to justify it.
Simon Stevens, President of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday "a major new one" and was described by the National AIDS Organization as "a crucial moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, London, Sheffield and Sheffield will be the first to receive the announcements for an experiment that will expand in October to other clinics.
Prior to taking the anti-HIV medicinal product (PREP), which reduces the risk of infection, the exposure must be prevented.
The tests have shown that Prepe has a significant role to play in helping to maintain a high level of safety in risk groups.
The concomitant medicine means that during the interaction of the body there are the most appropriate substances in the body to prevent HIV infection.
You can take it daily or two days before you have sex.
The target group includes gay men, bisexual men and transgenders as well as people with HIV-positive partners who cannot be treated effectively.
Please refer to the criteria for the trial to be met by the applicants for male, female and transgender and for those who are not known to receive antiretroviral treatment for both HIV-positive diseases.
People living in England and who have been reported to be in public care can also ask for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
It costs 10 million pounds, and this week, the NHS signed a contract for medicinal products after the sale.
The purpose of the test is to assess the broad range of clinical evidence that the product is being taken, taken and managed, at the disposal of the Prep medicinal product.
"This important new development should complete and enhance the existing, modern and better-functioning means of achieving HIV", says Stevens.
"The only major step in the action that has been taking place for more than 30 years is to resolve mankind's biggest health challenge."
"This is a crucial element in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the World AIDS Organization.
"If treatment with Prep is actually directed towards those who need it and those who are at risk, then it may have a translation effect on their HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, the risk group includes an experiment funded by NHS, which they can choose to use without having to consult with a partner, which will have an effective effect on a very large number of lives.
This was welcome news."
"It is important to ensure that the experiment is launched immediately throughout the country and no one in danger falls within the scope of it," says Terrance Higgins.
"The PrEP used for testing has been acquired, and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people from HIV infection in risk groups."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event, which was extended for a long period of months due to the slowdown of the government," says Prime Minister Sharon Hodgson of the Prime Minister of State.
"We have evidence that the medicine can have a reversible effect on our work, which we are doing to prevent human beings and to stop the spread of this threatening disease.
u try to help us better understand the real benefits of the Prap medicine.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, so that we can protect the people who are alive and get back to the point where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of life: a small apartment in Earl's Court with a spacious home has been made between the middle floor and the smart interior solutions.
A former banker, Joanne Laig, who was responsible for real estate renovation, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller dwelling in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of Queen Anna's epoch house, and the success of the repair is told by the fact that Joan has not yet packed her clothes and moved her.
"That's what I used to live with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger place," says Joanne.
"I was eating something similar in my price class.
I was here in the dormitory, and I made sure that the rooms were as tall as my apartment at the time.
I immediately fell asleep and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, about 90 square square square flats have experienced a complete transformation.
It was a two-bed only from the kitchen, and it was a two-bed only.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired a job at the Duck & Shed Design Office in Erfan Azadin Notting Hill. Erfan was commissioned to use almost four-foot-old rooms and to create a flat, which would not only be a place to repair and sell but also a home.
The height of the room is not enough in two overlapping states, so the task was to build an intermediate layer of space where it was floating in the universe.
The solution required Erfan to make a creative sense of it.
"Terrhoidal structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be arranged in such a way that they did not need to be covered.
The structures had been modified so that the structure is just right on top and below."
Erfan was able to position the space together with two full-length rooms with all the details that fascinated them.
The step-by-step opens up the copper-style conversion of Retrouvius into a militarized space.
Mirrored furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille vintage lights create a characteristic style.
The use of mirrors brings teatality, space and light.
The mirrors on both sides of the hall make the mirrors on both sides of the hall seem to have a greater effect than actually on them.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a bed with a view to another room.
There is a storage room for Joanan’s meals and glassware in the mirrored furniture of the entrance.
What's more, you can hide the kitchen, you don't use it.
The furniture fitted with a pendulum is not a new solution,
But next to Joanne, it is unique that the door is raised as well as the door of the garage.
"It takes little planning", Erfan speaks of a steel-tight mDF door.
"It's balanced, so it's very easy to raise when it's getting up."
With the substantial state of play and the preparation of the storage situation, Joanne got 16 extras, a second bedroom and a better basis solution.
"When selling the place, the area determines – or the value of the property," says Erfan.
"In the underlying case, the real estate agent enters the apartment and calculates the price on the basis of the industry."
Joanne's share of the surface area was increased by the use of high-quality materials that bring about a space of luxury.
"The spouse is in contact with the property materials, and the emotional connection to the dwelling is partly based on them," says Erfan.
"no one is attached to electric wires in walls.
They are also important and not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good navigation and more organisms can make the home a living.
It may also be that the house no longer wants to move out of the house.
Princess Sofia, a pregnant princess, drowned in her summer class.
In Prisessa Sofia's residential area hit the button.
Prisessa Sofia represented Sweden in Båstad for the last time before her birth.
For the evening of the Asstainable Tomorrow event, the princess had chosen a light pink dress.
Sofia was represented on the occasion on a melody occasion.
Princess Sofia of Sweden has visited this area in Båstad, Sweden.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Tolorre seminar in a frantic blue-bodyed costume, which was the most recent princess in the world.
Sofia is about to happen in a dark and dark housing world.
This is the last representation event in which Sofia represents her appointment.
The end of the season is September.
For the event, Sofia had yet to choose a modern pastellin blue dress, which went down wonderfully.
The big earrings and the elegant little bag were crowned in style.
The kinky blue dress was a great princess.
Sofia has been on a mission trip to Båstad in Sweden this year.
Sofia grew up living in a little bag.
Sofia was actually in her fresh summer class.
Sofia entered the event, perhaps talking to photographers.
Now I'm just holding on to my stomach, Sofia said she was talking and referred to her final pregnancy.
Oh, we'll make you a sweet cup of tea.
There was a house where food from the country was sold to the Lahti market.
The Gulfers didn't dare to leave the country, they walked by.
Home food sold by Panya Suamsri-Penttilä, familiar with Panja.
The Finnish people did not know much about Finnish, and the Finnish still did not know Thai.
Because of not having the guts to go to dinner, Panja offered me a free meal.
He thus taught the Bays to eat Thai food, each at a time.
About the country, he said.
I'm stuck in the bag.
I went more and more often, every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened his Thai food industry in the Lahti Central Bank.
There were two small tables, I think they were under 20.
He also taught him not only to eat Thai food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When you're hungry and the places are limited, you can't leave no chair between yourself and a guest.
We got to know each other better and became friends.
Finally, at the end of the board, I sat down with a dictionary to learn Thai.
Two years went by the department of commerce, but then I had to change the game, because the spices made by myself are all over the place.
The center's head changed to a new place.
There's no way.
Now we jurors can sit on our own tables again, just in a few days we'll be shy to ask our guests, again.
Panja's description.
They're gonna tell him what happened and who he saw.
He knows what food each eats.
He's seen how the life cycles of the customers are changing and the food changes.
She remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first round.
He remembers you as thin and fat and remembers you as a young man.
It's nice to go to lunch a little bit longer than the others, sit at my place next to the door of the kitchen and change your hearing with the panja who leans on the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we want to eat.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chilic store.
He has opened up our taste for more of our minds and hearts.
Today, he's a Thai. He's an adult.
I hate Panjai.
Each one of them has been created, he is always there.
He's busy.
He's going to the restaurant, he's going to the house, and he's going to the black bag.
In the last summer, there was a slight 2 decades of fulfillment.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert.
No alarm or attention was given to this important day in the absence of work.
One from the underground base revealed the 173 Isis terrorist who were ready to strike Europe.
From the beginning of the year, the security was brought to grips with a significant stock of anti-terrorist work.
The list contains the information of more than 1 out of 1 Isis fighters who are about to attack Europe.

The current location and its contents have now been specified.
According to the paper, I was found by the military forces in a report on the identity and images of the detectives in an investigation into the underground situation of the United States of America in Estonia.

A suicide bomber is a specialty next to his image.
There is no specific information on the fate of the day.
Some 6,000 fighters have left Europe in line with Isis, which is not certain of their fate.
He fell below the surface in the Tokoinranta in Helsinki.
Based on the interviews of the Shelter, the man had wanted to show that he could swim.

According to Ville Estlander, senior fireman of the rescue facility, the situation was over as soon as possible.
Found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
He was found under the surface by a shelter divers, says Estlander.
The Sanctuary received a notification half past half past four o’clock.
The person was delivered to the primary care department.
Estlander says that he was a man of about 50 years old.
Based on the interviews, he wanted to seem to be able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander thanks the border guard and the police for their cooperation.
This was a task led by the Border Guard.
The players also guided the divers very well.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two cars were hit in Eura by nine people in the car, three were killed in a fatal manner.
There were a total of nine people in the car, the first of whom were injured less easily, the Chief Mayor.
Among the injured are both men and women.
An accident occurred at the crossroads of the five roads at four hours of day.
The accident occurred when another car turned to the 12rd of February for the second time, says Chief of Police Minister.
According to the Sanctuary, the transverse area has a distance of 80 km.
The companies are fighting for over USD 500 million in real estate.
The two brothers are arguing about Victoria's biggest real estate empire worth more than $1,000, which is connected to the family request of their Italian family 40 years ago.
Colin De Lutis, former president of the Carlton Watch Tower Society and real estate manager, lives in the Torahak territory of only two miles from his younger brother Paul. The younger brother has taken the highest dispute between the brothers about the division of real estate and business property.
Paul has wanted to leave the family already since 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
The brothers and their mothers together, they own 38 properties, which are worth more than half a third. For one, they began to collect property when they bought the Collingwood Smith Street street street in 19 Jul.
Home to Westco Jeans, which expanded to 160 businesses.
The chain was sold for 85 million dollars in 1999.
Money for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and housing in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as the front shopping centres.
According to the contract with the father who had gone to work, Colin owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and he owns about one-third of the company's assets.
According to the law, the distribution of assets means that Colin owns the real estate value of about 316 million dollars and the value of about 1 million dollars.
Paul is not happy to share real estate and money.
"I think Colin left his proposal for the best real estate," Paul wrote in his second voluntary testimony to court in 2015.
The case was last dealt with for the first time in the most recent court after hearings.
The brothers are now also arguing about the existence of an existing business.
Colin says that this is not true, and he blames Paul for the mismanagement of certain properties.
Colin is working on one of the first optional evidences that he wants to reach a conclusion on the matter.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, family is the most important thing to me," says Colin.
There are hundreds of pages of voluntary opinions, e-mails and reports, which are discussed by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer consultants, as well as the best and most experienced experts in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who founded pubs and fuses in the late 1950s. In the late 1970s, they bought a market in Brunswick.
It was insured to buy a real estate from Collingwood, where Colin founded his first farm sale.
Colin tells me that he has established a trade "in the last few years when he was still a child (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and in 2012 dead Luigi wants to transfer real estate to his sons in agreement.
"Lui often said that he didn't want the brothers to end up in justice," Anna says.
Two other boys, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lutis Group business. According to Colin, Mark got 10 million and Luke 26 dollars to leave the company.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark are "creative of the economic conditions of their origin".
Colin has kept a record, even though he was the former president of the Australian football league and the best friend of the television star Eddie McGuire this year, according to this year's death in 2015.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers at the same time.
Colinís. He only informed me in his text that it is not possible to comment, because it is being processed in law.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul is determined to challenge me and drag our family to the trial of justice," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin informed the court that he had tried to comply with his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue in this way", Colin continued and told us that he was still hoping to come to an end.
Friday's wish turned out to be gone.
"Our work will be decided in court in the near future", Colin writes.
A new staff chief intending to use the President's media.
They've tried.
Maybe John F. Kelly finally succeeds.
Yeah.
According to the Polico newspaper, the new head of staff in the U.S. House intends to promote the use of President Trumpi and monitor the news so that he does not get into so much trouble so often.
Editor Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new Head of Staff of the House, met with the staff on his first day of work, he spoke about the main problem he would like to resolve: he would like to thank President Donald Trump for his information.
It is clear from the above that all information, whether printed or public, must pass through him, because he does what he knows when he gets good knowledge."
Kelly's saying makes sense, but others have tried to re-enter the history of the world and have failed.
People Trump has the ratio of decades to sex — and, as a general rule, he still has a lot of sex.
"If the President Trump became nervous about unfair news, I was in favour of showing that the common media discussed more fairly", Sam Nun95, who worked as an adviser for the Trump campaign, told Politico magazine in the press.
Politico journalist Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "by six former campaign workers, it is essential that the use of Trump's information is controlled by the fact that personal media are heard in a smooth stream of strings".
Okay.
But it's ridiculous to assume that Trump's ultimate was ever in control.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that we others don't know – perhaps the Trump tweets without their efforts were even stronger.
We probably will never know what kind of messages Trummi will send without sending.
If his staff, once again, has been able to prevent him from causing a problem, their work has not been worth it.
However, it has not been possible to reasonably prevent Trump from causing a case.
The reason is that there are competing groups in the general house who are trying to drive their affairs by providing Trumbi with information that supports their vision. That information can be reliable — or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors were deliberately giving suspicious information to him.
An editor, Shane Goldmacher, told me about one of the cases:
"The current and the same workers in the drum say that he can be mad at the massive press journals where he is judged – especially if they are told about harmful data leaks, which is what he must know where the information came from.
That was the end of last month when one gave the second Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson's GotNews.com news site, where Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh was accused of several White House leaks.
Johnson had been permanently removed for the sake of harassment, and he had previously spread false attacks and removed them later. He also did not have any evidence to prove it.
Despite this, Trump had started the case after reading a question about the staff of the University."
Mr Goldmacher added that then the Head of Staff, Mr Reince Priebus, and Mr Rob Porter, the Secretary-General of the Internal House, "have tried to introduce a system for managing people going to the Trump".
And what was the result?
Lei tries the same three months later.
He may prove to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still a world of his own impulse and his assistants are still working on his own.
These unaltered facts make the task extremely difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract with PG for a period of five years.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract with the P.G.C. of the CSA, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday night, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid a price of EUR 222 million to the FC Barcelona on the same day.
Neymar's agreement with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and was free to move to another P.S.G.
The maximum amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the government history.
The last record was at the United States, which last summer was EUR 105 from the former Mr Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Public Works Investment.
The chairman will be a former professional worker, Mr Nasser al-Khehaifi.
Neym's belief is that Neym's arrival will be in Paris on a Friday.
The successful author, Raja Oranen, turned on alcoholism and fear of the plane with a hypnotic: "My life is in order".
About the TV show, the time of Rousun and the clean white sheets of a new writer, Raija Orane, just celebrated his 69th century.
Hypnotics from Raija Ora.
In addition to writing, five stepmothers keep the grandmother so that Raija and her husband Jyki gave up the sun and Fuengirola house after 18 winters.
First they sold their houses, but now they also went to rent a dwelling in the spring.
The light and the light, out of the old circles, Raijan was once taken by depression and the spiritism from which he has survived.
The inner essence is also 20 kilos lower.
The weight went down when serotonin was stopped, they were antidepressants.
I used to get help with alcoholism from hypnosis, which also worked on the plane, I won it.
I've been nothing for 15 years now.
Alcohol is an alcohol drink, the writer of the composer speaks openly.
Raja and Jyrki Oranen have been going on the same journey for over 45 years.
I know better than ever.
Raja and industry have been working together for over 40 years for Jyrki Oranen.
I did, and it was about to go in two weeks, Raija's name.
She has always been the queen of such a story, she has ceased to live her life from that, Jyki around.
The author of a major career Oranen remembers only well 44 parts of the pure white linen TV series, which touched and moved the depression-time Finland.
I finally decided on the branch of the Räika family's branch in the food industry when I read the 50th anniversary of Liisa Seppälän in the tabloid.
I was the daughter of the stitcher myself, and I also had a clothing store, and I sometimes acted as a mannequin, orane remembers.
He thought it was a plot and something changed the attitude of Finnish people towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Savel's research and anger revealed it, Oranen says.
Raija Oranen is an active author of active time, he has many manuscripts working under - ideas for hundreds of years.
Circulators returned over "millimetres in the alley".
The wealthiest houseowners in the West Midlands are once again in the back of their hair again with persistent lands that managed to cross the central government's well-informed ditch and return to the adjacent fields of the houses.
Turned cars parked a couple of apartments a million-dollar alley near the street in Soliju.
They were driven away from the region in May, but they were able to cross the guard they needed to prevent the city from getting in. They brought with them, the house, and the army of the vans.
The cyclists managed to overcome the vehicle barrier at a point that was left unprotected for the sake of protection.
The fierce inhabitants have accused the municipality of Solihein of "creating a complete inability.
The nameless resident tells us that they have come from Bentley Heath on Monday night, where they were passing through the stone.
"When you have to work hard, because it seems to be a complete match for the problem.
The tourers were here on May, then they left but returned again.
They're more and more.
According to a resident, the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"I'm on the Streetsbrook Road, and it's too hard to pay the municipal tax when the municipality can't do anything about it."
It is ridiculous, with one of the nameless staying residents, that the rest of the worlds will return as soon as they were driven away.
"There are more and more of them, and they've even landed a horse to land in the park."
According to Solihu's municipal informant, the municipality is aware of the wrong camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are about to take action with Soihu's police to get you to camp as soon as possible.
For the purpose of collecting the evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible make the police aware of the significant or serious conduct of the police.
It makes the idea of how to create a whole image for the purpose of court-martialing."
The many people who had become imploded by the Portuguese machine were in a state of disarraying the Portuguese machine.
In Portugal, men who have been forced into forced labour in Portugal have been tried today in court.
The second two people were the result of the forced indictment.
Machines two men can be charged with the death penalty.
At most, it is possible to obtain 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
A man-made small machine was making a technical mistake yesterday, and I was forced to go to a nearby Sao Joao da Caparica in the vicinity of the home.
There were hundreds of people on the beach at the time, some of whom ran from the landing machine to escape into the water.
On landing, the machine hit a 56-year-old man and a 8-year-old girl who died immediately.
The machine first hit the man who was on the back of the machine.
As soon as the machine went up and went down again, it hit the head, told the newspaper Filipe Joira Joral de Noticias at the beach.
The dead little girl was at the beach with her parents.
The girl wasn't hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded me with anger after the crash.
The girl's mother and other people went to the machine and started beating it up, reported a case in Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called me a "man", and he was desperate.
It is a wonder that there is no more human beings.
The two men on the plane did not get hurt in forced labour.
The Finnish leader who tragically lost his leg won the World Cup again: "No mission would be the world."
Matti Suur-Hamari is hosting early on Wednesday morning in the Middle East, Finland.
The Grand Hamar also won the cross of the MM gold in the contests before.
All the MMs have now come to three.
I can't believe the MM contests.
Once treated with honey, with a pretty good heart rate pulled, the aim of the Great Hamari was to win.
The 30-year-old figure thanked her coach and was very successful at returning to Finland.
According to Nagy-Hamar, the number of participants is growing all the time.
The entire panel has grown and developed very much lately.
The differences are small, and there are a lot of new shots involved.
He always wondered if a black horse would come after him.
Every single one seems to be a different winner.
Major-Hamari lost his second voice in the engine accident in 2009.
He had been eager to count with his friends since he was a young man, and he did not want to get into the rink.
I mean, it's like, at times, it's like, "What's your life?"
But my attitude has always been that I'm sorry if I'm done.
They play with the cards that are divided, the Great Ha emphasizes.
It would be difficult to make a serious contribution and lose your limbs a lucky break, and Great-Ham will not do so.
But he turned to terrible difficulty.
Yes, I said it worked out.
I wouldn't be a triple world.
Prior to the guarantee, the biggest sit-down in the 22-year-old Big Ham was already on the run.
D northwards the end of the journey really did not arrive until after the accident.
When I was a kid, I used to have sex with a guy, and we always got excited about X-Games.
But they were far-fetched dreams, which were agitated over a period of time.
After the accident, I'll figure out who I am somewhere from the X-Games start.
I couldn't have imagined it in advance.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a really long life if I came here to rub off and push.
I decided to pull the hats on and get to work.
I think I'm pretty good.
The counter was very excited about the choice of a biker from the Leo-Pekka Star as a sportsman for the year.
The fourth Olympic winner won his prize in the sports game in January.
The Great Hamar says the star victory is for the parasperity.
It was a big deal, and victory was definitely earned.
This will certainly also open up eyes to the world of para-sportsmanship.
When is it time to launch the dual world's Matthew the Great-Hamar year's hero campaign?
I'll see you later.
I will do my best to succeed.
Great Hamari has not taken over all the peaks he desires.
This year's goal is here.
One day at the paralympics in South Korea.
Let's go get some medals.
The majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently unless the Union ends up and Isa leaves the country of origin.
The Ace for Young Syrian Refuges study looked at the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees cooking bread at the refugee camp in Jordan, Syria.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their home country permanently.
The end of Syria and the departure of Daddy from the country are among the most important things that should take place so that they can return to their country of origin.
The Truming regime does not seem to bring about any change to the Syrian conflict.
The Communication Office Burson-Marsteller discussed the opinions and attitudes of young refugees in an international study.
Burson-Marstelli has already studied the opinions and attitudes of the Arabs in nine years.
This year's A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees study discussed the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
In February-March 2017, the survey was carried out by a total of 400 young Syrians aged 18-24, half of whom are women and half are male.
Half of the interviews were conducted in Jordan and half of the interviews.
According to research, over half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
42% of respondents may ask that they return to their home country and 4% could not say.
According to the survey, the number of young people in the country of origin and the number of persons in the country of residence is active.
Almost half ( 4 %) considers the end of the world to be the most effective factor in the long-term return, while one quarter of them think it would be most important to leave the country.
Only the tenth part of the population will make it the most important factor in the process of economic improvement or the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military operations do not single conflict conflict.
The Syrian youth was asked what the factor is for the end of the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the world is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad.
The fair fourth holds the President of Al-Assad as an obstacle to the peace agreement.
Almost everyone experiences that both political and civil solutions are needed to end the current Syrian conflict.
The solution to conflict by means of simple measures is not only a fair fourth.
The majority of Syrian refugees sees Isis in power during the past year, while the third sees it with power.
According to respondents, the most important thing about Isä, and generally against belief, is that the media would pass on information to the country that Isis has nothing to do with Islam.
Almost as many people have raised as the first means of the main measures and the reform of education.
A fair tenth of all, in the opinion of young people, it would be important to create better jobs for young people.
When asking about Trump's administration, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the Trump regime.
Almost every four people believe that the Syrian conflict is getting worse in the Trumpi period.
The opinions are divided in two ways as to whether or not the actions taken by Poland as well as by Iran have made the conflict worse or worse.
Multi-Widenius spends half the time coded to keep the Internet in order - his database, for example, Wikipedia and Google, is being developed by him.
The European Enterprise MariaDB is developing an open source database for "the most important in the world".
The main product of the MariaDB, founded by Michael "Monty" Widenius, does not pay the user anything, and it can be developed online by any working author.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying users.
Databases allow the largest number of databases to be kept in order and up-to-date.
If you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, for example, they use the MariaDB or the database.
"All information that is not in the image format comes from the database, and the images are also linked to the site," explains Widenius.
Wedenius, who is the CEO of MariaDB, spends about half the time giggling.
A man who works far away from Kaunias with his hands should make sure that the Internet works smoothly.
Wedenius developed the most popular open source database in the world along with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, Sun, a company that bought $1,000 in 2008 and one year later, it was softwareed by Oracle for your greedy Sun 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade took place, most of the developers reported leaving.
"They did not want to work for Orale, who did not promise a future of the promise," Wedenius recalls.
He had already set up a company at this stage to develop MariaDB.
You don't want your life's work dying.
I hired the best of the best of the Top two and thus made sure that the continuity of the code is secured by the same friends that created it.
Since there is an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to move.
A foundation was established for the development of the MariaDB code to control the development of the MariaDB code.
"With MySQL, these inspections were not carried out," Wdenius regrets.
Many people have heard about Widenius and the international trade, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the last few years, our growth rate has been around 50% per year," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CEO of MariaDB.
The growth-oriented MaryDB does not yet make any profits, and Paqvalén is weak about the company's key figures.
To the extent that he reveals that the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that he will receive 20 million euro for orders.
As the database is free, the company has developed it around the services that customers are willing to pay for.
MariaDB will also help to exchange databases, which may be a project over a year if the customer has created a closed database.
The exchange of information between MariaDB and MariaDB will take place at the moment because they are versions of each other.
Among other things, the external operator Telefónica and the largest bank DB in South-East Asia are MariaDB's paying customers.
The most common cloud services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Albaban Cloud, offer approximately MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically distributes to new users Linux operating systems in transmission packages where MariaDB has largely replaced MariaDB.
We're small, we've got each other's biggest games.
"Our customers are among the world's largest telecommunication operators, gaming companies, banks and even one central bank", the Paqvalé list.
Databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP are still in place in their closed databases.
Oracle is also a modest side business in comparison to the company’s most recent database.
Although according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies have lost their market share in recent years, in terms of turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, although they are fast-growing stalls.
About 50 billion dollars in the database market, open source databases do not exist to billions.
However, the weight of the open source cannot be measured only in money, because most users do not have anything on this software.
The company Gartner predicts that in 2018, more than 70% of its internal applications are already using open databases.
In addition, more than half of the old databases would have been replaced or at least started at that time.
Households do not receive new customers, as most of them choose the next open source code.
This implies that the fees for commercial databases have jumped to the cloud.
Any person who wants to make as much money as he did in the past with a smaller amount of cash," Wedenius wondered.
Since changing the closed database is a nuisance, most of the customer companies have been listening to price increases.
"There are many customers to whom it is really difficult to move, because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database," says Widenius.
He still believes that customer measurement is on the way.
Where licence fees are increased every year, the user will sooner or later enter the open source database.
The price is 10-20% of the previous price, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wants to.
Besides, many companies are already facing major system changes when they move to cloud services.
A lot of people change their database database.
Last spring, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Central Bank (ECB) from the EIB.
It was the largest ever increase in EIB’s income in the Nordic countries.
On a global scale, the company has around 115 employees and is now expected to generate more employment.
One of the reasons for the EIB’s financial contribution was the impact of MariaDB on public procurement.
The company has public customers in, for example, the United Kingdom and Germany.
The public sector in Europe is paying billions of euros per day from databases.
"Many countries are going to move into open-source solutions and use tax money more efficiently", says Paqvalén.
It is a shame that Finland spends money on, for example, fixed health care systems, when the open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the expense of one of the computer companies.
Some people say that the open code is ideology, but I think it's a better way to do the code.
help and do something that you can't or can't do.
The 55-year-old Widenius is one of the most well-known open-source promoters in addition to Linus Torvalds, the other Finnish developer, who is Linux.
Wedenius helps other companies to develop operating business models at an open source.
I still have 4-5 speeches a year from all over the world about this subject.
It also strengthens the attitude of civil society towards the role of civil society in the role of the civil society.
It has asked non-governmental organisations, who are in favour of refugees in the Mediterranean, that they should not carry out their activities unless they commit themselves to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If non-governmental organisations do not commit themselves to the new Code of Conduct, it is hard to see how they will continue their activities," said Minister of State Marco Minniti in the interview of the Torinou La Stampa newspaper.
The minute warning came the day after the Italian authorities had confiscated the German Jugend Rettet relief ship, which was suspected to be working with human smugglers who contributed to illegal immigration.
During the course of the year, the agency that has been active has requested to comment on the detailed accusations of prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the survival of lives is and will be the most important thing, and we are very sorry that we are currently not working in the search and rescue area," reports the community in its public opinion on media.
"We will only be able to assess the attacks if we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to determine the situation."
The French authorities had been aware of the Iuventa vessel of the Jugend Rettet organization since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken on board a ship in a number of places, in fact, from the transporters of human beings, who re-introduced them.
One of these cases is claimed to have occurred just a few kilometers away from the coast.
The crew is suspected to have been attacked by the 18 patrols, which control the rescue operations in the area, and is considered to be motivated by the enthusiasm for assistance.
According to the instructions, Iuveta must be involved in Italian politics, which monitors the operation.
So far, only three of the nine non-governmental organisations involved in search and rescue activities have agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and the original Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which, on Thursday, announced that it considered new rules to be harmless but acceptable because they do not cause "labelling changes or obstacles" to the civil protection activities.
Among those who refuse to follow the instructions, Nobel is the award-winning Fat Without Borders Organisation.
On the other hand, he concluded that the number of movements that have arrived in Italy during the course of the rescue operations has fallen sharply over the last few weeks, as he considers it to be an indication that action to establish the Bibli National Guard and to cooperate with the local captains are starting to produce results.
"In the last days, the light of vision has begun at the end of the tunnel," said Minister.
He revealed that the plans continue this month to discuss economic development projects with the Presidents of Libya, as well as with Chad, Niger and Mali, which will enable us to set up a number of refugees to leave the country.
The seasonal worker is suspected to have killed an outlying spouse at Enontekö, suspected of being from the countryside - a case for the D.A.
Suspect's murder occurred at the Enontekiö Käts last December.
According to him, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected to have killed a 26-year-old Scottish wife-in-law.
It has been said in the past that both were seasonal workers.
He has also said that the suspect would have fled with two dogs to the ground after he had done so.
Found in a frozen countryside, and he did not resist when caught up.
The case must be brought up in less than a week.
It may be possible to demise in the District Court of Ori during the course of the month.

The British actor, Robert Hardy, is at the age of 91.
The observer's observation was announced by this family on Thursday.

Michelle Carter, 20, executes her 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
In June of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Court of Justice of the European Union committed murder on 13th October.
"My family is broken," Conrad's father said in Thursday's session.
"My son was my best."
He appealed to the judgment and was able to wait for an application to be made in good time.
He threatened 20 years of judgment, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy are suffering from mental health problems.
A man in a hot and cream-coloured shirt listened to his judgment hand in the hands of a weeping eye created on the ground.
"Whoever they do kill Conrad Roy," the D.A. said to the court.
"He decided to make Conrad his own life known to him.
It is not the responsibility of doing it", the D.A. continued.
"He has not proved judgment."
According to Carter's lawyer, the case was caused by "the conditions under which Carter is deeply aware".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity and not even mental problems had a significant impact on his actions".
The D.A. wrote to Conrad's mother Lynn Roy's statement, in which she said, "I'm not going to miss out on my beloved son's death."
I want him to be an excuse for me and for how I get through this. I am very happy with his sister in this conversation, which we will always bear."
Conrad's father, Camdyn Roy, told the court that he was "the only" idea that he would never see his brother's wedding and not be his aunt's child.
"It's an Angelic world, it's been a day since I'm here, it's not ever going to happen," said Camdy.
The case seems to be a precedent, since there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that would be instigating suicide.
Kar was 17 years old when Roy was found in the car when he was found in an infertility investigation in 14 years.
The event attracted national attention when it came to the fact that in his text, Carter had encouraged himself to do so.
"Get off yourself, jump off the roof, stab the mind. I don't know, there are many ways", Carter in a lot of messages he had sent to Roy during the last two months of this death. Roy was at that time away with his family.
Just for a while before Roy's human life, Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and free."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention on Roy's mind. He ordered that Carter would not benefit from the case by making interviews.
The way has been shared by a group of opinions.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British apartment in Italy in 2007.
The Los Angeles Times wrote Knox's paper of opinion, where he says, "What Carter needs is compassion and help, it doesn't listen."
NATO Secretary-General: You're the worst in Russia in the world than the worst in the last days.
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, comments NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stalten was responsible for the situation in Ukraine and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I can imagine that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would strive to work closely with Moldova.
In particular, since the introduction of the crime in 2014 and the unusual instability of Russia in the eastern region, NATO's relationship with the situation has been seriously deteriorated.
Still, according to Staltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so so that the voltages do not get tighter in the world.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in dialogue with the Russians in order to ensure that we are back down and that we are in a fresh world.
Comments by Staltenberg from the United States President Donald Trump points to a dangerously poor level between the United States and the US.

Makes a final change to 850 000 diesel engines because of the accident caused by the accident of the car manufacturers.
Before the day-to-day announcement, the MFN offered an update of more than 35,000 software.
The Director-General said that the company believed that "there are no more options than driving restrictions", he referred to European cities, including the home of the town of Munich, which seek to restrict or prohibit the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes engines in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies made a call for back.
European car manufacturers have made a significant contribution to the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and to the achievement of the objectives of climate change.
Nitrogen oxides from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The installation costs of emission-absorbing devices are rising, making it difficult to price cars competitively.
German car manufacturers are being monitored in advance, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been charged with driving and passing large cars.
Operators are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes. Volkswagen installed in cars cheating devices that reduced emissions to meet the requirements in the test. In normal driving, emissions were higher.
Several of the Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but their activities are being investigated across the Atlantic.
During the month, the former Director of thermodynamics of the Audi Minister-General was arrested in Germany.
Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for possible purposes.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in the Volkswagen investigation. The authorities suspected that Audi had installed in its cars a system that could be used to meet European emission standards. The reason was based on another United States of America.
The hearing can significantly undermine the position of Volkswagen: the proportion of luxury car manufacturers in Volkswagen's profits is disproportionate.
The vote in Venezuela was initiated by a covert investigation, big demonstrations in the permit.
According to each of them, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least greater than the number of actual voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the outcome of the election, the chairman of the National Election Commission, Tibisay Lucenan, said to journalists.
Maduro convinces the crisis to go away.
On Sunday, in a controversial vote in Venezuela, a settlement was elected for the purpose of changing the world's world.
The Opposition has strongly criticised the vote and arranged for its amendment to the demonstrations against it.
The opposition against Madro has pushed the mind to its demonstrations in such a way that they would be called.
According to El Pais, the country’s national security forces began to take over the country’s Parliament on Wednesday morning.

Climate change is a threat to Provence's lavender.
Lavender has become a symbol of the Southern French Provencen symbol, but now it is equivalent to climate change.
Laveltel had become a few because of droughts and insects suffering from diseases, and researchers and farmers are eager to find a solution to the problem.
"The stage is, in fact, a threat in the Provence region because it has suffered in recent years from diabetes, and since then, the rainfalls of spring and autumn have fallen clearly," says Eric Chaisse, a specialist at the CRIEPAM farm in Provence.
"This delays the lavender's lifetime.
The drought has brought in a lot of small heaps that are spreading micro-bacteria."
The odds are high.
Lavender attracts tourists, and it is also a very desirable part of perfume and cosmetics.
"In place of long larvae and large flowers, we now have smaller flowers, which are weakly developed or lost or all of them," says Sheikh.
"In other words, there are fewer parts of the essential oil."
The solution is sought more effectively by watering, by evaporating soil moisture, and by fueling plants with a protective clay and water solution. In addition, we are developing dry products that are better able to cope with them.
The journalist's story is a threat to the future.
The submission of the Riodoce newspaper, which appears once a week, will usually meet on Wednesdays to find out how the most recent cases of organised crime, corruption and last-minute drug war in the United States are being investigated.
However, I am discussing this because of the recent tragedy.
Operators have been encouraged to change their daily routines.
The two experienced journalists will discuss which one is more important: leave home or take them with them in the delivery that was made in 2009.
Security experts have written to the panel at the front of the room three words: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask suppliers for names for each group; they do not need proof, they need insights and knowledge.
The article describes the names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, who are suspected to be on the payroll of the government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make the news of the chaos of the transition dangerous to the public.
According to the Consumer Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered after President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012 in the Federal Republic of Estonia in the protection of 5 journalists who were attacked and threatened, and at least seven journalists have been murdered in the United States in the following year.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, founder of Riodoke, journalist and inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote together about many of his books on drug abuse.
The top of the Riodone building is covered with a huge picture of Valdez showing the middle finger. The picture says: "Justice." Thirty-year-old editors Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have put on T-shirts that decorate Valdez's muddy faces. Valdez has eyes and a death hat made into a trademark.
The meeting will take place less than two months after Valdez's death, and journalists will discuss their fears of trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness and paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up, in particular for the purpose of dealing with cases involving journalists, but according to the Consumer Protection Committee, only two reasons have been raised so far.
Criminals are only often entitled to justice, as is the case for certain murders related to trafficking and organised crime on an annual basis.
Riodoc's editors intend to continue writing about the violence in Sheiloa, even though they are sad and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibara, there is little use of the Security Conference because the killers are not known and there is no hope for justice.
"This meeting is literally a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left Riodoce's delivery in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on 15 May 17.
He had only driven a couple of blocks away from his new Toyola when two men killed him and forced him out of his car and shot at twelve shots. It was supposed to be related to the title of the book: Riogie means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away in Valdez's car and crashed it a few miles away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She's going to die and two grown-up children.
Rumors are moving in and out of Culacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a fad of silence.
Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competitive groups want to fill the void.
One or more people are shot to death on the street every day, and the cemetery has a decoupling two-storey two-storey tomb buildings, which are bigger than many homes.
There is a "serious" in the U.S. border states when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Riodoke, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez felt guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes were committed to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Mr. Damaso Lopez's interview led by a competing group that is going to fight against the Guzman boys.
The case could be upset with the Guzman boys: the customers suspected of being part of the gang bought each single issue as soon as the magazine arrived at the point of sale.
The other mistake was that Valdezia was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in the U.S. and abroad, and his murder is considered to be the opposite of journalists in violence against violence.
He had learned so many things that he and his people could no longer fear for him.
He had a long career in Noroese when he decided in 2003 to start a three-third Riodonen with him, and the shares in the magazine were sold for $50 at that time.
Bojorquez says, "It was impossible to make journalistism without addressing the drug problem."
In time, the magazine began to feel confident and informed about its stories, and its sales and advertising income increased.
Journalists appreciated the opportunity to develop high-class researching journalism without fear of being so big, and readers were fascinated by the articles in the paper that no one else dared to publish.
After eight years of its creation, Riotane won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her promotion in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received a single freedom of expression from the Consumer Protection Committee for his assurance to follow the story of drug trafficking in Mexico without delay.
He openly expressed his suspicions.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said in knowledge of the Ministerial Protection Committee's prize.
Drug trafficking is at the Skälolo, Valdez said at the Rompeviento TV interview last year.
"The operator must accept the task that he will do... or act as an actor.
I don't want anything to do to tell you where I was when I was sitting in this place, and I didn't want to tell you what was going on."
Riodoc's staff want Valdez — a joker who cursed like a maid who needs a friend who always had mercy and advice. They need a teacher who knows how to understand.
They trusted him in his routine.
He always made a creed.
He held a counter-opportunity at the El Guayabo Bar and always sat at the same table.
They are now asking if the routines have come to his end.
Colleagues have also made them wonder how they can best do their work and survive.
"The criminals don't like it when we deal with our stories about their children and their children and their clean transactions, they hide their drug trafficking in their bonnets.
They were excluded from the case," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-construction and self-preservation,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not all right, you have to stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, the editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the impression can be deceived, and so in the case of Javier".
The old rules are no longer valid in Sõhalo, nor are they valid in Tamaulpas, Ferraruz, Guerrero and other worlds with networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The environment is changing constantly.
A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only the government's spying programmes had been followed by activists and contractors.
Outside the building, two police officers had applied for protection from 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
The State had ordered them to secure Riodoce's premises located in a four-story building in the middle-sized area of Culiacan.
Part of the reporters were half-gamed, whether these two policemen were part of the 50 percent number that the governor did not consider to be a match.
It has been months since journalists had visited a mountainous country under the control of drug gangs.
The delivery of this week's paper scheduled for three main events.
The size of the box was 96io Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in the Bargain.
The press also wanted to reveal that government finances had been concentrated in the governor's hometown.
In addition, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, just a block from the D.A.'s office, was kidnapped by a number of people.
It was not official to know who had been kidnapped and how, so we had to be careful: everyone around the world knew that the product was in the best interest of both drug dealers and authorities.
The editor learned from the public documents that the tender had been registered under the names of a politician from the competent institutional revolutionary (PRI) department. PRI has been managing policies at all levels for a further century.
Governors belonging to it have recently been charged with corruption in cases of high public access.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous cases in the same place. One of them "El Chapo" Guzman's exorcism succeeded in obsessing and avoiding an army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that Valdez's column had access to reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known by now what had happened," says 46-year-old Villarreal, who has been given the nickname "El Flaco", Shokainen because of his thin transformation.
"Now all connections to our data sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been converted into a warehouse for keeping signs and stickers against persecution by operators. The magazine workers have created a new, unexpected task: they have become freedom of expression activists.
Editor Miriam Ramirez took along with him the next morning at the departure of a few signs for a demonstration by the local D.A.'s office responsible for the murder of another journalist again.
Mene disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was murdered.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found, which is Adame based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In a demonstration of the signs of "SOS Press" appear in the corridors and in the buildings.
Director Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to get the full support for the Valdez case.
The day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists for telling the truth.
He's finally explained that he's getting away from the government cases, because he's concerned that he can't be an object of hatred.
Valdez had once again found that in Mexico operators are living in organised crime, crime is permitted by public and indirect society.
In his last book Drugjournalism Valdez, he writes that drug gangs are killing workers, but they are also being killed for the purpose of the police and security forces in the common understanding with organised consciousness.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on journalists last year were being carried out and carried out.
"Why don't people be silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
Killer's got a depression.
no one will ever forget the death of blogger Maria 108 Macas in the north of Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
There was a message from the Zetas cartel near ölsa: "I'm here for my articles."
The head cut off was computer keyboards and headphones.
Some of the newspapers have decided to cease their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper in the north of the Chihuahua border state, after the March murder of Miroslava Breach, a correspondent in the post-March border state.
He can continue his activities, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, even though its director was accused in April 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on the website of the drug cartels: "What do you want us to do?"
Some of the suppliers have fled their country or country.
It's hard. It's hard.
There is a real need to find work in Italy, and we must be on guard all the time.
Cops are looking for a reporter, as apparently visited by photographer Rube Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a meeting in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he had escaped from Verarruz.
For those who continue their work, the day is full of difficult decisions.
Ibarra, who was supposed to become a poet, feels that writing about drugs scares me.
"I became a reporter because I'm going to hell," he says.
Sometime ago, the editors of Riodoce sat at the front of the delivery in front of the doorway with beer when the newest issue had been completed.
19 people were killed in the shooting between competing gangs and the security forces at Mazatlant's beach house.
The war accelerated, as promised in remote map messages in the region.
The editors placed the news on the website of the Riodogen on their mobile phones.
We had to do it again the next day.
The sirens are giggling in the vicinity - another shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked forward to the arrival of guarded police officers:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
Riodocen continued the tradition of the murderer’s founder under this massive image of the man’s fingertips to the whole of Skälo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even consider putting an end to the operation. "How could I stop the paper when our intern asked you to go to the street to do the thing the same day Javier was told?"
Hannu Manninen's Christmas project began with a huge return to "The Hard Place".
In April, 39-year-old Hannu Manninen’s parties were short-lived, since the inspector started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began in a disastrous manner when Manninen got sick in the flu.
It became a long period of observation, which took about five weeks to reach the age of five.
May went into practice in a state of complete illness.
At first, it was an influenza and, finally, a baby’s disease like an encephalitis that I had to eat in an antibiotic course.
I was only able to do 10% of the planned activities.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick.
It's a tough place when I didn't get the opportunity to practice, so Manninen tells Ila-Sanom.
Test result for Monday
The 2007 World World Cup was granted a training license until the second week of June, which took place on 12 June in the KIHU Roll Test Centre for Racing and Top Sports.
In the test, a sportsman skis on roller skates, which are grown every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the mat stops for about eight seconds, and the tester takes a sportsman's fingertips to the sample with a needle.
In the first period, 32 minutes away, but now I only survived 28 minutes.
I've got a head up against the wall, Manninen's gonna tell me.
Right direction
After the beginnings, Manninen tells us that she has remained healthy.
I have carried out several, peaceful, aerobic exercises that have sought to normalise the body’s metabolism.
It's a really good five-week period back here.
It was also a celebration of a week and a half of aviation work.
I also had time to go to the cabin with my work.
In the last month, Manninen only participated in four World Cup competitions before the Lahti World Championships.
The best result was first seen in the opening contest when Manninen came up to the top of the ski.
The direction indicator is pulled.
Petter Kkäkkonen, head coach of the Mann and the national team, has made a practical and competitive plan for the next few years.
We are now applying for a different rhythm during the last period of the interview.
After the competitions in Lume, Ruka would have three world Cup Games in Finland.
In December, at least one of the world’s cup nights, perhaps in St. Stephen’s, would be part of December.
In January, the plans would still be in Seefeld.
Since then, the name will be at the top of the Olympic team," Manninen says.
The Olympics in Pyongcang would be Manninen's tenth annual Winter Olympics by now.
The most important thing now is to stay healthy, in Salt Lake City, 2002 and the next round of events in the team competition.
Dinosaur protected himself from his enemy by disguised masking.
In the beginning, it looks like an awesome statue.
Now the researchers have revealed the first research results found by a Canadian miner in a sarcasm of a sizeable creature that was so well preserved that experts call it the Mona Addi of the dinosaurs.
It was so well enough that researchers could even determine that its sublime skin was red-brown and had been "the work of the future".
According to Current Biology magazine, it is the best-preserved, armed dinosaur and the best representatives of its entire world.
The recently discovered fossil is nodosaurus, which was 110 to 11 million years ago in the middle of the day.
Researchers consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a very significant discovery.
According to the National Héfic magazine, the brewed vegetarian is alive for all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Canada on 21 March 2011 and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
He hit someone who did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding rock, and decided to examine the finding further.
The fossil from the rock was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tyrell.
For six years, the beast was dug out of a 100-pound block.
The results of the hard work are now visible.
"If you tighten your eyes, you can believe that it was in your sleep," says journalist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher in the Royal World of Tyrell.
"It remains in science's history of dinosaur Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and preserved dinosaurs in history.
The skin study found that the meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to be a major threat to the vegetable feeder, since it was a rifle and was similar to a gun park.
Its red-white weapon masks it from predators and also protects it from darker and thiner colours, which still exist in many animals.
According to experts, it was thus better able to blend into its environment and avoid its enemies, the larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosah rose in May, and it is now on display in Tyrrell's Royal Paleontological Universe.
Researchers have given it the name Borealo to markmiteller according to Mark Mithell. Mitchell was part of a team that took more than 7,000 hours to find a dinosaur.
Nodosaurus has been so amazing that Mitchell and the international researchers' team have been able to determine the image and shape of the body’s scales and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the world by coloring, darker and lower.
It was still a surprise, however, because Borealapa is much larger than the present ones with the same colouring.
It can be concluded that the meat-eating dinosaurs preyed on it so that evolution favours hiding instead of helping it.
The present animal, for example, is the same colour as the pegro, zebra, and acharadillas, which are significantly smaller and therefore the most powerful, which suggests that nodosing was also at risk.
"The exposure of the great, strongly armed dinosaur tells us how big the dinosaurs of the day were," says Brown.
A chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the nodosaur swamps reveals that its skin was red-brown.
Scientists will continue to study nodosaurs in order to draw conclusions from its life. They will examine, among other things, its ling to find out what it is at the last.
Scientists believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drifted to the sea where it sank into the sea.
Alberta was at that time as warm as it was today in Florida, and rivers and seas are likely to understand much more than they do now.
"This nodosaurus is really important because its Finnish leather has survived and has survived three-dimensionally in its original form," Brown says.
"That's why it seems to be similar to that of an early marriage period.
Its drawing does not require a lot of imagination: if you stretch a little bit of your eyes, you can believe it was in your life."
The day was the time of the theropods, the vast twin-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Even though their king, Tyrnosaurus rex, i.e. thousands of years before Borealola, its mighty men may have captured this armored dinosaur.
For example, Tyrandusvar rex's arrivals included Acrocanthosaurus, a six-tonne long six-tonne radius of approximately 11.5 metres.
The latest findings of Nodosaurus researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, which believes that Borealopa was washed into the sea after the flood and mumbled into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in northern Canada on 21 March 2011 and was discovered by a miner named Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s surviving armoured dinosaur with its skin and its tanks from the dead to the hip.
The average length of the nodosaurs was five long and weighing up to 1 300 kg.
There was a two-mile pitch out of the plates.
Researchers believe that this armored vegetarian passed through the current West Canada until the flooded river transported it to the open sea.
Its armor has survived to some detail in the seaside tomb.
Its fossilised remains have survived so well that its skin is still in the tank’s pile of plates along its skull.
Michaelhko in both National University magazine says that the survival of Europe is "one of the most common in terms of winning the lottery.
The more he thinks, the more amazing it feels.
There's still fossilized leather in the back of that skull in the back of the sheet.
Its right advantage is at its back, five toes up.
I'm also going to guess the mucks on the top of the floor."
How does one author learn to answer the question: Who are the streets for?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply upset on 9 August 2014.
He had arrived at his home in St. Louis one day earlier in New York and was sitting on his airbnb apartment, watching Facebook on his phone.
Then he looked at the message from the high school database:
"I was just 18 years old, and his body is still on the street."
He was confused to find out that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, which is why he shut down the computer and opened it up.
There were a number of retwisties at the time from @TheePharohah.
The username belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis, who tweeted in real-time from the death of Michael Brown. The police had fired an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in the State of the Missouri state of Ferguson.
The user had also posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell said.
The world was nothing new to him and to him.
When he returned the other day, he was told that he was dying in Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of police closing threats and calling people and the man who made Brown look like a man in the village who said, "The hell of Ferrusson is just killing my son!"
Frell followed a real-time video film where he was standing with the dog that was barking at the protesters.
He also tells me that he saw a video where the other police opened their rifles and cried, "I'll kill all of you...
"This is not normal", Ferrell remembers he's true.
"it wasn't the kind of murder that we've already gotten used to and that we could say was compatible with.
Cold colors at the time.
I was going and I was going."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at 11 a.m., and Ferrell went to pick up his six-year-old father's father's house and decided to leave for Ferguson the next morning.
About what happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson in the last three years, a documentary film was produced "Whose Streets?". It was first produced in cinemas on 11.8.2017.
The film is a picture of the survival and the manifestation, love and loss, as well as the strength and sinisterness of all the local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Frell drove to Fergh to the florist and compatible with his daughter, they again discussed "what is living as black skin and under what circumstances." They had talked about it countless times before that time.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers what he said.
"We're going to Fergusani because the police are killing a 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I can't help but think about it," Ferrell told me later.
"Today's events are... the climax of past events.
My daughter has a right to know it and to live on it.
He must have the capacity to act and to be organized, but he must also know the different terms and conditions of living as a black man, and he must know what we need to do to get rid of ourselves.
Fortunately, though, I've managed to protect you from a blatant racist, he's just like the rest of them.
I feel like I would hurt myself if I were really protecting reality."
The first stop in Ferguson was South Florissant Road, which is located near the station, which became a campplace for activists when they were waiting for information on the handling of the case and obviously knew that there would be no reason for it.
That's where Ferrell and his people went from the local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to the protestors.
Frell was about to take action in a new way.
"The activism changed completely after 9 August", he says. During his study at the University of Missouri, St. Louisis Ferrell was chairman of a minority of nurses' organisations, which focused on food rights and health inequalities in the black community.
"I had no experience in organising.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell in the last presentation Sabah Folayan, the assistant director of the document.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrrar "wanted to tell you what was happening".
He asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you have a story that you can use?"
On the basis of the suspicions, the great times when people had appeared in the local community, the general public, who only wanted to use its difficulties and perseverance.
"We had heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan said recently in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Deputy Director Damon Davis, who is known for his most active activities among the prisoners sentenced to death.
The participation of Davis involved Ferrel in the project, together with six other locals, followed by events during the years after Brown was shot.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we talk," says the man.
"I had the most important thing about how local people are being made in a movie, because I'm going in the same way."
According to Folayan, the purpose was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, because it wanted to appear that the people "is not about the charismatic leader, but about the community".
The documents show that the private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as his/her death and his/her going, are surprising.
"I felt pretty naked", Ferrell talking about what it felt like to see for the first time.
"I understand that this work and the human representation of black people require a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's film once and brings back to the center the role of black queer women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Born in the home media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police had shot the black teenage son of Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three foundations of the movement are related to the scorer identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has kept up the whole movement," Ferrell says. "That's because we're always fighting on both sides.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "The movement is really run by black women, many of whom are queer women."
However, he stressed that Ferrelli had not been chosen for her "self-intended" applicant identity in the document.
"He's got the power," Folayan says.
"It is no coincidence that he was in the front line. Black queer women live in a lot of things, and they are a lot of trouble.
"The energy of the energy is passed on from the white fabric."
The new categories of description have already left Ferguson, but the gap between the commonwealth and the commonwealth is still tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole, and he was sentenced to block the engines in the demonstration.
His description of the social climate at home is brief and central: "The Confusion."
Still, he still has confidence in the slogan he was living outside of Ferguson's streets three years ago:
"Our goal is to fight for our rights.
Our duty is.
We must support and support each other.
We'll just lose the chain."
Appropriate uniformity: The artist creates patterns of Chelsea Manning's DNA.
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hung in the middle of the state of the art – white, black and brown faces, between which, at the most, you can observe the sameness.
These 30 works are the transformations made by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg based on the cheeks of Chelsea Manning and on the hair taken from the DNA samples.
Manning samples from Fort Leavenworth's prison where he delivered his 35-year sentence. Manning was called a secret from the release of classified diplomatic transmitters to the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Coming Recovery - an exhibition was opened on 2.8.2017.
Against this background there is two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg joins in his work the art, information technology and art. Manning is a transversal and professional translator whose sentence was reduced by Barack Obama on the second day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA by algorithmizing and creating 30 images based on his genetic data. They are sharp, though slightly theoretical, in terms of the modification of DNA data, multi-interpretation and the underlying causalities of the interpretations, as well as the identification.
Chelsea Manning, born in Bradley Edward, is an open match for women since the break-in. In 2013, she was found guilty of 20 cases, including in violation of the spy law, fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the prison condemned Manning: a rough, black-and-white selfie, where the troubled Manning sits in the car in the driver's seat. He has a floor light wig on his head, which became his symbol.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a great success in the Strange Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
That's what he created on the basis of criminal data. He received DNA information about, for example, tobacco smokes and gums, and created images of what people could have seen.
The artist received an e-mail from Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told us about a new exhibition at a press conference.
So why don't you contact Chelsea and ask him if he's interested in making Manning a DNA image of him?
The artist and his incarceration suddenly became friends of correspondence, and they worked together for a couple of years.
They even wrote together a book, which was published by Shoili Kanungo, which describes a future in which the President would have eased Chelsea's judgment and he would have come to see it.
In fact, Obama only shortened Manning's sentence once a day after a comic book publication, which was a lucky coincidence after seven years in a national military prison.
It also seems that the exhibition is being opened right now, as Donald Trump goes to his own country against informants and transgenders, and finds out that there are still new ways to strengthen the powerful doubts that I was supposed to alleviate in fact.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all have a purpose".
There is an artist's statement and under it the great roll-over by Manning, where the point of the family's i is called ". In its opinion, the artist asks for the end of "automatics and a contest based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
The opposite is the Manning DNA period: in lead it is long in letters C, G and A.
In this case, 200 letters — or nucleotide, as the artist’s scientific definition includes — together with Dewey-Hagborg, want to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal in our family and that information is very personal and open to interpretations," says Dewey-Hagborg. The exhibition will also feature the new 2007 edition of his Spororous Memories.
"DNA is telling countless stories. Here are 30 of them."
The last work of the exhibition is in its own room: page from the comic book of Manning and Dewey-Haggg.
The character of that manning rises from prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they get you quiet, they've won," the picture says.
"don't ever shut up."
"The text is a letter from Manning," says an artist from Philadelphia.
"It seems to me that I'm still living in a lot of colors."
As described in the comic book, Manning has not seen a woman yet. When Manning shows up, he greeted his own genetic data with a face like a crowd of protesters in the middle of the world.
It is purposeful, as everything else in this vision: for example, the Manning DNA period is written in lead pen for height, which is the same as his length (15.5 cm).
"The Chasvobs were at work earlier, but I wanted to bring them to the feeling of a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg says.
"I wanted to describe Chelsea's revolution, which was also behind his release."
The professor of the University of Northwestern and the professor of Oxford University are looking for a suspect in murder.
Asks about the opening of national searches to find the professor of Northwestern University and the staff of Oxford University, who are suspected to have stabbed a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook County Court documents show that on Monday the arrest warrants were issued from Wyndham Lathemi, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of being involved in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duringleau.
According to the documents, Cornell-Durnleau, 26, was killed after being stabbed several times.
According to the local information published by the Chicago Police Department, 27 July was found the body.
The police in the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim who had multiple incision wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Duranleu was found to be dead at the scene and the stab wound is being investigated as a murder.
Lathem has worked as Deputy Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Nortwester since 2007.
In an e-mail opinion sent by Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-Rector of the University’s Social Affairs, Lathem is now on the ground and has been granted access to the Centres of Northwestern University.
"This is a case in which the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University will assist in the investigation", Cubbage wrote.
Working as a parent financial assistant at Oxford University.
In an e-mail sent by the University and Somerville College informant, it is stated that "we have been in contact with police in the United Kingdom and we are here to help open the United States investigation teams in all possible ways."
The opinion stated that Warren's bodies were upset and hoped he would surrender.
The Chicago Police Commissioner Anthony Guglielki said that he calls on the suspects to make a serious dedication to the authorities.
"Police have an idea of their state, and we keep on making our search," Gugliel said.
According to Gugliel, the local, regional and local authorities are helping in the search for suspects.
He reported that he had received a call from the owner of the Grand Plaza building, who had given a clear indication that there was something going on in the year 1008.
The police described it as terrible at the scene.
According to Gugliel, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told the security cameras that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latha and the victim had an affair," Guglielek says.
The Grand Plaza Management Board informed the residents of the following information: "The process of change and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the right of domestic violence, should now be explored."
He threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London.
"I'm not anti-muslimi, I'm Catholic," he said to the police.
Moffatt must perform a 100-hour paid social service.
A 39-year-old man was sentenced to blow up an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims".
According to Independent magazine, David Moffatt was responsible for, among other things, gross harassment.
According to someone, the bookstore staff called you at home on the day of tomorrow.
According to the meeting, the man had "damaged the bookstore and killed the Muslims".
Suspect lost his business after a fight.
Moffatt was caught when he was on the phone for assaulting the police.
Swims were not related to bookstore events.
The authorities noted that Moffatt had been acting in the same way as the suspect in the book trade, said the police informant.
I'm not anti-Muslim, I'm Catholic, Moffatt told the police in interrogations.
In the form of a penalty, a man has to make a 100-hour pay social service and pay £620, i.e. approximately €690 legal expenses and 85 pounds, i.e. about €95 for victims.
According to Scotland Yard's informant, several hate crimes are not reported.
"We will take action in accordance with the WADA road map in the near future" – Prime Minister of Ukraine Vitaly Mötko, Prime Minister of Ukraine.
Prime Minister Vitaly Motko has said that Russia will shortly be taking over the road map of the World Anti-Doping Office WADA, which will be able to restore the RUSADA mandate of the Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
"Some of the measures on the road map have already been taken, and RUSADA was given the right to design and test in cooperation with UKAD, the United Kingdom Anti-Doping Commission.
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect", Muko stated on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which specifies the conditions for RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was published recently on the website of the organization.
According to that, it does not involve anything worrying about genome.
"It's all marked, and it's all done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and the WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the points of the road map requires that Russian anti-doping authorities publicly approve the results of the investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, as ordered by WADA. McLare investigates the state's alleged participation in the Polish sport doping.
Mutt said, "Research is because our anti-doping system has given up.
is.
There were no public programmes and we cannot mean something that did not exist.
Mutko said that there was a echo of the statement by Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Public Anti-Doping Commission of the Russian Federation.
On the same day, spoke to the Russian sportsmen in Rsport, Sminnov said that the Russian anti-doping institutions had a problem. "We have said several times that there are controversial positions and regulations in the report.
I do not wish to accept the proposal as a condition", he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to stop doping control in Russia in January 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, it was last month in a position to plan and coordinate testing under the control of international experts and KUAD.
WADA President Olivier Niggi visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After a visit, he said that the organization was on the right side of the road to regain its powers.
The British organization sceptically for Finns from loving learning: about the benefits of consumer packaging "not really".
The British community has doubts about the use of Finnish-style packaging.
Among other things, the BBC and Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, who is fighting against latent deaths, prohibits the production of their own brochures in the UK-shared authentic packages.
Distribution of pack of articles to all pregnant women in Scotland this month.
In England, the packaging and some parts of the packaging are to be found in England.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the package of milk prevents the risk of death from being hidden.
The unexplainable death of a child is the consequence of hand-to-hand death.
Lullaby Trust is an expert in health care in Britain in the area of child's life in the area of sleep.
We will no longer be able to pack our official brochures on them, because it would allow us to understand that we are avoiding this, information.
In Finland, there is one of the lowest group of infant mortality rates in the world, only two deaths per thousand births.
According to Luly Trust, most of the good news is due to a number of different reasons, such as a small number of teenage offences.
The fact that they give each family a box may be one factor.
However, you can't be sure that Lullaby Trust's CEO, Mr. Francine Bates, said.
We are concerned that dairy packaging is marketed as products that reduce child mortality and latent deaths.
The motherhood package is a Finnish invention and it has been given to all mothers in Finland for 80 years for free.
The package contains food such as children's clothing.
This year's packaging contains 53 products.
The fabric itself is a cardboard tool that can be put to sleep by a child.
According to the Scottish Government, the methodology it distributes meets all the security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes in bed.
According to Lullaby Trust, packing can be the best possible place to sleep, if there is no bed or bed available.
It is recommended that the packaging be packed only for daytime use and that it be discontinued as soon as the child is able to return.
The organisation also recommends to keep pets away from packaging and to ensure that it does not get wet or dirty.
The Vigke got away from another Japanese zoo in Japan.
The staff of a police zoo is looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has been surpriseing the staff as soon as possible and has escaped for the second two weeks.
Kilpikü fled the Shibukaka Garden in western England on Tuesday morning in Okayama.
Security cameras revealed that the municipality left the zoo via the main entrance.
It will not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned about the Yoshimi Yamane who works in the zoo.
Karannu 35-year-old cousin is a female, 55-kilometre long and about a metre long.
Yamane describes the fugitive as quiet and gentle.
In open spaces, the municipality is allowed to live freely in the garden area.
The field has not received any visual observations from the surveillance team.
The last voyage between Konna and the other one happened the other night.
Yamane found a way to find a fugitive along the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I mean, that's where I went to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can work faster than we can ever imagine.
These will help you to try to expect Uber to make mistakes.
Amy Allett wanted to measure employee satisfaction with her online trading startup, but the surveys didn't work.
They are likely to be vague, unprofitable or even misleading.
Thus, he assured them that some were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious of them.
"In fact, the questions were neither coherent nor objective," says Rühtt. Her hair care company, Madison Reed, focuses on the online shop. It has 75 employees.
So he decided to turn to help.
More and more new public administration start-ups have come into the market to find out how they can work.
They develop and combine software that can measure the binding of employees. They can make surveys and target them for certain teams and groups of the population, and provide an indeterminate reporting service and, in some cases, the top-end.
"My health may follow applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint-start in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint offers to help people with their analyses and work-related commitments.
This has been working on Glint's software for three years. He tells us that he has had a more in-depth view of the thoughts and knowledge of his work.
In addition, it can create a map of which you can see in one eye, where the workers are the most unsatisfying and who are the leaders of the weakest estimates, and which are the basis for which Kettt has been able to get to the bottom of the problem.
They have understood that they must follow the culture of employment so that they do not become the next Uber. Around the transport, they have lost sight of the former in a blog about a culture where workers are harassed and those who talk about problems are punished.
For start-ups like Glint, such neglect is an attractive business opportunity.
Government, regulation and compliance are a global industry, the value of which can rise to more than 111.7 billion by 2020 on the Let's Talk Payments website.
The Convercent in Denver is a start-up that will help companies to detect and prevent improper use. Interest in the company last year, when Uber's reputation experienced a crash.
The Convertent has almost 600 clients, such as Worldbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
That's the deal with Uber, too.
Like Glinin, Converten gives ways to make tailor-made surveys, collect answers in the same way as in real-time and identify problem areas.
Workers can make known the actual behaviour by sending an anonymous text message.
And if there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there are irregularities, the appeals will go directly to the government.
"The general opinion is the outlaws," says the founder and CEO of the Convercent, Patrick Quinlan.
It suggests that if an undertaking treats workers badly or acts in an unfair way, the consequences may be costly, even if they are not concerned. They may begin to boycott the company, and it may also lose the workers and become a trial.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant has over 25,000 employees at 500 points, and the next one is the Convertent for over a year, as it wants to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and are contacted directly to the headquarters.
In the past, if the worker wanted to report the problem, he had to first look at the phone number or email address that enabled him to make a notification to the headquarters, and then he had to make a selection and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often an intimidating and infrequent experience," says Judge James Vitrano of Ruby Tuesday.
In the past, problems have remained hidden from leaders working in another country or in the world, and now the problems of discrimination, harassment and unfair wages can be solved and dealt with in a way that is best done.
"I'm getting a more comprehensive and comprehensive idea about the reality of the employer," says Vitrano, who leads the Ruby Tuesday's supervisory team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from legal proceedings relating to employment."
According to Quinlan, companies tend to be more serious about ethics, values and the commitment of workers, when Arthur Andersen, a company that compared it with Enron-synda, as a result of his unethical activities, with Enron-syndaat.
The social media also understood that they could no longer prevent their dirty tool from public deliberations.
"Welcome to know before technology became an ethical control", says Quinlan.
Glint and Converten offer a copy of the website as a service to be used regularly.
It is a business model and an opportunity for venture investors, both Gint and Convercent, to provide support for their investors.
In the month of February, the Converence collected a total of 47.
Glint received a total of EUR 10 million from the Bestemer Venture Partners.
Investments are not surprising given the links between the companies, business and risk capital.
According to a number of studies, workers are looking forward to more jobs.
In competitions such as Laxo, wages are on the market, and interesting projects are just beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are being trained and valued and that they are making their job truly useful to a company.
"Workers will be more committed to success if they are comfortable with their lives and feel that they are being watched and that their work is rewarding", says the Director of LinkedIn Nina McQuee, who is responsible for remuneration and well-being.
Investors will be able to make a profit when they are in business, and companies will be successful when they are committed by the workers.
Half-analysing tools make it possible to strengthen the commitment of employees, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to the experts at the workplace, it is important that information about the commitment of workers is,
but it is useless; no action is taken on that basis.
If an undertaking requests feedback from employees, it can be considered as an example of change.
And if the change is not done quickly enough, or if it does not change at all, disappointment can affect the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand ways, you must be prepared to have four thousand discussions," says Kotter International Director General Russell Raath, who has seen companies trust too much to know.
"If the company does not take action, the workers will start to wonder if they would be heard.
and whether their opinions matter or not.
If the company does not care about them, where should they care about the company?"
According to this, Madison Reed is currently doing monthly human resources surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day as it is reported at Glint.
After collecting feedback from workers who were affected by the slowness of decision and the quality of communication, he was able to make changes to the teams and organise communication training to address the problem.
Mr. Ruby Tuesday understands his employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to ensure that staff are maintained in the long term in an industry known to be highly shifted by workers.
"If a company does not commit itself to creating a culture of transparency, it is workers," Vitrano says.
"If it fails employees, it will also require customers.
And without a customer there are no businesses."
In Sweden, 20-year-olds are suspected of concealing their naked neighbor, reports News Office TT.
The living in Gothenburg had gone home from the shower, while he was lying in his penthouse outside of his cell phone hanging from the head of the brain.
According to the woman, your cell phone set up your picture in the apartment.
The man who was upset about the case had run into another room to get drunk.
When he arrived to check the situation, the cell phone had been pulled up, but soon thereafter again.
A 20-year-old man who is a suspect in the shooting has admitted that he has taken a picture of him.
However, he claimed that he pictured only a common face.
The picture described on the cell phone was deleted and had not been able to prove it.
During the hearings, a man has committed an act, but has refused to commit a crime.
The man in his picture was right to think that he loved each other as "open mad".
According to U.S.A.T., you're charged with this case.
Producers call for more attention in the negotiations during the last round of negotiations.
The development of wages cannot be greater than, for example, the export industry, but the truth should be narrowed down," said OAJ President Olli Lukukinen on Thursday.
The temporary increase in public holiday payments highlights the difference, he notes.
We do not have the possibility to conclude agreements in which there would be no way to consider any cash involved.
Contracts in the municipal sector will only be concluded when the private sector paper is signed and the percentages of the increase are known.
Lukkainen predicts that, for example, OAJ's working conditions are late in January.
Percentage targets have not yet been revealed by Luke.
Mr. Luukka is also Chairman of the Public Education Consultation Organisation Juko.
Lukkainen: Cash cut increases the difference in earnings.
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts show that government sector wage and salary growth is falling, while public sector growth is increasing.
According to Luukka, the sixth cut in cash is another factor in the disparity of earnings.
it is clear how many pupils per teacher can be.
OAJ also points to the need to ensure that the equivalent of basic education is safe, sound and effective all the time.
According to the population, learning outcomes are getting worse, both between pupils and between regions.
It was a very long day for players when NCAA reduced daily exercises together.
It's almost 11 o'clock, and some UCLA American football players have stayed to talk about a new campus on the other side of the field.
Some of them have taken off their toy shirts, and their backs are shiny from the sweat to the training camp the first day after the scratching.
For many of the next ten minutes, this 10-minute chat support is midday break.
After three hours of training, players studying at the university's summer courses will move back to college for final exams. The next morning, they will arrive from all over the Wasserman World Centre.
"The next three days will be punishing these guys," Coach Jim Mora of Bruins will tell you again before Monday's changes on Tuesday.
The aim of the amendment was to reduce the number of daily workouts of players, but it has changed in their day – at least until the final final exams are to be carried out.
That is why the first three activities of the UCLA were nearly over seven months old, and the players were already trying to find a place for each of them.
This means that there are more training days in the last month than last year, and this is the third time in the course of the Westwood coach when the training is held at the same time as the summer course.
This is due to be done 18 times before the 20th of August, when the actual preparation for the opening match of the period begins: UCLA will be held at the University of Texas A&M in September.
Mora says that she has supported NRAA's change of rules, even though it has made players' schedules the most important.
"Our burden is really going on for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think we'll get better when we get anywhere, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes its operations from outside the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view from the training grounds to the adjacent parking area and Luskin Center, a quality hotel already bombed with a safety net that is already being used for running over the river.
Bruins players are supposed to move to hotels at night, but Mora acknowledges that problems can occur during the day when the rooms are available.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The point is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on the video from there. It is not too much.
The training description of the video is costing quite a lot of money.
But we have guards over there and in the parking lot.
We'll do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
Ignore the currently playing track
In the Central African Rwanda, the new presidential elections, the winner of which is already being seen, will be launched.
Paul Kagame is trying to re-establish his third period, but in reality he has been shifting from year to year.
The insurgent group, RPF, stopped the genocide of the extremes.
Kamame was the commander of the RPF.
The Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for the crushing of the world and for the restriction of the word of the word.
He has also been accused of misleading poverty statistics.
For the second period, Kagame will be able to move on because the truth has changed its laws in two seasons.
However, Ruada Kagame is also a genuine leader.
In the meantime, Rwanda has been subject to major reforms and international investments have flowed to the country.
In addition, Kagamme has played a major role in the unification of the continent of genocide.
Rwanda’s success has led many Africans to ask if the liberal multi-democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, Kagamme has also promised the nation more freedom after the earth has been raised to its feet.
All right, here we go.
Facebook fights against false news by improving the verification of facts.
Facebook intends to send possible false news to more and more independent fact-finders and present the results below the original article. The world’s largest network reported on this matter on Thursday.
The company’s website is an opinion that it will start to use updated machine learning for false news. Any false news will be sent to the inspectors of the facts and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the largest news publishers in the world. Many believe that false news will contribute to the end of the US presidential election in 2016.
The topic has risen to a political debate in Europe, where French voters were bombarded with fake news before the first presidential election and Germany, which is preparing for the debate, will support the social media networks to be fined if they do not quickly dispel the enemy.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the examination of facts is being conducted in the United States, the United States, the United States, the Netherlands and Germany.
"People want to see which films do not cross the screen of all employers. They also want to see more backgrounds so that they can decide more fully what they read and share", the head of the company Sara Sul in the log.
added that Facebook will test the related articles and make other changes to its contribution to making false news.
The comic book was born on: The story of a castle.
Now known as Squeeze Music Video, and as the hiding place of  quickly Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s, the Castle of Kisni Scotney in Kent County is known for its music film.
It has, however, been going on for over a thousand years now. Now this charming place in the river valley of Bewl is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a mobile-haired author of old documents.
"I find it hard to study a text written by a man who died more than six months ago," Rhodes knows perfectly.
"I know in person when I keep my letter in my hand."
The book Rhodes, A Castle in England, reports the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the EDVA. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, a promising British illustrator: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Britain May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, inspired by the documents of the UK.
"I came to tears in a letter with a copy of my thumb. The letter had been written to the splitters by a cooperative in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his fingerprints!
The letters smell like mists, because then there was fire as an illustration.
The smell of the century later makes the speaker feel that he is on the spot himself.
The archives!"
A writer who was attracted to old documents was allowed to live in a castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not soon be in prison for a little longer than would have been desired.
He spent days studying the Victorian "new" castle, treasures, treasures, and treasures, such as those hanged on the walls and those of the centuries in custody.
He toured the ruins of the old castle and the farms and talked to forest guards, gardeners, and, more often, even the artists who pictured the book.
At night, he "got a whisky and started writing".
The closer history of Contney is never known, since the ship was transferred to the National Trust Foundation in its entirety only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussein, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff of the Foundation was just about to open a review. Rhodes describes that the archives had been received for hundreds of years at the same time: by taking all the extra information to the conference.
There were books in the archives, letters from the English Empire, and maps of who knew something. "You can imagine that land disputes are boring," Rhodes says. "However, this is where the books fight for even one of them.
I was just thinking, "I think you should give me a break."
Some of the stories are going from castle to world history, such as The Labourer. It tells of a man that will be involved shortly after the completion of the castle, in the peasant rebellion in 13 8:
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex says that there was a riot in the castle in 1380", Rhodes says.
"The English peasant uprising began in the same area, and it came to mind that the uprising could be a riot.
Is there any connection between these events?"
The other books of the book are closely related to the history of the castle — like The Priest, the story of the priest that Darrell's family measured for seven years in the course of his evangelization.
He Smugler, on the other hand, tells the story of smuggler Arthur Darrell of the 17th century. He is said to have staged his own funeral by filling his coffin with a stone (it was noticed a few years later when his graves were opened).
Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family in Scotney. "Family men have been a lot of freaks. They kept coming to debt and buying things that they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family would solve their problems by marrying wealthy old women. I see them as good-looking friends who knew how to fling the heirs."
Rhodes is now applying for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about the Life Underworld, an improvement in the early 1900s, which is still only a eutrophic property.
There's a perfect place on the beach of Contney in her heart.
"It was sad to get out of there," he says.
"I wouldn't have had much to do with this hell's life."
Breakout of the worst form of life.
The military alliance between NATO and Russia has clearly deteriorated, comments NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Thursday.
Stalten was responsible for the situation in Ukraine and its role in the conflict in Ukraine.
I can imagine that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the Cold War, Stoltenberg said in the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we would strive to work closely with Moldova.
In particular, since the introduction of the crime in 2014 and the unusual instability of Russia in the eastern region, NATO's relationship with the situation has been seriously deteriorated.
Still, according to Staltenberg, NATO is still committed to doing so so that the voltages do not get tighter in the world.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in dialogue with the Russians in order to ensure that we are back down and that we are in a fresh world.
Comments by Staltenberg from the United States President Donald Trump points to a dangerously poor level between the United States and the US.

Vladimir Klishko quits - a new game of Anthony Joshua will not come true against Anthony Joshua.
The long-lasting world of professional boxing in the third world, Vladimir Klichko, quits his career.
Ukrainian Klichko, 41, informed of its decision on Thursday morning.
At the Olympics in the Atlant, Klichko fought nine times to win the 64th game.
He held various MMs for years 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klichko lost his career in the last two fights.
Tyson hit the spot in January 2015.
In July of this year, Klishko met Anthony Joshua at the Wemble Stadium and, after a massive fight, lost his mind at the 11th at the last.
Joshua and Klichko were expected to meet at the re-enactment in Las Vegas in January.
However, Klicko does not seem to be motivating the poppy.
I was going to take a few weeks to make a decision to give me enough space for the Wembley match, Klishko told me when he informed me.
I've done everything I've ever dreamed of, and now I want to pursue another career after sport.
I could never have imagined that I would have such a long and incredibly successful boxing career.
I am very grateful for that.
See Klitshkon’s arguments on the basis of a decision on the basis of which it is based.
Klitsko's manager Bernd Bölte informed me when he announced that the decision to close was the Klitskole.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to finish if he does not have enough motivation anymore.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Bétte stated.
Klishko has been dating US actor Hayden Panttier since 2009.
The couple has one child, the daughter of Kaya, born in 2014.
Klitsko's big brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world.
In 2008 the brothers controlled the M-tissues of different alliances at the same time.
The weather operator of Finland is under the conditions: "Get out of the file".
Sleigh jumper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer’s out-of-life period.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with problems.
The wind and the heat have taken her from the file.
Even in the London World Cup there are unstable conditions.
Minna Nikkinen.
The conditions are now this summer against the archer Minna Nikik.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I didn't even get the little sails to move properly," said Nikkan after the Instruck race.
I've been doing business here knowing how many times I've never been to this place before, and I've been to Paavo Nurmin Games.
In this period, it has been really hard to keep up with such unstable winds in the exercise," said Nikkanen in the Kaleva Games.
He was talking on Thursdays in London, too.
The challenge has been to get the technique together - whether it's frozen or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been taken from the file.
It makes no sense to consume energy under the conditions of the circumstances.
He got into his hall jump 455 thanks to the World Championships.
There's been 4 out there.
The situation in London is not the same for all of us.
There's got to be a temper and a better wind waiting.
This is going to be over the top 460 in the mid-term.
Is there any other way to train abroad?
That won't be necessary.
Last summer, I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning of the year.
I got the jump together and the technology settled.
I should have done the same thing now.
It's normal for you to get your hands on the hall, now you've got your head on.
Would you like to have some fun?
25 °C warm.
A lot of wind goes on, as long as it's constant.
Experienced ex-officer pushed politicians up above: "There is no division now or for more than one year".
Despite a poor financial climate, the Government of Juha Sipilä must retain its hat and ensure that the state budget is increased by cash, by means of budget estimates for decades, prepared by Erkki Virtanen.
According to him, there is no reserve.
Yle challenged in 2015 a live stream from the mid-week Singles Power.
The construction of this country's next year's budget is about to start.
The recent policy proposals that have been put forward by politicians, such as the guarantee of a raise in pension, the reduction of car tax and the support of electric bicycles, Virtanen, are of the opinion that this is a debate.
In the first place, they tell us that the elections are starting to be close, because when ten percent of the budget is financed by an additional debt, we have nothing to split now or for many years.
It is even a trick to talk about the distribution, when you take it, Virtanen told Yle about it.
I stressed that all debt is due from the person concerned.
The post is a long part of the preparation of the state budget: he started in the financial ministry in 1978 as Secretary-General of the General Budgets and then as Deputy Head of the Section and Head of Director.
Before his last retirement, he served as Secretary-General of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
In Yle's interview, the current trend in GDP is likely to be temporary.
All the fortunes estimate that this is the peak that will be going on next year to the under five, and Finland is looking forward to an increase of one per cent over the next ten years.
Washington will change the rules for a permanent residence permit.
According to the media, Mr. Donald Trump informed that the Green Card rules will be amended by a new asylum plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, tighten the requirements of temporary work permits and provide for family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republican Republic and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by other means of granting permanent residence permits to people in other countries.
It also reduces back-migration and replaces the current one.
The new application process will benefit those who know how and are able to support themselves and who have the most useful skills in our house", according to the media, Trump announced.
The Danish queen's wife doesn't want to be desecrated with the queen in the same place.
Ms. Henrik does not want to come to the funeral with Queen Margareta.
In the picture of Prince Henry and Queen Margare, pictured in April.
Queen of Denmark Margareta, 77, and her spouse, Prince Henry, 83, is not buried side by side, says the Danish court.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House has today announced that Prince Henrik would not like to be buried in the Roskilde Court of Justice, the court will inform you on Thursday.
According to the BT paper, the reason for this is the prince's dissatisfaction in his role as a star in the family.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and title in the Danish monarchy, the head of the court, Lene Belleby commented.
The decision of the prince not to bury him next to the queen is a result of not being treated equally with his wife.
According to the Court, the queen has been aware of the desire and understanding of her husband’s place of birth and the decision of her husband.
On the radio: the car had to come on the highway.
Toms were accompanied by a common wife and two small children.
They were not injured in an accident, but they will not receive any money from the insurance if the other party is not sought.
The accident occurred at the Keimola Gate in Vantaa.
Archive image of the construction plant of Hall III.
The Vantaa Tommi tells us that his family survived a car accident on Tuesday.
Tommi, his common-law wife, Riina, and the couple's two little cars drove on the highway at Keimolan Gate in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
Based on the III connection to the Hämeenlinlinnväylä, you drove along the speeding distance of the completed car, which was to drive the car to the side, Tommi says.
The shelter movement of the car would have come on top of Tom.
I braked and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
I'm going to drive the car to the side of the road, and it's going fast.
The parents and the two little children in the backseat did not hurt.
One child is under 3 years of age, the other under 1 year of age.
It's pretty good luck when we didn't do anything.
The passers-by didn't even drive right on the road, even though there was a lot of traffic in the area.
There was an accident about 5.20 a.m.
To be honest, no one came to them, and the home called the emergency room.
They came out of the car by force.
The ambulance and rescue personnel came in, and the condition was checked.
The car went to the redemption facility.
Tom talks about him and his wife having little income, and they got a chance to help buy a car two years ago.
The second family does not, of course, receive any money from the guarantee.
He wants witnesses to hit him in the car, and he wants to drive him to the driveway.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to take the kids to the yard and go thank you, Tom says.
Tommi saw that the car was open, the old car.
It was likely from the late 1990s or the early 21st century.
He felt that the beginning of the license plate number was SIG.
If we don't get the blame, I don't know how to do it economically, we're going to have to do every cent right now.
Tommi hopes that what has happened or something about it will be in contact with the state of affairs.
The police station in eastern New York and the rescue facility in Central New York confirm that they have had a duty on Tuesday evening at the scene of the accident.
Head and story changed at 21.15: In the case of the beginning, the other car did not come to the welcome lane, but was to drive from the pace of the family to the front of the family.
Lotta Jäppinen's presentation deals with human relations by means of a sense of humor - The Self-Detector will see you at What? at both and the second stage of the theatre.
Lotta Joppinen, from Kouba, brings first-time guidance to What?
The self-reporter is a musical show about past human conditions and inadequateness.
Director Lotta Jäppinen says you're welcome.
The subject will be dealt with by a human being.
Bad feelings don't end up in debt, he says.
According to Jäppinen, the round summer show has been created with a long-range budget and a large, wide heart.
The name of the show will make you wonder what will make you aware when you meet a new person.
Do you think he's got something going on, or is he going to have another coat of wood?
The infallible presentation mixes with fact and fiction.
The icy has both led and dramatized the document.
He's also responsible for the lights.
The draft agenda has been drawn up on the text of the working group and there is no agenda.
The director believes that even if a presentation of the thoughts of the whole economy is presented, it speaks all the time.
Mr. Jäppinen points out that the Self-Detector does not actually tell you about his or her own or his personal relationships.
Fact and fiction blend together.
My own values will certainly be passed on to you.
I do not mean that relationships would be bad, but I do not mean that relationships, especially relationships, would be a prerequisite.
A lot of lessons from divorced fathers.
Jäppinen believes that the Self-Detector draws a current picture of young adults living in Finland in 100 years of age.
Because many people have learned a lot about their relationship with parents, many of whom are different.
At least it means that we have to move on.
You don't need to stay in a relationship.
The performance is performed by Minea Lkng, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes Mr. Ella Snellman, President-in-Office.
The music is made up of Jäppinen and Rokan.
The love of the house was set on fire in Kouvola.
Lotta Jäppinen, 26, from Kouvola, is studying for the guidance of the theatre-freedom in the University of Applied Sciences of Turku.
There's two years behind him, and there's another way to go.
The cold start of the theatre has begun during the Kouvolan years.
The high level of the music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has been acting, among other things, at the University Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Institute in Turku.
The guidance has become more and more interesting.
The self-reporter first got his first night on Narri's screen in Helsinki last year.
In the future, about 45 minutes of the presentation was also seen in the Jäppinen city of study in the market.
Self-reporter Kouvolan What? at 4.8.19 and 5.8.14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic Winner has come to an end for a year from the terrible motocrossnetivity - the neck fractured.
The few athletes in Finland have the same ultimate natural force as Janne Lahtela.
For twenty years each day, the ace of each of the two figures went around the world for hundreds of days a year, chasing his dream of the Olympics.
The dream developed in 2002, but Lahtela moved on.
He was not only an tireless practitioner, but also an experimenter of the colors.
There are probably not many forms of exercise on Earth that the chemist would not have tried again.
It's been a pleasure to practice.
There's always something new, Lahela tells us.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahtela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela became a motivocross accident.
As a result, his carotids and both hands broke.
I wasn't doing anything right.
I was working on the wounds in my home for a year," says Lahtela.
The bay was bad luck.
It also shows that age may have been a part of it.
Driving around can sound crazy.
But I didn't ask for limits.
It's just so loud that you don't have a 40-year-old!
After the accident, the Gulf went into a special situation.
The hour-to-day rush came to a halt like nothing.
He was a long-time leader of the Japanese free country team.
Lahela began to wash immediately after the end of his own career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15 years old, I happened to be in my position.
I didn't really mean much, Lahtela tells me.
In modern times, even the Gulf often challenged its protection in the slopes and in physics tests.
Surprisingly, it was a good idea to change.
Originally and spiritually, they were so angry that they didn't seem to have any sense of their own.
Not even with him.
You're good to be there, too.
I'm actually playing it, 'cause for once in a while, it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just... it's just...
The forced break inspired Lahtelan to become Finland’s Chief Manager.
She's afraid she'll be burned to the end.
The body is more likely to find places that have gone down than they have.
I didn't realize I had to rest so much.
Lahtela started as a coach for the Finnish freecountry team in the year before.
At the same time, he found the best hobby to replace the mercenaries.
Otherwise, motocrosses to frisbegegolf.
I'll be right out of the bat right away.
At least I was in the mood for seven hours.
The bay has always been a super-quick trainer himself; he does not require his training to be the same as him.
I don't want to make all the same stuff happen.
In our culture, it is time to be a natural person and a way to become the world's best.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been in line with it, says Lahtela.
The sexbots come and we have reason to be upset.
It is here: a report on technological progress in the field of sex robotics – as soon as it has started to feel that 2017 can no longer change any more.
Yeah.
The sex robots are big now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) has conducted a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
"We must start to take seriously the generalisation of sex robots," says Foundation founding member and professor of robotics and artificial intelligence embezzlement at Noel Sharkey Shefý University.
Customers can choose the type of dark-eyed color, the shape of the nipples and the type of fingernails.
"Sex robots are being skid on, but they are already moving quite a lot, and we will see more of them," Sharkey said at a publicity conference.
The sexes have evolved from inflatable dolls to robots with a feeling of silicone skin as well as the characteristics created by it, which resemble human behaviour.
The user can also adjust to his or her own preferences always in view of the colour of the nipple shape and fingernails and colors.
All the more important, the robots have a "personality" that makes the Stepfords look like an advanced freedom fighter.
Sexes have developed into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the characteristics of RealBotix Robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, perhaps shyness.
The Roxxy Gold robots of the True Companion have been premeditated by a variety: Fradig Farrah seems shy, Wild Wendy is interesting and so on.
"The personality of Roxxy Gold is best adapted to the personality of the user", advertised on the company's website.
In other words, the robot likes the same thing as the operator.
There are also many moods:
It can be, for example, a comet, a talk or a "in a mood".
There are many worrying features of the widespread spread of sex robots: they replace genuine relationships, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape fantasies, as the user, for example, stands out as a shy and resistant robot.
The real Companion is a comparison of the Roxxxy robot to the vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators. Why wouldn't a man have sex robot?"
However, sexbots are not just a fetist or a new sex toy.
In our darker and deeper culture, we are told that we are talking about equality between men and women.
A large proportion of men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the FRR report described their increased popularity.
However, magnetic phenomena mean much time for life.
And many will be moved seriously or opposed only if the market allows it.
It is no coincidence that sex robots have begun to become generalized at the same time as women's rights are threatened around the world and the President sits in the House, who has dared to harass people.
The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattaresi) is not the most worrying image of its strong language, for example, the images of a hanged body and the eye dug out.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems that there is a surprising distance.
It is necessary to make the sex robots as much as is technically possible for real women (in proportion to the size of the porn stars).
The developers of robots make their skin feel real and their movements require as much human movement as possible.
However, their "personalities" are a part of reality.
The Polish cannot leave the relationship or the relationship.
They have neither their own will nor their own history – nothing referring to independence or imaginative of mere submission.
They are pleasant servants.
Orchids.
There is a doubt that two acts of terrorism were planned in Australia, a group led by Isisi's head.
The head of the board of directors was the team of British men, who is suspected to be taken to the office of Etihad Airways, which was about to take the bomb to the site of the Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, the person in the father's leading character had also sent to Sydney the building blocks of the bomb.
Suspects that the bomb was supposed to be taken to the gun on 15 July, but the attempt was interrupted before the security check.
The police will not tell us more why the attempt has been interrupted.
It was the practice of existing suspects to build a non-toxic gas-distinguishing device and to take the device to its accuracy in public places, for example, in a public device.
Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan of the Republic of Australia says that the theory was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
On the basis of suspected misbehaviours, four men were killed in police raids last night.
One of the men has been released, but his interrogations are also under way.
The second half of the second half?
You get what Romney seems to be the heirloom of common sense.
For the past few years, it has already been noted that the dissent of voters has also contributed to the families.
At the time of Christmas and this afternoon, the consultative panels of the American newspapers instructed how to deal with family members who voted for Trumpic.
We all want to break our information bubble.
I'm not sure you've got enough of Trump's family left behind.
I'm telling you this because my cousin was visiting me this month in New York, and he's a left-wing poet who's long been working against our family Republicans.
It was a reminder that the common enemy can have a joint influence.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousins, including the Republicans, are suddenly and suddenly on the same side, with whom he has been arguing for decades.
At the table, it's a good thing, but more generally, it involves important risks.
Trump has given the left a new stream, but the deceiving effect of his presidency can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about Trumme and "normalisation", we talk about the avoidable possibility that one day we will never again be able to loathe his tricks.
In the future, there is an even more horrifying possibility that Trump will normalise the right border Republicans, which, compared to Trump, seem to be all the more rational.
I look back on Mitt Romene's crazy version of madness: car out there, 14% income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns).
After the Trumpic period is over, the next presidential candidate for the Republic needs to be only sober, and it seems like an immediate improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our child to the centre park carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best thing New York gets for three dollars without caffeine.
Karl’s horses are vast, the characters in the middle – the horrid clowns and the animals looking back on the horror – are vicious, and the music behind the background is a very fascinating music.
Many of the features of New York become disappointing over time: the prospects of large buildings are getting tired, the city silhouettes become too familiar and the reality of the world does not match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I am completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage but a large transport circle in North London. Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-life pub, but it is not counted.
On the other hand, the centre of the park is still the least magical experience — even so much so that two two-year-olds, one-twelfth and two-twelfth-twelfth-year-old women make a huge contribution to this.
I would have given carousel a full score if anyone had asked my review, but luckily no one would have asked questions.
On the other hand, I was asked in the department to estimate my "payment experience" on a scale of five to five stars before, in other words, my credit card to a reading institution.
The same thing with my coffee in my corner, but I'll also give you an opportunity to make an estimate of 15% of the money when I go to the coffee shop myself.
This everyday interaction is slowed down and pressures the client to put his person into a game where it is not necessary.
The vendor of the store was upset when I gave my card a five-star experience.
Shefki Kuzi got fired from Inter - "I had no real faith".
FF Inter has thanked Hefki Kuzi's Society for the task of coaching the representative team.
The approval obligation shall be taken by Fabrizio Pácsre, former assistant coach.
The training team will continue in its current work.
A foreign Påreta has worked as an assistant coach in former U.S. Sunderland, among other things.
In January, the 51-year-old Pácsreta, who joined the Interin training program, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, President of the FC Inter Presidency, was sorry about what happened.
It is never easy or pleasant to change the currency.
Hefki Kuq, however, had no longer been able to come to terms with the company, and that was not the case at the moment, Håkans commented on the report.
The Piccareta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He and another coaching team are already responsible for tomorrow's HIFK in the morning.
The evening news of the team has died all over Thursdays.
Kuqi told the players Thursday morning that my assistants, Piccret and John Allen, are away.
Kui and Pikkareta took a strong stand in the Inter game against P Kes last night.
Linda Lampenius published a youthful picture of the 1980s - would you identify a serious violin student?
violinist Linda Lampenius's new new youth picture.
There are several images in the image, which lets you conclude that there is a zombie in the picture with 16-year-old Sibelius-Akatemian.
Lampenius himself also wonders seriously about the young woman looking at the camera.
A short time ago, serious, he's not texting me.
If the picture is not shown, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published images of his past and also a reference to painful topics.
A year ago, he was working together on the picture.
In the second picture he is seen 20 years ago, the second he poses now, as a mother of two.
In his picture, Lampenius was thinking about his own growth as a person and refers to eating disorders, such as those of which he suffered when he was younger.
He 20 years ago and thank you...
I still look much like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is I've learned how I like myself and how I look, Lampenius.
After that, he had added hashtags to English for life, eating disorder, uncertainty, self-confidence, self-esteem, living, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, old age is cool.
Lampenius has openly spoken about the food shortages in the past.
He was in the house when he was 14 years old for anorta and anorta.
A little bit later, he also fell into his clumsy, which was finally revealed in the year 6.
Getting better was starting to get better.
In addition to therapy and association, Lampenius is a new one.
The branch was sent from prison to hospital because of chest pain.
This is the second time that the Bishop was taken from hell to the hospital.
Last year, he was hospitalized for cuts on his wrists, which, according to the authorities, he fell in a cell.
The investigating officer was convicted of the murder of the prosecutors after the original execution of the conviction.
He killed in the early days of the Second World War in 2013 by shooting a number of shots through the door of the Bible to live in the Pretoria.
The heist alleged that his country was supposed to be a night-time intruder who was hiding in the WC.
The prosecutors have stated that they intend to appeal again, because they consider the three-year judgment of the Bishop to be too mild.
The D.A. intends to appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the complaint will possibly be dealt with this year.
If so, the judgment of the Bishop may extend for 15 years.
Death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
A human being was considered to have been involved in an illegal camp in Greece.
The twice camped Bulgarian was arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
A number of unauthorised encamped people were held in Sithonia on the morning of August 1st. There were two Bulgarians among the campers.
They were taken over the same day, but the case will be investigated.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later released the Bulgarians.
they have tightened up the rules on the free camp areas and already provide significant fines for all those who are encamping in areas more than intended to be set aside.
Decisions until end of end of period.
The Ministry would point out that the right to impose a fine may be subject to the imposition of a fine.

Red meat, milk products and chocolate may lighten the irritant bowel necessitator.
Red meat and chocolate may sound like gastrointestinal nightmares.
However, the recent study suggests the opposite: a high degree of meat protein and milk products may facilitate irritant bowel disease.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an impervious disease, with around 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom, causing stomach cramps, swelling, repeated or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
However, researchers at the Washington University found that the necessary amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body to obtain immune cells that strengthen its tolerance.
According to Director Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the intestines and ensure that harmful microbials in food do not enter the body.
The cells that cause the causes of the causes are balanced cells that reinforce the resilience, which protect the body without harming the weak tissues.
If the balance is too close to inflammation, it may result in an irritant bowel disorder.
The tests found that resistant immune cells have been found to be present in mice with certain bacteria in their intestines.
The bacteria in question need tryptophan to get the immune cells started. Tryptophan is one of the ingredients of the proteins.
"We found a connection between the development of Lactobacillus reuter and the development of tolerant cells. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal intestinal microbiomy," says Professor Colonna.
"The more Tryptophan was involved in mouse consumption, the more of them were all immune cells."
If the same works for humans, the combination of Lactobacillus reuter and the combination of most tryptophans can strengthen the intolerance of the intestine and enhance the sensitivity of the infection.
In the study of resistant immune cells, researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan found that although one group of mice had anti-cellular cells, they were not in the same mouse mice that were kept separate from the other group.
He suspected that there was a difference between mice and gastrointestinal microbials, i.e. gastrointestinal normal bacteria, fungi and viruses in the community.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was tested, four bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells but not in mice.
When Lactobacillus reuter bacteria were given to sterilely-bred mice who did not produce list of microbes and who did not develop immune cells, they developed immune cells.
The researchers wanted to find out how the bacteria affect the immune system. They increased Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in the fluid and transferred some of the resources — without bacteria — from the mouse to the inaccuracies that were isolated from the mouse into the immature immune cells.
The immune cells developed into strong cells.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indole lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophans in the mouse diet, the number of tolerance-enhancings rose by about 50%. When the count of tryptophans was estimated, the figure was half of the previous.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same resilience-enhancing cells as any, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the site of tryptophan from the Lactobacillus reuter bacteria can cause the cells to function in humans the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable intestinal syndrome.
"We probably want to contribute to the development of these cells, because they regulate the inflammation of the intestines in the inner surface," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"high tryptophan levels combined with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their increase."
According to Jose Murinho, in line with his "neron", he got a deal with Nemanja Mati in the first place.
Jose Mourinho believes that the United States got in line with the "neon" following the agreement with Nemanja Mathi. In the mid-term gamer debuted Manchester in the ranked match against Zambia on Wednesday afternoons.
In the second round of the match before the UEFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid on Tuesday, he was the protagonist against Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira. He played a protagonist against the game of Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Mati was not yet in good condition because she was not involved in the tour of the Asia of blue shirts, the beginning of the day. She was only able to get on the field for 45 minutes – according to Morinho, it is time to change before the start of the elective day.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking makes him a genius – he has a natural thinking ability in the world," says Mourinho.
"We'll help him be ready as soon as possible before he does."
In addition to Mati, the arrivals of Victor Lindelof and the Round Chapter were also starting a game at the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho was about to start his start-up session for the start of the period.
The Independent this year revealed that Moorinho will be another three new players, even though he has already done a "best job" by getting three of his four players first appointed by him.
"The three of the four – must give thanks to the others," you said.
"I'm happier if I can have all four, but they did an excellent job."
Soils bulldozered Germany for two days.
The Finnish World Cup team lost its fourth World Cup tournament to Germany directly from 0-3 (23225, 23-25, 14-25).
German routine playing is high.
Even their game was in every sector, Finland’s Chief Manager, Tapio Kangasniemi, told me when he announced his announcement.
In the first two sessions, Finland kept its opponents under pressure, but in the second, Germany was considerably stronger.
Germany leads the field.
When we were playing hard enough aggressively and in certain places, we were able to go to the kitchen," Kangasniemi said.
Finland had scored 14 points for Pia Korhonen.
Three of the four lost points to Slovenia.
Reuters: A large jury has already sent challenges for Trump Jr's Russia meeting.
The United States General Court has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr and the Advocate General Natalia Veselnitskaya.
The great jury convened by attorney Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr and the Chief Advocate General Natalia Veselnitskaya, known for the Kreml connections.
This is the report of the news agency Reuters, which, at the same time, confirms the publication of the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday, announced the announcement of the general meeting of the General Court.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges to a meeting of Mr Trump Jr and Mr. Kremme, a well-known Veseljutszer, which will take place during the US Presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump Sr's then campaign manager Paul Manafort and his sons-in-law Jared Kushner, the current adviser to the Home House.
According to Reuters' sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington reports a build-up of the state of the Russian investigation.
The sources add that Muitter wanted a large jury to help with the investigation, which is trying to find out how to get involved in the US presidential elections and whether Trumbi is working or working with him on the subject.
The jury extends the possibilities of Mueller, presents challenges and forces people to testify on a voluntary basis.
There are a number of common people who work behind the doors of houses.
The General Assembly shall consider the methods to be determined by the D.A.'s investigation and decide whether the case should be brought to justice.
A smart inventor microchiped himself to get home and into a car with his hand on the swing.
A smart inventor is the first in the whole country to microchip himself so that he can open his home to the outside door, get into his office and start his car with a swing of his hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and the front finger of Steven Northam, a 33-year-old, who now provides services to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier by using the Northami BioTeq technology.
Balam cooperates with Geoff Watson, an adjudicator at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hans, in order to determine the specifications for the installation of the microchip.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 minutes to complete.
The Northami company also changes the locks of houses and cars to match the microchip. One lock will cost 300 pounds to handle one lock.
Northam is married and has one child, and he has installed the microchip technology in both his home and his BMW Z4 car, which will stop when he drops his hand on the wheel.
In the House's exhibition, there are thousands of dollars for taxpayers.
Last year's decision to fly a mermaid to the North West of the Home for the event of production of the United States came to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The name of the White Sikorsky VH-3D Helicopter is Marine One, when the President is on its way. It was an appeal at the event in the Führy House on 17 July, in which the American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a large number of US officials from all 50 states took a look at the products.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, there was a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a player from Mississip, among other things.
The House's military office had only requested a positioning order about 36 hours before its landing to the south lawn for the "extraordinary" event, which is reflected in the documents of the Navy HMX-1 Helicopter Beam.
"I only want to make sure that you are aware of this matter because it is an exceptional event, which gives you lots of attention to the situation", the HMX1 account of the agreement that takes place on the last day of the email.
The message said that a copy would arrive at the southern lawn at the morning of 17th of July and that the event would start at three afternoons. A helicopter would only leave the place if the lawn was removed between 4 and 9 a.m.
It was noted in the communication that if I was to leave the North House late, it would be necessary to have another crew of service hours due to restrictions.
The original crew was on hold for the time being, and one of the security personnel was on board when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documentation received by the TIME magazine whether another crew was needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes.
According to the documents, the HMX-1 intelligence, a violation of the transaction law, is a violation of the law.
"One thing about us was whether there was a Hatch Act here, and we were told that there was no breach," second paragraph.
"It sounds like you can participate," the assistant commander replied.
Made in America was the event of the First House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
There's more to it than the official one.
The President then spoke in favour of the reform of the university, which had been carried out at the event, as well as of sound public regulation.
The use of the Marine One Helicopter and Air Force One is not subject to a new policy definition.
They must be used on their journeys,
their use is unusual only for photographs.
Trump's actions attracted attention in the course of the course when Air Force One was behind the president's campaign in the state of Florida in Melbourne. Trump has criticised the use of the popular idea of his people.
"The White House is very pleased with the Made in America event, which featured products from all 50 states produced by the Americans of American materials," noted Secretary-General Lindsay Walters of the House of the Black House.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct training flights in the Washington area and operate in the south of the lawn from the introduction of the beam to the Black House to the nearest centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of January, HMX-1 made 58 workouts for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of a monthly education conference.
One of them also fought that day for 11 hours in "non-péllicile support".
According to the House of Directors, the event did not entail any other costs for taxpayers.
The informant told me that the company was not involved in organising a presentation of the helicopters in the south of the House of the Commons in the grass.
HMX-1 does not have a record of flights related to the President's duties, and an accurate assessment of the costs of the event is difficult.
According to the Ministry of Defence for the year 2017, the exchange rate of VH-3D is 24 380 per hour.
According to HMX1 units, flights from Lantico’s base in the Republic of Virginia to the White House and back lasted the whole hour.
According to the House of Directors, the cost of using the helicopters is clearly lower than the cost of operating the helicopters.
"The calculation of the costs to the payers according to the level of compensation is misleading," says Walters.
"The estimated equivalent includes staff, maintenance and many other so-called "individual costs, to be taken into account in the estimated appropriations."
According to a survey carried out by the study company in 2015, the level of compensation does not include the cost of employment, but it takes into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, the former Secretary-General of the General House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter during the event.
"The idea is to use American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the World of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and working through it probably hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that in most Americans, we are proud of the tools and other defences that many Americans have worked for.
It is entirely appropriate to make a point."
It is not certain whether Trump will go to the next stop during the event, but at least he stopped by the fire truck driver's office.
In the middle of the house Trump was making fun of the press for his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said. "I have three."

The Venezuelan State Attorney asks for the right to prevent the appointment of a new government in the country.
The Venezuelan State Attorney has requested a court order to prevent the appointment of a new government in the country from being appointed.
The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, has announced that the settlement that was adopted last month is intended to be named again.
In a controversial discussion, the country was chosen by a locality, which may, among other things, change the world's world.
According to Advocate General Luisa Ortega, the decision to reject has been requested on the grounds of doubt of pediatricism.
Ortega has also started to vote for a chemistry study.
He appointed two judges after the United Kingdom, which organised the representative's vote, said that the results had been manipulated.
According to each of them, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was as much as the number of actual voters.
Only the Allies of Maduro were eligible for the representative list, and the number of 54 members of the delegation is, among other things, the son and wife of Maduro.
In addition to the amendment of the Constitution, the settlement can defuse the opposition led by the opposition and change the laws.
Madroua described as the numerator.
Maduro's actions are largely condemned.
The Opposition considers the Constitution to be the way Maduro can define its position as a way of amending its position.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Madro and called this a dictator.
For its part, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have announced that they do not recognise a new mission.
Madro claims that the new settlement is the key to the country's political and economic crisis.
In Venezuela, restlessness has been going on for months.
There's a lot of people injured in them, and there's more than a hundred.
In the context of the economic crisis, theozula fell from the price of oil to the price of oil.

The Opposition is also expected to support the opinion on the date when the new mandate is to begin.
The Finnish address was charged with 4 years in the United States of America.
On Thursday, the United States of America, the United States of America, sentenced Maxim Senah, who was 41 years old, to almost four years in prison for being part of a worldwide computer fraud.
It was held in Finland in August 2015 as a result of the United States' demand.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
He was kept by the Finnish border when he was returning home by the time he was returned home.
In January 2016, Finland handed over the United States of Senah to the courts against objections, reports AFP.
In September of this year, he was involved in computer fraud, which had resulted in the benefits of many things.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the Minister of Justice, the Sánah will be deported from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Foreign Ministry strongly provoked Finland after the arrest and said that it should not be given to the United States.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were accused of being arrested in Finland without having to discuss the matter with you.
According to the author, Senah was a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
With the help of the virus, fish users' names and passwords.
The fraudsters then continued to use the information on the Internet, which enabled them to make spottles and to spread mail.
According to the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Justice, see President Kenneth, the case shows that the United States is also seeking other active cyber criminals.
We have a desire and a desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us when he was informed.

Narcos's second season trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of character, so Cali's card is going to hit the main part of Netflix's hit series.
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered during the second production period of Narcos, the Netflix game is not yet over.
The direct debit service has already confirmed that the second and fourth production seasons are being seen. The third-season trailer is published, and there is a whole series of different districts.
During the next production period, the United States Police DEA has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world's most expensive trade.
The body responsible for the second was "like the Fortune 500 company", except that there are a lot more agencies to donate and to use.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejula (Damian Alcazar) leads the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejula (Francisco Denis) is the mind of it. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) makes contact with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
Recently announced trailer Pedro Pascal asks for a return to Javier Peñana, who is targeting US and Colombian police officers in the fight against drugs.

Kari Kola will perform an ordinary work of art in Paris.
A kind of lighting artist Kari Kola (in Kukava) will do an alternative to the first day of light set by the UN in Paris next year on 16th May of the year.
Kola is doing a Parisi piece of light art called Day and Night.
The works are the light and the sun and the moon.
The work illustrates the Fontenoy building at UNESCO headquarters and the Globe monument in front of it.
In my work, I want light not only in the dark but also in the dark.
The light level of the world today is a major factor that will help us all.
With the help of my art, I can make some real sense of what I have experienced," says the photographer Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased to be part of the first international day of light and to import light into the world, Kola.
Kari Kola attended the opening of the Year of Light in 2015, when she illustrated the Unesco headquarters for the anniversary.
I am not very privileged to be able to re-art at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may still be developing very seriously.
About this we will know later in the past, Kola continues.
The aim of International Light Day is to highlight the world of human beings and raise people's awareness of the fields of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
The First Light Day will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in the centre of the city on 17 May.

There was a dispute between two people in Espoo at the Big Apple parking lot on Wednesday afternoon.
According to the Parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove into the forbidden course of action.
There was a verbal dispute between drivers.
A driver driving a forbidden drive would drive another car to the driver, resulting in this car running into the car of the hitter.
Then he hit another car on the plane.
In the first speech, a man has caused injury and has done wrong.
The titled article on the word sign of Soin said, "Then came the flood".
Minister of Foreign Affairs Soini (U.S.) published a blog book on Thursday, which is titled with a question mark.
The article is brief, only two sentences in size.
During my time, the Party became the governing party of thirty-seven Members of Parliament from zero to thirty-seven.
After that, there was a flood, now everything is floating, so call it in.
There are references to 17th century France in the text of Soin.
It is known that King Louis XV or this goddess Madame de Pompadour has used the Flood comparison.
Depending on interpretation, history's books have left the flashes of "the flood after us" or "the flood after me".
According to the UN, the political role of Afghanistan's democracy in the fight against crime is a political one.
Vaalis are only represented if they can vote for all members of society, including those of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
In the meantime, Mr. Nicholas Haysom, the interim president of the UN mission, noted that hundreds of people are candidates for the municipal elections, three of them are candidates for Vice-President, and more than 30% of the registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized", Haysom said in his statement on Wednesday.
They can only be genuinely representative and credible if they are fully involved and are included in all parts of the election.
The regional council and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on 5-17 July.
The Taliban has made some serious threats at the same time as the international forces are moving towards a consultative role.
This year's is the first time that a peaceful transition from one country to another is taking place in the peaceful transition from one country to another.
Haysom said that women's efforts to promote democracy in Afghanistan would help them.
According to the Afghanistan Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

In western and central Europe there is a western south-west airflow and there will be some deaf roads.
In Europe in Europe, the weather is sunny and hot, and the temperature rises at approximately 40 degrees above the temperature.
There are silences in the middle of the east.
The flood of road tourists poses a threat to the culture of the region.
The authorities consider limiting the number of tourists in the United Kingdom.
In particular, there is a focus on the form of transformation represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs calls it "eat and flame": there is only one moment in the place and we are going through the big crowds.
Russia is to suffocate fast day trips to the cities of tourists.
There's a lot of hard work on the streets, and the fine spaces are so full of visitors that the people of Venice can't get together anymore.
They have been forced to move further away from the historical center after hotels have replaced the home.
The New York Times and The Guardian are written by The New York Times and The Guardian about the problems of tourism.
The authorities shall consider the links with the measures taken.
They call the current theme bad-quality change - low-quality tourism.
On arrival on a large cruise ship, two or three hours at a time.
You will take the next ticket guide from Romania to the Rialto Bridge and St. Mark's Market, and you will turn back, describe the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dario Franceschini's role and problems.
The beauty of the city is not only in the architecture, but also in the operation of the place, shops and workshops.
We must survive this part of the city.
The market for Markus is also one of the most popular visits to the historic centre of Venice.
The Holy Mark Church is located on the edge of the square.
Local disdain mainly affects cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 inhabitants living in the historic centre of Venice.
In 1911, there were about 17,000 inhabitants.
In this year, approximately 2,000 Russians felt against mass tourism.
According to the tourism industry, their quality of life, the environment, and the inhabitants are driven away.
About 2,000 inhabitants leave each year.
This is the case, in a few years' time, there will be no tourists in Venice.
It would also be anthropological and historical, to learn about the demonstration organized by Carlo Belframe.
It is difficult because ships bring their incomes to Venice and create an opening for many different sectors of employment.
In addition to limiting the appeal, the decision is envisaged to go beyond the historical centre of cruisers.
The situation of Luciano Bortot, who lives in Switzerland, would certainly change if the area in which Osatsi is located had more power to decide on their own matters - if not completely autonomous.
Some 20-30 million tourists visit Venice every year.
Are you driving in Kuopio?
Bad kilometre congestion on the highway.
On the motorway north of the road between Kuopou and Lake Siilin, there has been a traffic jam from work on Thursday afternoon during the period of return transport.
The area is equipped with engine coating, which updates traffic, says Savo’s Word.
There is a 50 km time-limit for the work instead of a 120 km time-time limit for the work.
However, the traffic of 25 km in the restricted area had reached a real pace of walking on Thursday afternoons.
On Thursday afternoon, on the side of Lake Silinjärve, the news reached the image of Revelation, or golden oatmeal.
I feel good about myself without attention.
A 23-year-old runner has found the curses of the public.
Amalie Iuel has published up-to-date images of itself, including in Grand Canyon landscapes.
The Danish-Nordic Amalie Iuel has become a popular athlete in his current home country, not least because he broke the 26-year-old record in the 400-metre run of the 26-year-old old by turning at the time of the race 51.81.
A month later, he improved a 400-metre drive-by at the time of record 55.38.
After records, Iuel, who was using the heavy social media, was able to notice that the reputation and the public are on the back.
Some people around the world tend to send Iulel the images of their sex organs, obviously in the hope that the young runner would be pleased with them.
Iuel was forced to stay out of his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "twilights" from an unknown person, so I had to turn my account into a private person, Iuel told VG magazine.
In the interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of pictures he got.
You can probably guess, Iuel narurekeli.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll do well without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Home is a Danish, father is a Danish Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway when Amalien was 2 years old.
When Amalien was 12 years old, the family moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, for work at home.
Then, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete (University of Southern California) in Los Angeles, from which I returned.
In June 2015, she changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is training at the service of three trainers, Leif Ola Alnes, Karsten Yorkholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
There is much more open in the United States than in the United States.
Coaches in the United States don't just ask questions.
The coach at home has much more time to deal with a sportsman in person, Iuel told VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norway's record at 400 metres and 400 metres in the procession.
The foot took Janne Korve's entire career to the stakes - now with him in the World Cup: "It's good to not hurt".
Now it's been nice to count when you haven't happened to anything.
Janne Korpi, 31, is one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, now actually enjoying her beloved way.
Last summer's career continued at stake.
The weight injury of the foot had forced the basket to the surgical table in January, and I wanted nothing to do with it.
The hand was in the middle of a fight, too.
Where I don't know what I'm doing, whether it's a game or not.
The sponsors were out of the question and many things, Korpi says.
Of course, it's said that there's a way to sort things out.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract by two years, and the blood again began to pull the line.
After that, the decision was easy.
I mean, every time I looked at it, the first time I looked at it.
I was in the middle of hell, but this is so much fun, let's have a little more fun.
It's not until October, but after a slow stop, it's been a lot of pain-free workouts.
There are only a few of them who have moved from Korpi to Korpi.
It's okay. It's okay.
They have never been the most important aspect of the service.
I've never done anything for a baby.
I think it's intimidating to aim for four years in one race, and then you're hot for that.
That's not what I'm thinking, Korpi says.
Today's Korpi race will be held in the cheap spot of the World Championships held in Sierra Nevada.
Although some races don't keep him in a game, he always gets caught up in a fight together.
According to the basket, the value of the competitions of the International Ski Trade Organisations has increased over the past few years, only some of the panelers at each of the same time holding X-Games.
This is the big one, the big one, the big one, the big one, the big one.
However, I feel that the value always depends on the conditions and the level of quality in which the goods are located.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in the 12-person team in Sierra Nevada in Finland.
The team's falls, aged 17 years, Rene Rinneš and Emmi Parkkissenniemi are 14 years older than Korpea.
It's nice to watch younger friends go.
I remember when I was in the process that everything was new and so excited about everything.
It'll bring itself new power, Korpi.
I'm still working on something, but by the way, I don't think so, that's how much power my friends have.
In the background of a fair career, Janne Korpi has also built a different Bible career.
The director-legenda Pekka Korve's son is hooked up with social sport: the driver has his own self-employed horses, which he does workouts.
When I'm on my way all the time, there's no way it's gonna be in the fair now.
I watch at least every day the results of my homework and, in general, something about leaving, Korpi tells me.
Treatment and health care are, according to Korve, an important career plan when the maintenance career is completed in due course.
I'm not planning it that way now, but it's probably an alternative.
I mean, it's as if I'm learning it right here in addition to snowboarding.
I'm just trying to get to the point of thought and thought, maybe in summer there's something going on.
If it's my future, it's not my future when it's already inside.
This is also the case of the Eltloppet training with Director Jaajo Linnonma.
Two has leased a cruise ship heading for the Eltloppet treatment competition in Stockholm at the end of the afternoon.
The Korpi and Lintomaa decided to reintroduce the new tradition.
Rice has gone well for sale, and people have been excited.
Now we're already at the point where there's no bankruptcy at all.
It's a few more months, so we'd like to get to the bottom of it, but Korpi says he's excited.
Annando's home spy project for Kite is surprisingly all.
Händo Ester is the name of a new 41-seat nursing home built for Kite.
The building of more than 1,700 blocks of floor area will be completed next summer on the other side of the health care centre's health centre.
The general question of wonder is what the new entity's clients are about, for now, during that time, many private doctors are making a lot of money.
Anne Flink, Regional Executive Director of Hoses, Annandö, commented that Kite has now more demand not only for options but also for improved service housing.
All kinds of services are needed, and when there are options, the choice of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Annando bought private hospitals in Kite, Kanervikkolan and Eerika.
Business was done, but the real estate is known to be a five-year lease.
Flink says that Holddo has no acute attempt to move away from these premises.
I'll see you tomorrow.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand of the Scottish factory.
The trade union will seek the support of McVitie's inventors for their long-term commitment to production at Glasgow factory.
According to the General Trade Union of the United Kingdom, according to the Scottish Department of the GMB, the company has not reported on its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are manufactured by more than 500 people.
The McVitie's brand's own company, Pladis, reported that he had invested more than five million pounds in the factory in recent years.
He added that if changes are to be made, the parties to the trade and trade union would be "repealed".
In his letter to the CEO, GMB calls on the company "to take care that no financing has been allocated for the modernisation of the production lines".
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, is very concerned that the CEO does not have any detailed information on the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"The families have been working here from one generation to another, and they have focused heavily on the local community and the capital of Glasgow, which is an important employer in the area of unemployment and low income.
For jobs, wages and income, as well as Brexit, rising costs of living and production for continuous reduction, the Eastern Glasgow needs a successful McVitie's production."
According to the journalist, the CEO had only received a letter from the trade union on the previous day and the company replied directly to the letter because it assesses continuous interaction between the employer and the trade union.
"We had a regular meeting with the workers and members of the GMB at Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of issues openly.
We discussed with the workers, among other things, the fact that, like other highly competitive and uncertain market-based companies, we continuously evaluate all of our operations and offices in order to maintain our competitiveness."
According to the public, the company has recently moved over £5 million to the Tollcross factory, in particular to its production sites and to improve its operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production plant, and we will certainly be the first to tell the first jobs and trade union representatives if we intend to make changes to their activities."

But if they want our players, they will face the consequences."
