The stars radiate light and energy because of the energy released when hydrogen atoms merge (or fuse) to create harder elements.
Scientists are working on creating a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve, and it will take many years before we are ready for the build of advanced nuclear reactors.
The blade needle remains on the water because of the surface tension.
The surface tension is due to the fact that the water molecules on the surface are more powerful at each other than at the atmospheres on their surface.
The water molecules form an invisible skin that allows things, like this needle, to float on the surface of the water.
There are two edges on today's owl that sometimes have a little bit of fun. These two edges make the right grip on the ice, and even if the blade is.

The image shows atoms radiating photos. Of course, the photons are much smaller in real life than the images shown in the picture.
Fotons are even smaller than the things that make the atoms.
