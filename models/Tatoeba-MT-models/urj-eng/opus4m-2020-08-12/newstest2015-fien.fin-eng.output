Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting civilians.
On Monday, President Vladimir Putin accused Kiev of refusing to engage in direct political discussions with the Eastern Separatists.
The current Kiev management does not want to engage in a substantial political discussion with the eastern part of its country, Putin said according to the Itar-Tass News Office.
He also said that the political separatists, who Kiova and I know were helped by the Great Army, tried to push the Ukrainian troops further than they did at the moment where Putin said that the Ukrainian army was shooting civilians.
The aim of the military is to push away these armed men and their cannons, so that they do not have the chance to shoot the residents of the region, said Putin.
The event took place on Friday and Saturday at the Rhythm Correction Bay.
I'm surprised the crowd got here from the beginning of the night.
There were hours in the last two days, as expected by promoter Tom Kangas.
The River Hiphopis was held on one occasion.
Next year again.
We're still going to be hiphop painters, which means pops aren't allowed, Kangas's conviction.

With the Valooli: Super Raheem was a parasite - Mario remained hidden - Valooliga - Ilta-Sanomat
The newly 19-year-old Raheem Sterling again showed how he is considered to be the future of the English world.
White Hart Lane had an electronic atmosphere open when Mario Balottella had returned to Tottenham's home.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English editors saw an Italian 24-year-old on the field in a very different attitude than in City time.
The ballet was still a long way from its peak.
The Italian lost three high-quality destinations and fed 16 to only half his team.
In the future, players who have already taken the player's favorites are looking forward to doing better.
The Liverpool-manager Brendan Rodgers planted Balotelli on his way to Barcelona to play Luis Suarez as the second attacker next to Daniel Sturridge.
Instead of Balotelli, the team stared at the middle diamond tip of Raheem Sterling, who went through the 3-00 victory important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 8, is not only for power, but for power.
Balodyllia 20 cents greater is between the adversary's foreheads than the fish in the water.
The essence is not common to a player who is bubbling on the lawn at least at a speed of about 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves a great deal of thanks for Sterling's development.
After the match, the Nordics told us how they have systematically developed a more comprehensive game of North-Western London, which grew up in Wembley's roots.

Rovamiläinen eng.Emperball player Woman Volley tripped to the anti-Aggressor Vampulan Sportsman at the Pipippus exercise tournament in the final.
Vampula turned five to one stretched match for 3-2.
The last WoVo lost 15-11 years ago.
The neighbor was always ahead of him.
The fight was good, but in the game and in the game Vampula was a little bit better, saw WoVon coach Teemu Mäkikyr.
WoVon's six was so busy that the 1 9 cent U.S. Center Jennifer Keddy was stuck behind her back.
Sara Niemi played in the centurion.
Karoliina Kylönen, despite her buttocks, was able to play and formed Johanna Pekkarinen in the most fiery division of WoVon.
The beginning of the hacking process, Jenna Mähmäki, was able to make room for Jana Jaudzeme for the last 1.5 hours.
The best part of the shortage was a skilled ex-copper and a slippery Häaelina Hämäläinen, which WoVo went around as far as possible.

Lidl will check the numbers in Finland.
In the financial year ending at the end of the year, the total turnover of Finnish houses in Finland was almost 25 per cent to a total of EUR 1,2 million.
Medium-term performance information on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement is expected to continue.

Ovarian cancer is more frequent in frequently populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and impaired treatment.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video as a tribute to the man who died in the game in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas have a higher risk of becoming free of charge than in cities.
Researchers went through more than 1,100 English patients with ovarian cancer in 2005 and reported that only 35% of women, i.e. more than one year after diagnosis, were diagnosed.
Researcher Susan Jordan QMR Berghofer of the Medical Research Institute confirms that in a few populated and remote areas, women are likely to die by 20% during the research period than those living in urban areas.
OTHER INVESTIGATION: New medicines may cause cancer of the sky and of the air.
The researchers went through the medical history for two years.
According to Mr. Jordan, age at the moment of diagnosis, ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also have an impact on survival.
In the older female and cancer, the probability of survival was highest.
Women living in remote and populated areas are likely to earn 20% of the population during the research period than women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside the city are less likely to survive an ovarian accident, but Jordan considers it possible to delay the diagnosis and to interfere with access.
"The physicians of psychological oncology handle this disease best, and their receptions are located mostly in major cities," says Jordan.
While remote care treatments are becoming more widespread and of limited importance, the investigator also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors, so that specialist doctors can treat patients closer to their homes, as well as programmes to support patients in home care.
According to Jordan's research, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their location, which requires better treatment and better cancer prevention programmes.
Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer funded research today in The Medical Journal of Australia.
Elisha Neavella, a mother of 33 years of age living in the Gold Coast, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer in March 2012.
The town of Rovaniemi wants to establish a staff park in the Park of Friends, which is located next to the hotel in Ostrobothnia.
The Board of Governors decided on Monday that the status plan for the Park and its surroundings should be set up in Osvitte, a service point to be visited by the public.
The draft proposal is requested for opinions by the Environment Board and the Lapi Ely Centre.
By means of a shift in the status chart, Parliament intends to allow for the development of a commercial commercial activity in the area of industrial activity.
It is planned to form a park that is in place between the current Park and the area between it and the river.
For the period from 15 August to 30 June, this date shall be valid for a maximum of 200 motorists.
You can also invest fuel points in a specific part of the site.
It is also recommended that a new park be equipped with a new transport service.
Rovaniemi town has rented a park area to safari companies during the winter time for car hire.
The rental agreement has been renewed in the last spring of 2014 and is in force for spring of 2018.
Even strong opposition has been voiced by the banking industry and by changes in the pattern.
The inhabitants of neighboring houses have been angry at both the vote and the fear of the pack.
However, regional emissions have been investigated, and the reports have not shown any significant minimum levels.
The news is also longer than the rest of the world.
The friendly park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure was moved any longer, hotel safari customers would have to transport safari to places of origin by buses that would be about 15 departures.
The area of the park of friendship and the surrounding environment is also, according to the world, as wide as possible, better than the places designated as substitute places of origin, such as, for example, the east side of the bridges of the Ounasjoki bridges.
The friendly park is good for its location, for example, because activities can now expand into the region of Ounaspaviljong, for example.
Bank consolidation is part of the urban strategy of Rovaniemi City Council, which aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for business by providing sufficient quality services in a logical and functional manner for affordable places.
The friendly park is only the center of a semi-general, which has not yet been put into effect, for the start of motorbreaming.
The fall in ownership is reflected in the world’s soils.
The decrease in the number of owners, especially in the group under 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden shops by ten people, as young consumers today achieve the main goal of the sale of the garden. The Financial Times reported on the study of the United Kingdom's Garden Trade Association (HTA) in Horticultural Trades Association.
According to the Financial Times report, renters account for only 55% of the money provided by the owners for garden maintenance.
The study has also shown that more and more people living in large-scale homes with no gardens, and the size of the garden is smaller when the front yard is built more and more often into a parking lot, and these factors also threaten the garden area, which is estimated to be about GBP 5 billion per year.
In London, the ownership of large-scale dwellings has fallen from 61% to 43% in six months, where the number of horticultural products used per household is least of all in the country.
According to HTA and the UK Barriers (RHS), the increase in renting or reduction in the size of the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, head of RHS, says that "other plants grown in transferable farming conditions are particularly popular among renters, since such plants may, if necessary, be included in the change".
According to the HTA report, the period from 1997 to 2005 was the booming season of the retail sale of ceramics, as the ownership and wealth of housing increased from the late 80s to the mid-90s.
The report also predicts that this year, this year, the weather will increase thanks to better weather conditions, which are worse than last year's March and last year's weather.
Turkey is questioning the US diplomat for the sake of the spy report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called on the country's most experienced United States of America to provide a report on the report on the U.S. and U.S. spying in the oceans.
According to Prime Minister Bullet, the U.S. Ambassador to Asia and Turkey discussed the report on Monday.
The Intersect, the German Der Spiegel and the Web magazine, have written that the documents provided by the National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States of America, issued by Snowden, reveal the main object of the U.S. and the United Kingdom's intelligence services as a spy.
According to the main news offices, President Recep Tayyip Erdoga's little report means that all large countries have been spying on each other.
The previous report on the spying on Ankara by the German main inquiry service, Ankara, led to a more angry turnout in the world.

The National Guard held two other local polices in connection with corruption charges, and they are judged together with Navarro.
The whole country newspaper ABC is one of the world's most angry parties of the enemies of the club owners, which made it difficult for them to do their business.
"It is no longer about money, it is about death," one of the owners pointed out to the court.
You are not ruining our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the headlines this summer, when YouTube was spread online, where an 18-year-old British waiter was making out with 24 men during the so-called pub cracklin.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to hide the drunken and uncontrollable behaviour of Magaluf's holidayers by using some of the infamous, alcoholic pub cracklie participants.
In addition, the home club, which was described in the oral video, was imposed for closure, and the penalty of EUR 52,000 was imposed on the owners of the rent club and the co-founder of the pub cravlin Carnage together to pay the fines of EUR 52,000.
In particular, among the smallest British tourists, the so-called balconing trend has also become popular in the tourist destination of Magalufi, which has caused several accidents caused by the use of suicide, after they have jumped from a balcony to another or a balcony to a hotel pool.

Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after having spent the summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mortars bombarded their communities in the 50-day Israel and Hamas War, and the schools survived as the region came up from the battles.
The opening of the home created joy and excitement in the rockets bombarded in the communities of northern Israel, but the battles are still visible.
In the nearby Ashdod town of Pashosh day-care center, workers removed traces of fragments from the walls and soluble before children were hit by a rocket in the day-care centre.
"We're a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in the "Kubbus", the Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the university.
In many countries, children in this area are severely in need of routines.
According to Shani Bart, the 11-year-old daughter of Bart, Shani Bart, the school is about to become "a little bit too late".
"We've had the same difficult times when we didn't leave our home anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbus near the Gaza border to provide his support.
Last week, thousands of people living in border regions like Saat had stayed indoors or left their homes for the most important countries in Gaza to escape the arrival of rockets and grenades.
Many of the residents of the Community of Nahal Oz, close to the Gaza Strip, are sceptical about the return of a four-year-old son killed by the Palestinian grenade in a group of four-year-olds.
According to the Ministry of Education, the fair ten had not yet returned.
Family homes are now placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited school in Sderot, near the border of Gaza, a city that was subjected to a heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the child to study hard and promised that "the child's education and safety will be taken care of".

Whether the ceasefire stopped the battles immediately, but it did not bring about a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas's demand for the removal of Israel and Egypt and the re-opening of Gaza's air and sea routes.
he wants to take off Hamas's weapons and take down the body of a two-war Israeli soldier who died in war.
We are looking forward to the start of a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2 100 Palestinians died during the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed on the number of convictions, according to which at least half of the dead were civilians, although it has not been proven to be acceptable.
On the side of Israel, there were 66 soldiers and nine men, including, among other things, the Thai Church.
Hamas and other Gazaese policemen fired 4 591 rockets and grenades at battles to the Israeli cities mostly in the north.
In turn, there were more than 5,000 attacks and other attacks.
The attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and nearly 250 000 people fled to over 100 UN-run schools that had been transformed into giant shelters.
Tens of thousands of people still under protection and as the fights continued, the schools moved from school to school last week.
"I hope that the school will open soon and we will return to school, just like the rest of the world and just like the children of the Jews," said the 13-year-old Mohammad Amara, who lives in a school in Gaza City, said.
The average average increase in housing prices has been the highest in the three-year winter months of Australia.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings in the capital of Australia rose by 1.1 per cent in August, showing RP's data on Monday.
Over the period of June, August and August, the number of nights actually increased by more than one year after 2007.
The annual price increase was 1.9%, which is more than twice as many as one year in the last 12 months of 2013, whereas prices have not risen evenly throughout the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Data's research director, Sydney and  mother are at the top of the rise.
RP Data shows that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and by 1 per cent in Melbourne last year.
The Adelaiden, Brisbane and Darwin apartments markets are the most prosperous in the world, with the highest price range of five to six per cent.
The lowest housing market is in Canberra, where prices only returned 1.4 per cent per year following government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring that started in Australia will increase the number of dwellings on the market in the coming months, which is the real estate market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of dwellings in trade, the overall high sales rate and the ever-low average ratio, it is considered that the net sales of housing in the next three months are still net", says Lawless.

Lenny Henry says: "My father never failed me."
I never said I would love me
The birth of a seven-year-old family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley, the United Kingdom, in the Midlands in 238 C.E.
Henry's father was at work and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently practicing for the Rudy's Rare Records comedy show, which is part of his father's imaginary conversation with him and has been developed on the basis of the set of Radio 4 channels.
The sound is a mixture of rhinestones and raps in the upbeat pace.
Henry has had to go through a lot of people's memories.
He's been on several occasions since his mother's death, and he's been thinking a lot about his relationship with his father.
The father was very hard to understand.
Never seen a face, just a voice said: Stop the noise.
Take it easy on your sister.
Go! Go!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My parents Seymour and Aki, who were already adults when I was a child, visited the house in the pub and talked, for example, about the shape of a beer cup or the beauty of a sipper.
I never talked to him about such things.
For the most part of my life, he was me, the insolent man in the corner, in the back of his newspaper.
Recently opened a metal alloy in Dudley, and this gave him an idea of how his father's life must have been, even though working conditions are now better than at that time.
The mills are now slightly brighter, but they are currently dark, white, Labyrinth-like depths, with flames, wood and smart, and which bring me back to mind.
He used to go to the third party and just land in a bathtub, and he almost started to laugh by himself to wash the digesting dirt off of himself.
As I walked around, I realized that he was working for years to get us a meal, and I began to feel more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s childhood lacks the closeness of his parents’ husband and wife.
My father never died and never said that he would love me.
when my mother was getting sick shortly before she stopped, we began to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has Billie-tried with Dawn French, and through his own child he has been able to share the love of the man who was missing as a child.
You keep saying, "Do I love you?"
Now, come on, give me a hug.
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be here?
He's a cop.
Henry is still a good friend with French, whom he married for 25 years.
Dawn is.
Why wouldn't Darn and I be alone?
He's a liar.
She had her own house with her own toilet.
It was also one of the reasons for the mother’s death.
When I began to suffer from excessive overweight and symptoms, my help asked me to make a full translation.
After that, I started to feel better, and I also had to start making a hard diet call.
It's very difficult -
And cool.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's knowledge, a brief beard, describes his change in the course of his career.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from the protesters, Othellona is sinking in the process.
The next was the comedy of error and the Fences of August Wilson ("Aids").
Making a theatre offers the same experience as the sitcoms and comets that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
In the meantime, an employee of 16-year-olds only started working in the field.
One of the dishes caught him on the stage doing imitations and contacting the New Faces performance contest.
Henry's TV career started in the middle of the '70s.
Henry's work done.
I was supposed to grow up in the public spotlight, I had to learn how to make the keys in the slide straps in the years 2000-1985, while living in the star and I was in the television, and that was a long time ago.
Lenny in the New Faces Competition in the year
Henry's manager had a screenplay on The Black and White Minstrel Show, an air show where people appeared in black makeup, so they ended up in comics for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I wish I had never been involved, but I don't regret it.
While I was in a place where I was deaf and mean, I got to work at huge events and I learned how to deal with the audience.
Yet, "British TV award-winning, each favorite and cable entertainment program" was, at the same time, "a sleek barody barodian about people who are mutilated".
He worked in the second comedy series in the '80s, where he made both a joke and admiring a black British culture.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s Henry was known as the character of the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series 'Cf!'!
The following year Henry spent the next year with ads, documents, TV shows and film parts, but in 2008 he said, "What are you going to do, Len - now it looks like you're just going to be lying there or playing on the sidelines".
The next item was the Radio 4 document series "What's So Great About...?"
In the first part, Shakespeare was discussed.
I've always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
In fact, not really taught us well at school, and I think it belonged to the middle class, which wears socks and has money.
The Shakespeare theme gave me fear.
The interviews we interviewed in each program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Test.
Don't forget the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Say the words and understand why we all thank Shakespeare so much.
Henryi said 20 words about Othello's last talk for the document and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It seemed like a part of me was missing before, and now it's gone.
"That's what this is all about, so take it seriously, learn your lesson, do a little research.
The exercise process was therefore difficult, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
The opinion was a success.
Obviously, it was expected to fail, and that is not exactly the case.
Shortly thereafter, he played the main part in the case of errors.
Suddenly I played at the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
In my mind, I thought, "Oh, you're changed."
There was trouble once in the play, and Henry clearly recognized that he had to do his job of entertaining the audience.
I said in my mind, "You have to do it again, you have to do it again."
On the other hand, the assistant informs us that the presentation will be made whenever the problem is right.
I walked out on the scene, and part of my great relief.
That is not my duty,
I can leave it to someone else.
"You're part of the play, stay back."
Henry "Fences" plays at the Duchess Theatre.
It was difficult to learn what happened to the "Fences" show.
Packing is a good thing, it makes the world more popular.
This play was also well answered, so it was like an expression from the gods; "That's what you have to do."
Of course, this is Henry speaking with KMELLA.
I mean, I decided to stay here.
I am sincerely working on this work.
I used to work out practice rooms.
However, the essence of this is still a coma: small hulks are constantly talking about him changing from one impersonation to another.
Holding on to the Stand-up Comic is the will, and it seems dangerous to receive immediate thanks from the unknown public.
If you keep thirsting for it, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at Apollo, when it seems, but generally it no longer inspires me as before.
I'll ask Henry if he's going to go on a new stand-up tour anymore.
It is a real pleasure for me to sit down with a tutor who will help you shape the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don't think I ever want to give up on that feeling.
So this is its rebirth today?
I think so.
I like acting--
It's really fun.
When you're ready, you'll tell me again, and when you do, you'll be happy.
I love stories.
People stories.
Who is to be drawn up by an official post for the purpose of the title of "craft workers".
Who has begun to draw up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "forged workers" from the government's payroll.
Workers who did not register for the next two months would no longer be paid, the Commission was informed.
The government has doubts that they will continue to be paid after they have left their officials.
President Uhru Kenyatta promised to break down public-sector corruption after taking up office in 2013.
According to the previous year's audit, the monthly average cost of " ghost workers" in wages and other economic transactions was one-tenth of a month.
The government suspects that wages will be paid to the account after the person has died or left his official post, the BBC Wanyama Chebusiri reports on the capital city of Nairobi.
All officials should report to the register during the following weeks at the identification centres in order to ensure that their information is stored in a biometric format, reported in the communication.
All those who do not do so without due cause will be removed from the price.
"This measure greatly rationalises the general sector, because it defines how many people really work in their tasks, and it also cleans the wage levels at the same level as the company, which solves the problem of "forework workers", says Anne Baigru, the Minister of Finance for Diversification and Design.
In the meantime, the annual income of 2015 may amount to EUR 25.5 million, unless the city adjusts its activities and expenditure in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual budget will remain at around 9.4 million per year.
Possible means of efficiency were to increase the size and level of the population, and to increase consumer sales, property sales and subsidies, as well as tax and payment revenues.
The investment of EUR 10 million of the reduction target is worth millions.
There's no relief in places where people are allowed to be.
The general obligations imposed on municipalities, the inadequate growth in incomes, the increase in unemployment, and the fifth-percent increase in public contributions are continuing to increase again.
The aim of the economic seminar is to find new ways to balance the economy.
The Board of Directors agrees that savings must be made.
The vessel must be turned to its main objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, President of the Government.
The Board of Governors has yet to set up the Executive Board for preparation.
The proposals of the Board of Governors will be the basis for the preparations for the run-off at the Board's Economic Seminar in Fram on Monday, 8 September.
After a meeting of the Board of Governors, the draft budget will proceed through the Board to the Board of Governors and the Council of Governors.
Tens of Turkish police were arrested as suspects against the "run" government.
A total of 33 people have been arrested in law for suspecting "the anti-government plot", reports local media sources.
The police did not comment immediately.
According to Huriet Daily News, 14 senior police officers were among the prisoners.
The police were involved in last December's anti-corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were held accused of organising and following a wide range of drugs in the police force.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (which was the main player in this period) said that the measures taken were part of the planned work of President Fetäh Gullen, President of the Republic of Estonia, and others in power.
Not all go to school
The Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1st September) after the summer holidays.
This is traditionally an important day for each other, and like some other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took him to school.
While telling the expected journalists that not all schools have reopened, he said he was committed to supporting the country for future generations:
The first day of September was not held in each school.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole of Ukraine, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is a leading teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenyukin's daughter goes, speaks Russian.
We hope that peace will come back here and that they will be able to learn a way that is real today.
The first day of the day is usually attended by the children’s usually written shirts, balloons, and giving flowers to teachers.
According to the Texas Perry, the disgusting TWT was illegal.
In the middle of this hearing, in the hearing of the accusations of the abuse of power, Governor-in-Office Rick Perry's Twitter account sent an insulting picture of a democratic attorney.
The theme was later removed and followed by a new tweet where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The TEET was sent to my account without permission.
"I will not accept the Tweet and I have deleted it", stated later in the publication.
Perry's background immediately failed to respond to the requests for improvement.
While the tweets are being sent from a Twitter account under Perry's condition, it is not clear who the picture was.
The first tweet contained an insulting pictorial picture of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was convicted of driving in April 2013.
Perry sti sti felmberg's office when he refused to resign, which led to a general jury meeting in Austin this month in the hands of Perry. Perry is the 2016 presidential election.
The main story of the week was: "I don't always drive drunk, three times more pros... but when that happens, I blame Governor Perva on pointing finger".
I am the most humic Democrat of all time.
The Legal Office did not conduct a major jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antion, who was appointed by the Republican Judge.
Perry has said he's innocent and has called the attacks a "get out of the way".
In his powerful judicial services, he has asked the judge to abandon the pleas and said that the law under which the governor most prominent in Texas is accused of being accused of being indiscriminately unclear against the truth.
Perry cut the United States State aid to a public inviolability unit operating in the Travis District and carrying out public sector attacks when Groupberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision was the subject of an official complaint from a reliance observation group.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is regularly updated – and sometimes famously.
During his 2012 presidential election in Iowa, Perry threatened to finish with a tie by publishing a copy of the image at the end of the sitting in the lake with the text "Here, South-Caralina!".
According to Berkeley, the housing market is again "normal".
One of the two main building managers in London has asked that the housing market in South-East England have "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The main demand and sharp price increase of the London Capital Houses, while the fear of widespread credit bubbles, has been causing the bank to lay down restrictions on housing laws in the run-up to the bank.
The founder of the high-level builder Berkeley and Chairman Tony Piggley said on Monday that "the first half of each marketing year and the volume of trade have returned to normal since 2013" and added that this has enabled "a stable environment".
In the housing market in London, during the recession, foreign investors sought, in particular, to the capital.
According to the country register data, the average prices of dwellings increased by 1 percentage point only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of English and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average prices of private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley rose by about one fifth of the year, reaching 423 000 pounds by the end of December.
However, the strengthened pound has made a less attractive item than the London real estate in the last few months - some of the interest has also been influenced by the new real estate tax laws and the agency's rhetoric of any "map tax" before yesterday in general.
Last time Foxtons, a Dutch real estate agent, warned that the 4th mortgage loan report, which reported the tightest lending orders, would lead to a higher market growth both in real estate sales and in terms of prices in the second half of the year.
The latest information from the market on Monday shows that the volume of loans in the form of loans dropped in July, suggesting a fresh market for the apartment.
The average broker Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast for the prices of London real estates, according to which prices are calculated by three per cent, since the index of prices to be measured by the owners has already started to decline.
The number of transactions in London's most expensive area of business in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen a quarter of a year ago, reports WA Ellis.
However, home demand in the capital is a Bible for Berkeley, who generated income from the sale of real estate to more than 2.2 billion dollars.
Pidgley added that "the demand for the best quality of the product at the best times has remained stable and therefore the industry has remained busy".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3 742 houses in the second year. This is just the third more than in the first year of the peak of economic growth in 2007.
Year-on-year before-tax profits went down by 40 year-on-year, therefore, by GBP 380 million and by turnover by 18 million, by year-on-year, by year, by year-on-year.
On Monday before the annual annual meeting, Pigley told us that the annual market share for the year was the same as the current market share.
Analysts agree that all year-on-the-year payout is £2 million.
Berkeley's share sold on the London Stock Exchange at a steady price of £23,96 this afternoon.
The hacker leaked Jennifer Lawrence's naked images into the network.
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the Academy Awards Awards awards ceremony in the eighth year.
A hacker who claims to hold a hundred other fake images leaked into the network of an Oscar actor from Py Lawrence.
The representative of the Falsifying Letter indicated that the images were genuine and condemned by the hacker for "serious privacy abuse".
The authorities have been contacted, and all those who make the stolen pictures of the english Lawrence will come to the fore.
The images originally published on the 4chan screenshot page were apparently in the wrong hands because of the stability of the Apple iCloud storage system. A hundred other hacks are supposed to have ten other characters, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Cate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the picture is real, though Scott Pilgrim v World Star Winteradad judge in the know-how of the hacking.
"For those who look at my and my husband's home in the last few weeks ago: you're welcome to have a good time," said Winstead.
However, the Victoria Justice of the "iCarly" and "Victorious" series of Nickelodeon, however, denied the reality of the images and meant that "this so-called silent images of me about me are unrecognizable, do you not understand".
Let me finish this right at the beginning of .
BuzzFeeden later announced that the representative of the pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images relating to the star.
We all welcome the new novel that has received the thanks of Howard Jacobson, which tells us about love and J letters.
They dissolved, it was the best thing that happened, at one time they went off like an out-of-sealed cardboard box.
Only then did she hear from the woman that she was too serious, too smug, intense, untidy, and perhaps a little bit of a pain in the ass.
Then he swinged the other way.
He felt like he was all over the place.
Yes, he was like a peacock.
The last time I saw him, he had been in a relationship at the beginning, which, however, had been promising; it had seemed that this would have helped him to be lonely, and it might have been possible to create something of his own.
Ain Solomons had unspoiled hair, and he was a gentle beauty with a happy heart, from a northern village that was even rougher and more than Port Reuben.
She had come to the west with an older traveler, whom Kevern thought was her aunt. Aunt had inherited, who was in the wild but in the earthly valley, and the name of the valley was ideally called the Paradise valley.
The house hadn't lived in a house in years.
The trees leaked, all the bathrooms had spiders, the distances had left behind in the windows while the whole place was in their own, the garden was full of weeds that looked like a lot of cranberries.
The cottage was like children's fairy tale, while at the same time threatening and magical, the secret of the world.
Author's story: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" is nominated for the Booker Literary Prize in 2014.
Dates and conditions for next week
Kever had been sitting in his hand with Ailin in the hand with a few steel chairs, having a pleasant, warm spring afternoon, both of whom listened with a sense of mind to a welcome through which the whole country heard calm music and calming news when Ailin's cross-created, sun-brown legs brought in the Kevern mind song, which had long since been played by a black performer, and which his father had often seen his father snooping the cabin down.
Your leg is.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played at the reception.
There was no such thing — nothing was actually written — but they were no longer written.
They wanted to forget, like the word never did.
Public opinion led to what the laws and the announcements were not intended: just as in the literature section, people chose to read heroes' memories, cookbooks and romances, as well as in music, they prefer ballads.
In the wild of day, Kevern began to play with an imaginary piano and sing a serenade to the big feet of Alin with a mean, loud voice.
Anilin didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and, by the way, he raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This father always had before the "j" letter tried to escape his lips.
It had started playing with him and then.
The father told me he was playing the same game with his own father.
If you let the word "j" out of your mouth and you didn't remember to put two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay for a penny.
It wasn't really funny at the time, and it wasn't fun at the moment.
He knew it was expected from him, that's all.
I had to think about what jazz is.
Ani had never heard of anything like it.
Jazzi wasn't exactly a published language, it wasn't just a written language.
Improvising was no longer in fashion.
There was only one word in life for one word.
At the beginning of the song, people want to know exactly where it ended.
The upheaval had behaved in the same way.
Its unpredictableness made man perceptible.
Jazz was a bit of a rush through music.
Even though by 10 years of age, he had not been familiar with Sammy's music, the jazz music had become familiar with him through his half-history CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Aimin that Fats Waller was black.
In view of the fact that the age of Alicin was likely to not remember a time when popular singers were not black.
Nor did there need to be laws or coercion.
The well-known idea meant that each of its parts was well-informed — thanks to the principle that they were like saved on a lucky trade — that each group did things that were natural to it.
On the basis of their facilities and physical characteristics, African-Capbian families are ideal for entertainment and sports, so they were able to learn and run.
Originally from the Indian continent was like having electrical equipment, so it was important to make sure that there was a telephone in every aspect of the world that was working on matters.
Those who were left of the Polish community are working as pipes; the last Greeks broke the board.
When it came to the truth, those from the Gulf and the Middle East, whose grandparents had not fled in a hurry to fear that they would be accused of burning flames and fear that the flames would reach them next, they opened up the food, that they would make labneh yoghurt and burn water, and the rest would look down on the ground and be bored.
Let each act according to his or her own qualities.
All I had heard was the ballads, and he was hard to understand how Kevern just told me the insulting words he had ever been dressed as music.
Through music, love is shown.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
But also for the reeds' senses.
My life never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He was already overdoing it, but the abandoned spell created a climate of protection.
One word would not pass through the voice-closing process of the milky cranial stems.
Anin still didn't understand.
Why would you want to do something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a one-off, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his face with Ailinen.
I thought she was home already.
"It was nice of me," he said instead.
An seemed to be disbelief, and his hair covered Kevern's sight.
All over the world, nothing to see except the giant of Aliment, the shadow of a hairdo.
There's nothing else he wants to see.
"If that's what you're saying," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
That doesn't make sense.
I think she seems to be really confused.
Is my feet so big?
He looked again.
Your head isn't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you're afraid of me because my ankles are too thick?
Do you think so?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
She could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.
"I think you're attractive because of your fat ankles," he tried to make it happen.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This was no help.
He wanted it to sound silly.
More often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm to control the fiery truth.
Or his father meant to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted the same thing.
Despite the agreement, no matter what the agreement is,
Ain Solomons, with a steel chair and a steel chair, crammed the receiver and the shiny wine that they had just had been drinking.
It was all about the back, too. He couldn't blame it.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be shaking like the leaves of a palm tree in the storm.
"and you're the thick one," he says...
Except I don't feel like it.
Kevern was sorry for Ailin, both because of his own, unnecessary, cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in this regard at the moment that Aimin decided to stand up against him.
Did I think she'd shoot?
He had never told Kevern about a life in the north of the island where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that it was basically the same as life here.
the strong, the weak, the against the waves.
The same mixed-up men, although even more paleer and brighter after that, than their smuggler and screw-ups, wandered from the pub to the pub, to hit every woman who would dare resist or tease them.
Fat head?
Still, he'd see a thick fist, if it weren't for a second.
Sow first – the kiss had become the most common word for a male and female lonely encounter; first and then blow out the receiver against the unimportant spirit ends that are pumping out; and then suck first and then again.
Who I think it was too, since it was already hostile in itself.
An Solomons' body told him to leave.
He pulled himself out of a terrace chair like a old man.
I'm sure she's a little drowsy, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprises her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely meant each other.
Ani was following him — just as her traveler watched Kevern go from the top of the window — a man who was responsible for his life.
Adam from the garden, he thought.
I feel sorry for Kevern and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against me.
The man who turned his back, which had lost all the will to fight — whereof he felt that he was so familiar with that look, even though he did not remember that once before he had seen it like this?
While Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
The rest of the years before the recent event was described as intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who was working on the General Mind in a long-term private institution in Ofnow, did a little research on the outbreak of small and medium-sized violence in countries where violence was, or was, put an end to, most likely took into account the money and money used for it.
"There is much to be done, and much to be done," he said, "to compensate for the thousands of years of art and most often the natural aggression of the winning people, especially in those abandoned and remote places, where there is little knowledge of human mercy in the past of the church over the bushes.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the worse the emotions it causes.
He cries among the sentimental ballades, covets stories about the trials and swears in the name of the good of life and life, but at the same time, the traditional truth keeps me steady when it comes to both rural communities and urban communities, and there is also evidence of a new, more uninhabited reaction to violence in homes, workplaces, streets and even in shelters.
"You must choose a tendency to dramatize," her supervisor commented after reading the entire report.
I mean, you read less novels.
First Nussbaum put his eyes on the ground.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I need to talk to you," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
The first appealed to him again not to answer any personal questions.
The second-hand machine?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I am opposed to atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices at work.
We are servants of a prejudiced society.
Although some hypersensitivity in itself is totally acceptable and acceptable, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, such as what you just presented to me.
I am clearly thinking of something against religion — and what you call cruelty or malice, others usually call natural energy and force.
It's like something happened, if it happened at all, would destroy the basic life of the earth.
Esme Nussbaum was about to talk about Rabinowitz.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, a flame-prone LED light announced a guide that Ofnow had already distributed to the country for the fourth or longer of the previous century.
Smile for your neighbor, find your partner, listen to the ballads, visit the music, use your phone, ask, reason, listen, agree, ask.
Talking is better than silence, and the Bible word is better than what you know, but no one can win the love.
"I understand well what you want to say," said Esme Nussbaum, in a silent voice, when he was sure that his supervisor had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we think we are.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to the beginning of the
True, this time we do not pour out our sins and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz used a ring of pyramids.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"You're going too far", he said, "in your picture as 'mistakes', the actions that our big fathers may or may not have done.
You also go too far when you say that they poured out their hate and mistrust to others."
As you are, it should not be recalled that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no "we" or "other".
That was a lot of time, that's all we know about it.
"If I'm being honest, there's chaos," Esme dared to say, "no community can say that he behaves well.
No, it's not.
Whatever it is, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's done, it's good or bad.
That's the time.
There is no need to talk more about the matter – that is what I agree with.
And just as it is unnecessary to share attacks, there is no need to make any adjustments, whether they are due or not, and even if there is one way to do them.
But what for the rest of the world is there then, if it is not learned --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If there's one more thing I can do --
Luther Rabiowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said and said that Esmen was time to leave.

Accidents happen.
Lesoth's army refuses to plan a strike; it is in South Africa.
The officials of the lesbian army have banned the attack on the plotting of a government that had been set up and said they were working against a polka, which was suspected of trying to arm up gentile fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and had taken over the government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The head of the country went with his family to a foreign country in South Africa after telling him that he had been killed.
The military representative, Major Ntle Noti, denied the attack and said that the army was thus responsible for the threat that came from "political fanatics." It has been said that he has failed to arm fanatics.
"The Polish Defence Forces took action after obtaining a number of intelligence that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics in the face of these problems," he told the Force of America News Office.
According to the President of the United States of America, Mr. Clayson Monyela, military actions seemed to be an attempt to revolution.
"Although no one has claimed to have reversed the government by force, the actions of the Lesotho Defence Forces are all signs of an equivalent revolution," he says.
According to the officials of the Polish army, the soldiers return to their armies in return, and there was a peaceful atmosphere in the capital city.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says he believes that action is being taken because he is trying to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June when Thabane interrupted the plenary sessions because of the differences between the large coalition and the conflict.
He thus denies the power of the government, as is claimed.

The fourth tip for better underwater pictures and videos.
If you want to take a picture or video of the water, you have several different options to choose from.
The most important alternative is a breathtaking, compatible co-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which cost about $300.
I myself took these pictures in the family section using a number of different cameras, each of which is under the heading.
Depending on the device, there are a number of rules that need to be followed.
Check your device twice every time.
You should have a waterproof camera, make sure that the two batteries and other parts are watertight.
In addition, set up the two description settings to match the images or video you take.
Some cameras or combinations of machines and videos have a regulation to optimise the conditions of description under water.
Also, before you jump into the water, make sure to how deep your device can be taken.
Some people only endure the depth of 5 feet, up to 50-60 feet.
Take a look at both common and water-like models in our shopping guide and digital cameras.
pictures — many of them try in some way.
The large chambers have an LCD view, which allows you to tune the image, while the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you had an LCD, it's to see the water under, and you can either fail or fail to play a game.
So take one picture.
If your computer also allows for forklifting, which means taking one picture at a time at a different time, using this feature.
Close to the surface.
It reduces significantly more.
If possible, stay close to the surface while you photographing a swimming pool, lake or sea.
In this way you can also imagine more colors; the deeper you go, the less colors you can see.
Try to get close to the object that is being described.
This is an important advice when describing the ground, but even more important water, because the conditions of light are weak.
It is very important when an action camera is in place: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object in order to fill the whole image with the frames.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge.
Parliament decided that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the lack of concern for democratic reform.
It is likely to give a spark to the long-awaited protests of the Hong Kong business world after the start of planning and executing protests only hours after the decision has been made.
The decision of the United Nations to give real power to the Communists to rule out all candidates who do not lynch the Beijings.
"This was an attempt, but it is still infuriating," says the President of the Democratic Party, legislative director Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with the sovereign administration.
Deputy Secretary-General Li Fei of the Committee of the People's Republic of China, Li Fei, defended the Chinese Administration, saying that the general nomination for the president of Hong Kong would be too "out of chaos" in the appeal to the President of the People's Republic.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the inhabitants of the region that it would have to decide for itself from 2017 onwards.
According to the Directors of the PRC, this decision was a democratic breakthrough, as it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control the electoral process through the electoral process, which is managed in Beijing.
One sentence states that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be adopted.
During the first summer, some of the largest and most significant protests took place in the region for years.
A major part of the campaign for the defence of democracy was the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which has been threatened by the organisers to prevent the operation of the business quarter if Beijing does not grant a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday, only hours after the decision was changed, hundreds of Occupy Central's supporters met in a rain for Hong Kong headquarters buildings.
In the mind of the movement’s organisers, the movement was announced by the new civil disobedience to the era and they brought about Protestant waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not give details clearly, fearing that this would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their online release, the organisers said that the movement "takes the Occupy Central Tamp as the last way to use it only if there is no hope for a dialogue and there is nothing else to do with it".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance for dialogue is to be overrun and the central takeover will take place.

Today's expectations and expectations are very different from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now it's more important than a memorable impression, and VIF is the right way to do it.
However, the national facilitator criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to the Vice-President of the College, Megan Dunn, "this service plan seems to be really about the majority of students".

Ball: Fans' encouragement too much: Sasu Salin had passed out on the field
Soccer Sasu Salin was today the body count of the victory in Finland.
He was able to imagine his heart in the United States fight and back the blood of Ukraine in the second half of the time with his sedentary solutions.
But Salin transferred all the glory to the susifans and did it the way he did it:
I was going to go down on that field at the end, and that incentive was so great.
In my eyes, my mist, it couldn't help.
That noise and the public sea were too much for me.
The gym's power stations contained nine surfaces at fast speeds, spheroids, records and workpieces everywhere.
I don't know what it was like, but I'm getting into one of those fhe-states that everything's going to work out.
They come at some point, right now, in a really important place, Sasu glowed.
That's what I do.
Do all that stuff.
Now it was a start to see that the rest of us were on the same page as the others.
He grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team funnel and spirit creator, so it is no wonder that he raised the whole team to a flight that was too much for the big and hard-working Ukraine's five.

The average length of players has increased.
The game is even faster," I thought Parkkali.

Finns like the Cita dog mountain in Norway: "These men deserve all the thanks".
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and his children fell short on the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo offered to help bravely.
The weekend spent looking for Mikkelsen on Facebook for "International heroes" so that I can thank you again for your help.
Mikkelsen announced in a public Facebook update that a Cita dog with him on Thursday's mountain hurt his cup.
The injured dog was no longer able to operate in a steep terrain.
I tried to keep it down myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to catch and pull it forward a lot, but it was not just the feet that were carrying it, Mikelsen's update.
According to Mikkelen, the help did not come from the police, the nearest hotel or the passersby.
In the dark of the night, the beginnings of the night seem already violent.
There were two pedestrians standing there who were ready to help: the Tampere Given Fonti and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest place on the Galdhøpiggen and headed to their camp when they saw the pitch of the honey and the grass.
(Micellen) was somewhat calm with regard to her.
We served home with my dog, Antti Sokoni will tell Ilta-Saom in a message sent to him.
There was also a German man who was soon to come, and he had a rucksack with him.
A few of the types of people who were caught in the victim's body were sent from the mattress to Cita.
The German guy came right after us when we were thinking about what to do with the baby and carrying the baby down the slope for a minute," says My voice.
KINGS: That's what I'm talking about.
The dog was transferred by means of a routing tube.
According to Soin, the performance was not really heavy, but it was a while ago that we were carrying out our work on a difficult land.
However, after about one and a half hours, Cita was found to be well down.
After what happened, Mikkelsen was still looking for "International heroes" on Facebook to thank you once again.
You responded this summer, but the German man is obviously still unprovoked.
I don't know what I would have done without this hero, Mikkelsen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
Here we are, because I feel that I don't thank them enough.
They certainly do not know how much I am.
These men give all thanks and glory, I am a God to them.
On Monday afternoon, you were on your way home.
They had been happy to hear from Mikkelsen: - Cita said she was feeling better already.

In fact, the diagnosis of an error is wrong.
For many years, the British woman was afraid of telling the truth about the wrong diagnosis.
Carin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he only had four months to live because he was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he was working on Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), which means a set of hereditary diseases that damage the nerves between the brain and the spine.
According to Charity CMT UK, the false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because they are known to be so widely.
It is estimated that some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are suffering from CMT disease, which causes symptoms in motors, such as low body weight, hard walking and toes.
The disease may also cause anesthesia or pain, and it is inescapable and transient, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
Rodgers, when he was 13 years old, thought he had Friedreich ataxia (FA), which really has a bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed in a wheelchair before he turned 18 and died before he reached 30 years of age.
Today, the mother of two children aged 51 says, "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell daily, and I lasted more than anything else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran differently than the others.
Rodgers, when he was 13 years old, had performed several single-person operations to process his feet. After the surgery, he looked quickly at his research papers, which said that I had an FA disease, when he left the room for surgery.
"I felt guilty, because I was so curious, so I didn't tell you, but when I got home, I came home to the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When I learned from them, I was in a dire and diabolical state.
I'm going to be in a wheelchair by 18 years and I'm going to die before I'm 25, and in the meantime, I'm going to lose my full function.
I've been doing this myself and I've been planning my own funeral.
Rodgers tells us that by 17 years of age he said that he was not as upset as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
And all he did was hug me and say, "girl, I don't think you have this disease, because otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you're suffering from something less dangerous than anything else.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
"When I was told what a CMT disease is, I thought I'd lost it," he says.
The Charity CMT UK is preparing a CMT month to pay attention to mental illness.

The wishes of the basketball team for the future are at stake when Finland faces today in the second match of the World Championships in Ukraine.
If the opening stock was expected for the United States, it is again one of the countries from which I should like to take the necessary profits in the future.

The Hollywood stars' claims are spreading online - some are confirmed for real.
There are a number of nude images in the area that are said to be known to the public.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has become the victim of "infective campaign".
The reference website TMZ is a public consultation of Lawrence's representatives, which shows the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross privacy insult.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence (on the Internet) will be charged, threatened by representatives.
According to TMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images that spread from her to her are real.
He had taken those pictures with his husband a few years ago.

I feel sorry for all those who fell victim to the hacking, according to the site.

Football Club FF Honka is currently in the final position of the Toy League.
Earthman Walter Five's comments after the festivities of the VPS match well reflect the mixed current situation of the club.
I haven't had a goalmaster in four months.
Of course, everything has to be done", says Vital after the battle that ended in 1-2 loss.
Honka made a lot of mistakes during the first half of the month.
Landguard Viitala was not in a bad mood for playing games of defense.
The gamer is in Hong Kong this summer, and that is why the defenders in each aspect have changed rapidly.
With the help of the role role role role, many young players have created opportunities that they may not even earn.
"Some of them don't work too hard to get them out of here," the Five didn't make it to any single player.
Hefki Kuqi, head coach of Hungary, was somewhat in agreement with Viilä.
"I told every player after the game that if you come to training and play games to have fun and think you're a betting league player, and you don't have to work, you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I'm for many young people.
If they don't want to take that place and use it for good, it's not my fault.
Kui also recalled, however, that players cannot be expected to succeed as a result of the constant change of gamemates.
This period has not been twice in the same composition.
Especially at the right end of the team has changed.
That is the main reason why we are at present", Kuqi said.
After the VPS battle, Honka is a key-jumbo, even with the latter TPS.
There are still seven rounds left in the Veika League, so there is still time for the most recent fall to the One.
I've never dropped a team before, and I'm not going to push it anymore.
We're not going to come out of this test", goalkeeper Vitala's threat.

Ice Bucket challenge from the participant to its legal location.
The British Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when he was wearing ice-cold water that he hurt his bones.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended so badly.
The woman has been taken care of since she yelled at Ice Bucket while doing her job so hard that she lost her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so loud when he was poured on ice cold water that he hurt the structure of his branch.
"The water was so hot that I was just screaming, but when I was screaming, I felt my jaw getting cold," he says to The .
Ice water is poured into 20 years old.
Isabelle Roberts takes a moment to send you a request.
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized that something was wrong.
My mother and my sisters hurt the same thing, and they laughed, but I had to say hi.
A 20-year-old British who participated in the most popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the jaw was set back to visit.
The video has become an Internet sensation, and it has been shared several times on the Facebook and on the Internet.
The angle of the wolf’s howling (even): How can a change of fan quantity change?
I mean, I was just being a real good-looking guy.
I saw a basketball player named Sakari Pehonen in 1997, when he had played for the Em final tournament against the King at the Athenian Marouss Ball Hall.
No, Pehonen was not exaggerating.
The game when you were there.
There are also so many Finnishs who called on 20,000 viewers to pull, in other words, to hear the noise.
I wonder what Pehonen would have done 19 years later after the World Championships in Finland.
In Bilbao, there are a hundred Finnish fans of troops forty times.
EM Games 1995 was the time to find the Finnish basketball game.
The men cut their way to the end of the tournament by winning, among other things, Russia in the fight at the February Library.
Its victory opened the doors to Europe’s world.
All right, bye-bye.
There were young people, like Hanna Mällä.
Headmaster Henrik Dettmann put Mölän in the final tournament team with the tabloids.
The solution many disagreed with.
Now it can be said that Dettmann was far from wise, even though not everything worked out according to the script.
After the Aprinciple, the basketball team dived into the deep pit.
In the Athenian race, Finns were informedly present over 100.
Among them were journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and some fans.
There are employees, relatives and trainers in Bilbao, but there are also fans there.
There's a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown in incomprehensible proportions.
I don't think anyone can understand the exact number of Finnish contestants.
Estimates have been moving between 7 500 and 10,000.
The number between the two is an incomprehensible number.
Here's an explanation for the sports fairs.
On a global scale, companies in the world are moving across borders.
There is still an opportunity for sport to know how we work internationally.
As mobility grows, we can see how we and our sons are living in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen of motion levelology.
There are Finns who are applying for a living in both both both the both at home and the football World Cup in Poland.
Common sense.
It still doesn't make sense.
The sport itself must also have the power to attract.
The Eastern Uplifts Sport in the Love of Life.
It is better to go to sports than to see art in Berlin.
Without success, the masses will still not be able to do so.
Let's go back to 1999.
At the time, head coach Dettmann challenged basketball court and also players to throw themselves in top sports professionally.
It took nearly five years to complete.
Then the move changed, and the national team action was raised to the ground.
The locals did the same thing before.
Now they're both seeing the job.
As East says, both modes have managed to produce their top sports, where the three-trinity works: sports-media-sponsors.
The audience is also interested in the audience.
And the media has taught us what such a carnal support is, Itkonnen lets you know.
Is it possible for the pools to transfer this massive interest to the domestic series as well?
On basketball and volleyball, the average game is for hundreds or over a thousand viewers.
I think it's a good question, and it's not necessarily a good answer that's going to be a good one for the species.
One of the schools believes in the transition of interest.
It's the one who doesn't want to be sweet all over his stomach.
This group is ready to go to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, they don't care about domestic stuff.

Fiber to save in manuscripts
The cost of college books in the United States crosses in the case of many students for $1,000, so soon Matt Schroeder, who started his second year of study, came up with a smart way of saving the cost.
He developed a system in which students from later years quote their books for a nominal remuneration instead of passing them forward immediately.
"My math book would normally have cost $180; I spent $10 on it for the whole month and a thousand sandwiches," says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studied at the Covent College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester book would normally have cost 430.
But he did 120.
According to the Management Board of the University, the average student spends more than 1,200 pounds on books and school food, but there are many ways at his disposal to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly finding creative approaches such as online transactions and the idea of Schroeder.
More and more students rent books so that they can use the book all the time and pay for it clearly less than they buy the book.
The rental of books has been doubled since 2011.
The statistical data in this field indicate that about one-quarter of the books of university bookshops last spring were rental books, reports Neebo President Trevor Meyer.
According to the National Association of College Stores, almost half of all books are collected from the National Association of College Stores.
Here are the simplest ways to save money.
Network trade
In online stores, you can only get one third of the price it would cost for a congress bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce International and Robert Hostetler's "Calculus" book is almost $2,90, but from the online trade in documents, the Chegg.com book is available at a price of $23,99.
Buy as long as you want.
Used books are a good option if the reader doesn't have any other notes and a worn-out look.
For example, "Calculus" can be obtained from the Chegg.com trade for $93,49.
Brigham Young University's last year of study Matt Casaday, six months, says that he bought a book "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding The Business End of The Advertising Business" from his Amazon.com transaction only at a rate of 0 %.
It would be 48.
The director of Amherst's College Without Walls University of Massachusetts, Ingrid Bracey and other institutions encourage students to ask their professors if the previous publications can be used for the course.
On occasion, new printing reports are not essential for the production of new prints.
In this case, old printing can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid again.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon bookshops, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Rent
If you take good care of them, remember to turn them back and do not need them for your course.
By renting, you can save more than 80% of the price of a new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the whole month costs about 20.
Please refer to the sale of the rental company, such as notes, the use of the emphasis pen and the cost of the subsequent payments.
The lessee, be careful: If you pay attention to this book, the delay may be more than just the book purchase price.
E-mails
Making e-books instead of ordinary paper can also be an issue.
These books are to be rented, whereby the right to use an e-book is paid to the holder, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc., for example.
The Chegg store receives the e-book "Calculus" for a month for about 61 dollars.
According to Bracey, many books are sustainable, because many classes can now be downloaded for free, while science and technology books can be very expensive.
The comparison of different sellers is in favour of what I choose.

In fires, the second double the number of people in the last month.
This year, there will be a nearly double number of people in the fires last year.
According to the media monitoring of the Finnish Civil Protection Organization (Spek), up to now, 55 people have already died in 49 different fires.
In the same time last year, fire deaths were 31.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
The age of 65 has been 11.
According to multiple fire deaths, the worst situation was the last year in 2009, when by the end of August there were 64 people in the fires.
The vast majority of fire deaths occur in housing.
17 fire deaths have occurred in the floors, 21 in the domestic houses, and 7 in the row and other small houses.
Pek reminds me of the resuscitation of fire safety in the home.
At least the operation of all home fire extinguishers should be ensured according to the rules.
In addition, it should be checked that the initial adjustment devices are readily available.
All the premises of the home must also have an accessible exit route.
The child should also be told what electrical equipment they use at home.

Rough rainfalls reached Malmö and Copenhagen to the flood of Malmö and Copenhagen.
The streets flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen, when the heavy rains struck South Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters broke up several times, mixed up the traffic and buried the cars again.
As a result, the authorities estimate that it may be long before the flood slows down, even though the rains were predicted to cease on Monday.
Hard rains came to surprise the Swedish authorities, and no weather warnings were given about the rains.
On-call meteorologist Ari Mälla of the Finnish Academy of Weather Sciences estimates that the rainfall in the area affected by rainfall was very local.
The rain range appears to be narrow and still stable.
No, it's not, if it's been hard to make sense.
The French Socialists should "be quiet and help France", says the main supporter of Francois Hollande.
Mr. Valls strongly urged the Left to "show his feelings" to a socialist president in difficulty, whose new government did not have the majority approval.
He deserves all due respect, he deserves our rights, our support.
"Our mission is to live alongside him," Valls said and deserved to be praised.
The Prime Minister of Economic Affairs, in spite of the 35-hour working week in the French debate in which the French Minister of Economic Affairs Emmanuel Macron gave the floor this week, insists that the debate should be held.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Mr Christiane Tabira, called on the Socialist Peoples who had expressed different opinions at the end of the debate to meet the Socialist peoples who had expressed their views and denied the Socialist Party that it would allow "France to give up hope for the future".
Marine Le Pen, the president of the National Front of the Irregisce, took pride in the constant disunity of the socialists and said that I do not believe in the new world of Valls for any longer than this year.
Mr. Francois Hollande has probably gone to war, but also Mr. Manuel Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after he was unable to last even for the summer.
"The new plant will not last until winter or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal to break up the parliament and held his party's political victory in the early elections, and he himself would be ready to lead the party.

Pokka cheating on Finland's conductors Kirsi Alm-Siran, Nina Rahkola and the meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka was badly deceived by the role played by the show.
The Finland program was working on a website last Thursday on the fun video on Thursday.
The directors Kirsi Alm-Sira and Nina Rahhola, as well as the meteorologist Pekka Pouta, try to record the Finnish advertising buffer from the next day's broadcast, but the recording does not go well.
Alm-Sira goes crazy in his speech when he tries to speak the word 'sufficient', and his confusion also gets Pouda and Rahkola to play the poker all the time after each other.
And these are the ones that should be allowed to make a live broadcast tomorrow, the World's Facebook Amendment point.
The video has become very popular and has both been and is full of more than 10 000.

Räitö: The Aarnio investigation has already cost more than EUR 5 million.
Over EUR 5 million has already been paid to investigate the lawfulness of the activities of the police unit and has required 30 to 50 years of staff.
This is how Jri Rajamäki evaluated Jyväskylä's information work for the University of Jyväsky in his work on the thesis.
The Commission proposes that police action in general could be improved through the combination of investigation and judicial information systems to improve law enforcement and the fight against crime.
Under this framework, modern technology enables the use of criminal material to be multiplicated.
It notes that it is possible to establish a system where the information to be collected to investigate the crime is automatically evidence of electronic evidence that fills the chain of evidence and, at the same time, enables comprehensive law enforcement.
It's a fight on Tuesday.
Yle: The 1999 concept of vegetable food forgot about school at the school: "Fish and chicken dishes from Kasvisdi".
A picture of the special information about the school’s nowhere in the world about the curfew in public media, says Yle on its website.
Vegetarians!
At a vested lunch, there are fish and chicken dishes.
Only if there is meat on the side will we prepare a vegetable option.
In this way, in a forgotten 15-year-old bulletin, the school was found to be in the school's school.
I'll take a look at you here.
A picture of the social media has been sent by people to Pirkkala to send angry feedback to the government of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of the Food and Cleaning Service, tells Yle that the forgotten note is not true and should have been long overdue.
Apparently, before I come, I've never had an idea that's been discussed with someone in time.
The student gets the right meal, he says to Yle.
Today, students at Pirkkaa School are offered a vegetarian option only with the permission of their parents and a certificate from a nurse or nurse on a vegetarian diet.
The danger justifies the solution to the above because young food experiments may leave nutrition to the needs of people and the absence of meat or chicken may make them wonder the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise close to the 3 billion-dollar Prestige Cruise Agreement.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, negotiates for sale to its competitor, Prestige Cruises International In, for three billion dollars.
The Norwegian Cruise company, which has a market value of USD 6.8, operates the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of the Prestige Cruises company against the more competitive Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (Rcl.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
Sources indicate that information on the possible issue is already being discussed at this stage, although it is also possible that negotiations will not result.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want to be made public because negotiations were not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not reply to their comments and Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise, operating in the region of Miami, has 13 cruise ships covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Mediterranean.
Its turnover was 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when its turnover was 2.77 per cent.
Prestige Cruises, which operates on all of them, sail with the Oceania and Regent brand, which includes a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was 1.2 percentage points, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The 29 billion-dollar cruise market is expected to emerge in the coming years from emerging economies, such as the average classes of India and India.
In order to become the first option for these new customers, the companies compete when choosing a cruise.
Prestige Cruises takes over the first share of the United States share market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company's shares in 2007 after a trade worth 850 million dollars.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in its current composition in 2000 with its combined Geting Bh (GENT.KL) cruise company. The latter is the entertainment and entertainment company of Malaysian Prime Minister Lim Kok Tay.
Apollo invested billions of dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise registered as a public company in January 2013.
According to published data, the share of Genting of the company was 28%, Apollo 20%, and the share of TPG Capital LP 8% at the end of June.
The combined total of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises is 82% of North American cruise products, as shown in the identification document published by Prestige Cruise in connection with the formation of shares in Prestige Cruise.
The President of the Council is currently discussing this matter today.
Animalia wishes the Government to start supporting the firm.
According to the Executive Director of Animalia, Salla Tuomivaara, who prepares the thesis for the University of Tampere, during the dolphins in Finland and around the world, it is urgent to begin immediately.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, it has become more common to say that the presence of highly developed mammals such as dolphins in dolphins is neither a protection nor ethically viable.
The Commission's proposal is based on a proposal from the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
The termination of the Delphi is not only a matter of protection, but also a question of visual tourism, the Judge points out.
According to the import risk, the death of Näsi-delphin determines the requirements for the Delphinary Deployment.
I see it's sad to go to the darkest history of the Säkänäinen dolphin.
It's time to die at a point, shut down the dolphins and find out how to move the English dolphins to a limited sea area, a sort of dolphin shelter, Tuomivara requires.
The eyes didn't see the return of the dolphins to their original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Viper are still experiencing more than a live-in concrete, Tuomivaara wishes.
The aim of the Code of Conduct for Animal Health is to prevent all wild animals from being used in circuses in the context of the overall reform of the animal law in preparation.
There are also dolphins.
In support of this claim, the Animalia Executive Board is taking part in today 1.9.
In the spirit of the domestic embassy in Helsinki, the protest against the dolphin hunting season in Japan is held.
During the period of the hunting, approximately 2300 dolphins, either for the use of dolphins or for the use of food, are tried or killed every year.
I called on Kiev to open negotiations on a new state with the East.
Russian President Vladimir Putin called for the Ukrainian government to fight against separatists in the eastern part of the country and to begin negotiations immediately on the "state" of the region of origin, the Russian sources of news say.
His representative, Mr. Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Mr. Putin did not mean that the Eastern Ukraine, under Separatist rule, would become part of the Union, but that it would need to be reconsidered at the moment to allow the Russian-speaking population to defend their rights and interests.
The request made by Putin to the Kiev Government for negotiations on the Russian-minded uprisings in a balanced way corresponds to his obvious strategy, which he has taken since the violence began ten years ago: he is trying to help separatists to take over the territory and thus to force the Ukrainian will in practice to give the proclamation of independence, which will enable him to move to the West instead of the West.
In an interview with the State Kanava 1 TV channel, Putin condemned Ukraine's army's efforts to regain the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk area, controlled by the Separatist Separatist, which were invaded by the Separatists in March and September by Moscow following the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula itself on 18th March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently baptized the region as "Novossija", "New Great Britain" – this term marks the days of the great revolutions of the Russian power.
According to Itar-Tass, the Russian news agency, Putin, said that the peace talks are 'movement' as long as the Ukrainian politicians are running campaigns for parliamentary elections on 26 October and they are attacking civilians in areas under separatist control.
"We need to start wide-ranging negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and the position of the South-Eastern Empire.
According to Pesov, the Putin's call for "statehood" is linked to the greatest independence that has been discussed with Kiev in its attempt to remove the fears of Russian peoples that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
The government of Ukraine can only give the Eastern region the most independence they need, says Peskov.
The issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, says Peskov, "because it is not a conflict between Ukraine and Ukraine, it is an internal conflict within Ukraine".
The interim note by the Kreml representative, which was intended to correct Putin's comments on the 'false interpretation', stressed that the Russian government is handling the Separatist rebellion in the eastern regions in a different way from the one in Rim, when, in reality, it occupied an area where the majority of the population of 2 people is ethnically weak.
It would be much easier for Moscow to connect even the areas of Donetsk or Luhansk in the East, as most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically weak and, according to previous opinions, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence on which the Russians are at the heart of international fora would allow Ukrainian local governments to agree on their own trade agreements and relations, which would give the Kremlin, in practice, power in an area that links the United States to the Crimea.
In the Black Sea peninsula, which was connected to Russia five months ago, the main Russian fleet is located, as well as the port areas of commercial sea and historical locations.
In the area between Russia Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal melting plants that produce vital products for the environment.
President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, proposed, in his post, on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislators – after a new election – will consider changes to the Constitution in order to make decisions on their own economy and their own language status in areas outside the core of Ukraine.
However, its vision of independence seems to differ sharply from that of the armed and sedated separatists of the Kreml and Moscow.
Putin's latest request to the Government of Kiev to negotiate with the Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels went further after the invasion of the tanks and troops in the Eastern region of the formerly free zone on the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that the takeover of the city of Novoazowski by supporting the support of the Separatist Separatist city is the beginning of a major effort aimed at reaching the entire region of the region until the Crimean border.
It has been developed to strengthen the city of Mariupo by a massive civilian and military staff. Half a million inhabitants of Mariupol are known as the steel-rich city, which is situated between the narrow land of Novozovsk and the Crimean peninsula.
This morning, he spoke to the leaders of the European Union, asking for further action to be taken to prevent future violations in Ukraine, the former Republic of the Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We're about to get to a point that doesn't come back," the Põroshenko warned.
In the region of the Ukraine, there are now new foreign countries and tanks.
The EU Summit did not take any decisions on direct action; it did work to create additional sanctions to enable them to be introduced if the crisis in Ukraine re-emphasises in unclear circumstances.
Ukraine's soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in the Ilovaiski region after two Russian armed forces and 1 000 people were moved to Donetsk last year in order to resolve the difficulties of separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, told journalists in Kiev as a refuge.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be deployed in Ilovaisk in Russia were replaced by 10 Russian launches, which were sent to the Ukraine a short time ago.
