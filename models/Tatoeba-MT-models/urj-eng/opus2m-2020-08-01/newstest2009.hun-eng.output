At the end of the trade, the Prague stock exchange was forgotten at the end of the trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange repaired its losses after the morning crash.
Transactions in shares in the CEE (REZ) amounted to nearly half of the ordinary daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange immediately continued its fall from the start of Tuesday’s trade, when it fell by almost six percent on Monday.
This time, the fall in the shares of Wall Street is behind the fall.
This is how the market response to the vote of the American Parliament has shown us, which rejected the support for the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Pedestrian shares in Asia.
On the Asian stock exchanges, the dramatic fall of the shares took place on Tuesday, although the indicators during the day were cancelled some part of the losses were cancelled at the end of the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng Exchange Index described almost four percent during the trading period, but subsequently deleted part of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell by 3.8 per cent and the markets were closed in Shanghai.
The shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but in the end the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock exchange there, according to the index, fell by 3.6 per cent.
"The timing of the US rescue action is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," notes Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Board.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, determines its own money, i.e. regardless of the central bank in China.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the U.S. legislators should start negotiations immediately and accept the financial system support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries will be threatened by the consequences of this.
The bloodbath of U.S. shares is a bloodbath of U.S. shares.
On Monday, the U.S. Parliament rejected the draft financial system support, to which USD 700 billion (up to a maximum of 12 billion) should have been translated.
The legislators thus rejected President George Bush's invitation to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, the U.S. stock passed a bath and the leading stock indices registered the biggest crash in 20 years.
Aow-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw-Aw, fell by almost seven percent, with a similar decrease last time in 1987.
The index was before the vote, but as it turned out, the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index was released.
Congress resigned: The U.S. government can thus pump USD 700 billion into banks.
The U.S. Chief Executives and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the American financial system.
This will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
In the negotiations for the approval of an emergency plan, American legislators have reached a breakthrough in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in the form of an amount of USD 700 billion (approximately EUR 12 billion) in the form of financial assistance.
But there is no victory yet.
Congress must complete some of the details of the agreement before they can make public the final form and vote of the law.
The financial system's payment schedule will be examined at the Assembly on Monday.
He briefed Reuters on this matter on behalf of Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Financial Organisations, on behalf of the Reuters News Agency.
According to the Senate, the draft may be voted on Wednesday as soon as possible.
It should be reported that the rescue plan is approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, "judgment" will be carried out afterwards.
Paulson: The plan should be effective.
"We have taken a great step.
We have resolved our different views on the form of a package to stabilise the market," said the Bloomberg Agency's Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
According to him, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
The legislator's representatives met Henry Paulson, the US Minister of Finance, on the night of the night, to give the government the final form.
This should be the case for the acquisition by financial companies of the irresponsible mortgage activity, which causes financial companies to lose serious losses and threatens the stability of the entire system.
"We are in the final agreement on a draft which will work and which should be effective on the market at the same time.
The improvement draft still needs to be continued, but I think we're there," Paulson said.
Signage of Asian trading
The global financial crisis has a major impact on commodity markets, which are falling rapidly.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the legislators are therefore seeking to reach an end-of-day agreement in the United States of America.
In fact, he is able to reassure investors before the start of trade in Asian money markets, where, from the time zone, the decision of the Region could first affect the trade on Monday.
It is not clear yet, however, when two chambers of the US Congress vote on the law, as is the case, whether the trial should not end at the last moment due to a problem.
The creators hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still undergoes many changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
At the request of President Bush, the first USD 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may waive the amount of the remaining amount, which was set at USD 100 billion and subsequently at USD 350 billion if it feels that the programme is failing to fulfil its function.
Bush assessed the progress made in the negotiations.
While the President may defend this decision, the Conference may re-examine its pendulum.
However, despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme, which was the acquisition of financial assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, remains, as hundreds of Americans are unable to pay off their mortgage loans.
"We've worked everything out.
The House should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress made in the progress made in the negotiations.
Mr Fratto, President Bush's spokesperson, stated that the president was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the two-party efforts made to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of bus termination payments.
Mr Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, on the protection of taxpayers from losses, on the closure of benefits and on the timing of the draft financing.
The new law also restricts the so-called busic termination payments of directors participating in the programme and establishes a board of supervisors.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance to houseowners who have problems with the payment.
In the case of mortgages that the government has acquired, the government should submit new write-offs with a view to reducing the monthly write-offs of debtors and allowing them to retain their houses.
Mark: Spiritual aid.
The proposed draft David Marek, head of Patria Finance, says it's a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"That's because you can't know what kind of mechanism and price they're buying problem active substances.
This will determine how the financial sector and government share losses among themselves," said Marek of the IHNed.cz site this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now, or next week at the beginning of next week.
"The more important thing is that the congress is due this week to support the plan and, as far as possible, give their blessing.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement to approve the plan is the most important thing right now," said Marek.
A couple on the platform: MP3 player mobiles.
We will help you choose how to choose.
While all mobiles are capable of playing MP3 files, no MP3 player can be called.
Clearly, it seems that it is better to buy just a phone.
However, there are many reasons why a person can acquire a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the way in which it is used and the future owner's name.
It is unlikely that it will be difficult to get a high-end high-end high-end record player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on the bakery plates, but there is no objective reason, qualitatively, for this reason.
However, if the shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues with bag media, it is likely to be made of such a disk player.
This is similar to the travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
Here too there are price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely to be able to accept a 20 crown market listener.
Two extremities, each of which has plenty of space.
The choice is wide.
The lifetime of the elements is also a matter of life.
A music player of some high quality can do much more than just play music, but also what most mobiles can do by accident.
No device now exists as universal as the phone.
In addition to the main functions, phone calls and text messages, you can play music and video, each of them on record, you have a better-less camera in it, you can even navigate it.
And if we take into account smartphones and communicators, he'll have a small computer in his pocket.
It's a little bit of a miracle, because no refrigerator can score and no television can take pictures.
Several functional mobiles have a disadvantage, however, as well.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy breakers in the world.
Low level of mobile devices to play digital music for a period of more than ten to twelve hours, mostly it is much less than that for a period of 10 to 12 hours.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more effective than the music players.
That's why cheap cell phones don't play you for more than a few hours.
In addition, if you are on the phone here and there, get another charger for your job, just in case - this also applies to more expensive equipment.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even worse players will endure at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a charge.
The next problem arises when the music is uploaded to the mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
In fact, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope without a adapter with the miniature memory cards used on mobile phones.
You do not need to have any additional iPod (iPod) features for your player.
Stop loading the device from the computer with music through the USB.
The majority of mobiles and players themselves are already creating a music library in order based on the name of the performer, the album, the genre or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices represent only a structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, players know more about mobiles.
The choice of the specific equipment should be followed primarily for battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output, and, of course, for ease of treatment.
If your music is primarily based on you and listens to the electricity for a short time a day, for example, any MP3 player may be suitable for you.
And this is really something that we can do now.
You don't have to pay particular attention to what musical formats the mobile or player knows.
Each MP3 will cope with each and the crucial majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
MP3 is among the most common, and the vast majority of devices can cope with WMA-like music.
AAC (the format used by and for the last time by the Apple) is no longer available.
Right mobiles also allow, for example, on-line music shopping.
Enough mobile internet to visit the relevant pages of the service provider (or other service provider) and buy the song or album.
This service itself can be a strong argument for obtaining music music music.
Unfortunately, the provision of services by operators is disgusting and usually limited to single-hull radio sign.
Price is not the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that the music will control the music industry in the future (either through GSM, Internet or wireless internet).
Most people keep keeping their mobiles on themselves.
Any time you want to listen to something, your cell phone will tap out in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether or not you still carry the earphones or at least the speakers.
If not, you can use the external speaker to which almost all mobile but only a few MP3 players have access.
Many people are likely to have the greatest advantage of music mobiles in terms of price.
The cheapest ones are usually less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can already obtain a fair walkman.
However, you are mostly limited by the lack of the output of the traditional listener.
The best and most technically equipped telephones may be sent to fifteen thousand crowns with traditional earphones with a diameter of 3.5 mm.
The advantage of players, however, is simple to treat, among other things, the advantage of players.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily by managing the cheapest players (see our choice), everyone really copes with it.
Minimum function, a treatment similar to that of a previous standard castration tape or a grofone is apparent.
There will be no collapse in the form of accidentally activated mobile internet, nor will there be a huge bill following the transmission of data.
We're going to choose a tool. We're going to choose a device.
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have access to interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
The maximum number of 2,000 crowns can be used to obtain the right card.
But be careful, though.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB or less.
Only the most expensive can do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Cse, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irver.
On the basis of the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not need to spend more than 1 100 young people on the basis of your capacity.
If you belong to a more demanding student, choose a special mobile walkman (Sony-Hson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control key, so the ease of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson was the most advanced, which has the same user interface as the separate MP3 players sold on Walkman’s serial mobiles.
The above brands MP3 can provide the same same service in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (up to 15 hours on average, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Like
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our suppliers offer practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, there is something we need here - a virtual service provider that imposes significant price reductions on classic service providers.
Well, maybe it won't last long.
On Mobil.cz, we have often written that Czech operators in Europe are among the most expensive in the world.
This was confirmed by the ESC, which drew attention to the fact that the prices of text messages are more expensive in the rest of the Union.
Following the Commission's last step in regulating roaming charges, there may be a conflicting situation - Czech mobile operators' text messages from some customers from abroad will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that Czech prices are so high in comparison to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that wants to get into a real fight.
This may be inconsistent, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is very 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are willing to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed with Pavel Dvo Najak, President of the Council of the Community Communications Office, who has recently said that there is no room for another service provider in the future.
It may be true that the classic service provider is likely to have too much potential with its own network (almost likely to find frequency).
However, there is another option - the virtual service provider.
The introduction of the virtual service providers' mobile market brought a significant price reduction, which the classic service providers had to respond to afterwards.
In addition, even before entering the big fish market, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, there were sound similar to their own.
However, it has been proven that such service providers have seats and that they can indeed succeed.
You don't have to go too far, for example.
This February, we informed you about the start of the Mobilking virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider has not managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers in the last six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, the Penta Financial Group is behind the Mobile, which is the owner of the U:fon, other than the U:fon, which is also the owner of the Mobile.
The benefits of virtual service providers are the possibility of focusing on a much smaller target group.
Effective operation requires far less customers than the traditional service provider.
In fact, it does not involve relatively high building, mobile and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world are thus generally low-cost - offering cheap calls and text messages, which, however, are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
However, as shown by the example of the Polish Bank, it can be quite a drag to be placed on a target group like that.
This service provider focuses particularly on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking service provider - who they like, who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company operating this virtual service provider.
It is not possible to know if we have a similar idea to that of Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson of Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small in terms of the segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, the supply of services is relatively satisfactory."
Probably unlikely, creating mobile service providers.
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the future, it will not be Mobile.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but in the second, the negotiations do not seem to be too much hopeful.
The mobile will be launched in other countries of our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the Penta Financial Group in a phone interview with Mobil.cz.
Indirectly, it was established that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic were not very related to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to prevent any potential competition from arising.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has been keeping its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider, which requires another step in order to ensure that Telephone O2 becomes a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested in the fact that we can offer our customers not only wireless but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner the better, the better, the better.
This possibility will be discussed again with all Czech mobile service providers.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, the group spokesperson.
Maybe now is a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual service provider can be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is surrounded by the wall of impenetrable silence for the time being.
"At this moment, we do not think that a full virtual service provider would be a place in the Czech market.
Unlike the rest of the market, the Czech market is very special.
So far, he has not spoken to us by a single software offering a complex and serious project in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about Vlastimil Sršeè, Telefhonica 02 press.
Other operators are also referring to the situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrová, the spokesperson of T-Mobile, with the exception of O2, added: "We have not yet recorded any viable and bilaterally advantageous business project to which we can rely."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year , it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up.
Right now, we should have a specific agreement on our table so that we can change in such a short term."
Vodafone is more focused on meeting its own 3G licensing requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are here to negotiate with potential virtual service providers, in particular in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most affordable from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partnership for the establishment of networks shared with high-speed mobile communications."
Responsible offices - a string with service providers.
The process of mobile service providers is easy to understand, the involvement of another service provider would lead to an increase in competition, a fall in prices and thus a fall in their profits.
So why make it easier for us to enter such a competition?
When service providers have something important, they are able to cooperate, as well as witness to the Hosefang around the birth of U:fon.
The greatest pressure on ČTú was likely to be on the birth of the U-fed of T-Mobile Company.
This information is available on the website of the CZECH REPUBLIC.
But right now, the U:fon would like a good argument that the virtual service provider's access should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by the access to the fourth mobile market.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is clear that the entry of another player would impose high requirements on the market and its services."
However, given the attitude of mobile operators such as this, the complete failure of Czech regulatory bodies is absolutely amazing.
Meanwhile, it is not just the attitude of the ČTÖ, in which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, you have no right to intervene in economic competition.
As such, only the Economic and Social Committee is entitled to do so.
However, the Office has a specific relation to the whole problem.
"The entry into the mobile market of a virtual service provider would only be possible after the conclusion of the contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider for renting the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded since the offer of potential entrants was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," said Kristián Chápua, of the External Relations Department of the Economic Market, in response to our question.
A statement thus written by the representatives of the operators would probably not surprise anyone.
However, the authority which should represent the interests of consumers and, in addition, ensure that no one can recover from their market situation is more than strange.
Especially if Kristián Chaulu adds: "Outland, where virtual service providers generally operate, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephone services."
However, it is likely that the OHS' interests do not include pressure to ensure the proper functioning of the market environment and to reduce prices.
In such a case, the truly shocking reaction of the three mobile operators is a fairly visible consistency.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence, it's almost self-evident?
As at the charging stations, the same gas prices must be the result of random and hard competition.
"The Office in this case did not detect the effects of the anti-competitive proceedings, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers have a leading position, i.e. they have a correspondingly greater responsibility for their market operations.
The tools necessary to open the mobile market for virtual operators are likely to be missing by the telecommunications regulator," Chalu said.
One of the many points in the debate is the presentation of the market leadership situation.
There is a real analysis of the relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ, on the basis of which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, after that market, no Czech operator is in a position to lead the situation.
However, some legal experts have other views - it is always necessary for the virtual service provider to be approved by the network operator.
And the mobile service provider has a monopoly on its own network, relatively logically.
They are therefore necessarily dominant in a certain segment.
But even if we did not accept this argument, the minimum incentive for OHOHS should be that three mobile operators act in a similar way.
Complaints by interested parties (including the already mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they face very similar barriers to the negotiation of all suppliers during negotiations.
The transfer of responsibility to CZKU is a relatively normal exercise in telecommunications, which UOHS takes his hands off the whole case.
There have been a number of similar situations in the past.
In the text of the recent telecommunications law, the extension of the powers of ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications could not be passed, although many experts were hoping to improve the situation.
This is something that representatives of the U.S.A. need to know well, but it's probably different in their interests.
This works when no one watches.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of virtual service providers, many of which already operate on Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own mobile phone service prices, but they are only partially public.
This is a multilevel marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The prices of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The confidence lies in the fact that the company is acting as a traditional customer against the provider, which orders a large number of SIM cards.
You will receive special offers (and other discounts) as a special customer.
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators are prohibiting the same provision.
"If there were any cases that he was talking about, there could be a breach of contract terms that we would deal with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with that company," Martina Kemrová answered our question about this problem.
However, it is unlikely that reports of this kind of activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, thousands of customers may be involved in the three companies mentioned.
In the meantime, no service provider will defend against such a procedure.
They have no negligible profits in the activities of these companies and, unlike the actual virtual service providers, they do not in particular threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not appear on their phone on their name, so this cannot be fully provided as general customers of mobile operators."
But at least that's what the ESC should be saying.
In addition, another question arises for the OHOHS.
If mobile operators fail to act in a similar way, why prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively strong powers to disclose such activities, and, if you do not want to, you do not need to be satisfied with the justification of the service providers that nothing was suspected and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we don't become the most expensive of all.
As has already been said in the text, the access of virtual operators to the mobile market has led to an appreciable drop in the prices of services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual service providers are formed, regular service providers have tried more or less to prevent them from being created.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the developed countries, at this very moment, regulatory bodies have been involved, which certainly did not protect the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then, either by formal measures or by informal pressure, the creation of the first virtual service provider, which others have done, was achieved by the creation of the first virtual service provider.
Unfortunately, Czech regulatory bodies are giving each other the whole thing.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really soon to appear, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one operator would allow a virtual mobile service provider to operate, the OHOHS will only be able to be indifferent to the rejection of other interested parties (discrimination).
And for the rest of Europe, we may not be making any more expensive calls.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best one. Choose the best one.
Please observe the four processes of the new version of the Czech State Himmnus.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mik Topolá, on the day of the United States of America, solemnly presented the new recordings of the state hymn of my country.
The hymnus was recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the leadership of Ji -í B -lohláváv Ji - Ji -í B -lohláváv.
There are four versions available - with male or female solos, choirs or interoperability.
Katerina Knížková and Adam Plachetka sings.
Author of the amendment of the hymn by Okakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Krček.
All four versions of iHNed.cz can be listened to on the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national story is considered one of the most beautiful hymns in the Czech Republic.
He told this Radio earlier that he had chosen representative singers, who were prominent and popular, who were deliberately young, for the performance of the solo variations.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care of both of them and later the orchestra for the clear division, the clarity and consistency of the text," he said.
The Czech state hymn will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song was first recorded in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 by Josef Kaijetan Tyl Fidlováčka in his play, along with the music of František Škroup.
He became popular and was considered spontaneously to be their own people.
And the first season of the song became a natural part of the state hymn after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the development of the Republic of Estonia, the seven national symbols remained one of the seven national symbols.
What's a "new" hymnus like
The Persian transport company first delivers chips on Wednesdays.
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, you enter the history of the Prague Transport Company as the first passenger to enter the subway, tram and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available in about a thousand people holding the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day and an annual coupon (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save on their chips in the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at the Museum, Mgtstek, Nádraží Holokovice, Andi, Roztyly, Letîany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons are already online from yesterday via the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers up to the afternoon hours.
Those who start using online trading may permanently forget to rent train stations, where they have so far had to make a long series of calls for tickets on a regular basis.
The coupon can be purchased via the internet and also on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a bar with trained service providers who help visitors to purchase online and save our purchased coupon on their cards," said Martin Opatrný, the speaker of the project.
Besides libraries, electronic coupons can be saved to Opencard in some of the self-service machines provided in the halls.
How do these automatics look?
Reds, they remind me of the ticketers, and the passengers may have noticed them at train stations in Roztyly, Budjjovick, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in the city, but there should be 80 by the end of the year," said Opatrný.
The coupon on the driver's side is automatically checked by the driver instead of by an automatic checker.
It will be easy to operate their operations tomorrow with the initial automatics.
There is only enough time to enter the Opencard chip card and the coupon paid in advance will be cancelled by itself.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital but also in the capital.
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, which are mainly used by people travelling to the capital of the city of Central Czech.
"In the trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, the drivers were provided with card readers to determine the zone validity of the coupons," explained Ropid, who compared the timetable for public transport in Prague, to the control of the lines with Dra Filip Draal.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the cashier at the manager's office.
The driver should therefore not only show the chip card on the way in, but also place Opencard in the place specified on the website of the office.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if a passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the simplest thing to ask the driver to do is to do so," Dra added.
Passengers who do not drive buses around the city and who will not remember when their coupon expires will be able to return to self-service machines that save coupons from cards.
Information on the validity of their documents will appear here on the display of the device.
The Soviets wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945 the Sudeten Germans were requested to be attached to the United States of America in Shumava.
This is found in the letter that is in the collection of the Central Library of South Czechs.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the US cartridge.
It is said that in 1945 some groups of Swedish Germans from Sudeten turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is also evident from a letter from a private archive, which is now stored in the collection of the National Library of South Czechs.
The Germans in Česky Krudlov, in the letter, are asking the President of the United States not to allow the re-departure of the "shumak county" to the Czech Republic, which has yet to be taken over under the Munich Treaty.
"We have interpreted the situation correctly and we really want to be sure of the words that the American troops will certainly not arrive in the German territories as a repellent and enemy, but as a liberator," is in the letter, "the people who bear the fate of Shumava in their hearts".
Since a connection to Slovakia is supposed to be possible for the Sudeten Germans - with the knowledge of the Czech national character - only to hope for brutality, mercy, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the author asks the President of the United States of America to take over the protection "now and forever".
"We do not know that, regardless of the opinions of four million people, this area would be considered to be a foreign country that would suppress and upset the minority and would not contribute anything to the ally's victory," says the letter.
The reason why the authors could not sign is that it is a fear of the desire of the "cah repression".
Therefore, if the President of the United States were to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Shaumaa, it would be sufficient to hold a referendum in the village of Shaumaa on whether its residents wish to become a part of the United States and wish to live under the protection of the United States of America.
Although the text of the letter may seem naïve to current knowledge of post-war history, some historians say that it adequately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to have had some doubts that they would be deported from the country, only a few of them were aware of this possibility.
Some people expected the United States and the Great Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudetens.
Others trusted that they would simply remain in Slovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chaluva, an Austrian journalist born in České Budjív, Austria.
During the war, Chalu was serving at the Baltic Sea as a German Budjovici in the Baltic Sea.
At the end of the war, when the British arrested him and put him in prison camp in Hostynsko, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them in Czech.
"They trusted that when they came back, they could use the Czech language," Chalu said.
According to German prisoners living in Slovakia before the war, none of them counted that they were deported from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You're not thinking - you're paying.
The sentimental campaign attacks the leader.
In Czech history, the most expensive action to be taken on road safety is in Czech history.
The media campaign on emotions, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday, would thus be characteristic.
Ministerial Office of Aleš ←ebíček hopes that this campaign will deter leaders from taking dangerous action behind the government.
The 150 million will be included in television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
Leaders should be alarmed by speed and alcohol.
And they should also be reminded of the fact that their seat belts are to be fastened before they leave.
Above all, young drivers, motorbikes, pedestrians and not least professional drivers want to have a conscience.
And what will appear in the ads?
They're all human stories attacking emotions.
This is also witnessed by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You're not thinking - you're paying.
The term "non-Thinking" on the plate is written in capital letters on the plate number.
And the vertebrae has the word "tax" in it.
This should represent the possibility of paying a person's life for a sudden lack of attention.
The viewers will be "feared" by the advertisements until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the UK countries, where dramatic images of victims of accidents are regularly viewed.
It is hoped that this will lead to a reduction in the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The advertisements were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, clean it up for drivers.
The system of "driving the driver" is in place.
"Let them know" is when they, for example, cross the wheel and save time.
"Draw it" is the danger of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk," says Martin Koa, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist thinks.
According to him, the driver's attention to the warning signs is less effective.
"If the hazard warning board is equipped, it is likely to blend with the environment soon and the leaders will not deal with it," warned Koián.
Olmert almost all of the occupied areas would be returned in exchange for the exchange.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke of the resumption of virtually all areas occupied in 1967, namely Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highlands, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview that he published on Monday with the Jedi Achron on a daily basis.
"We need to agree with the Palestinians, which means that it's almost irrelevant if we don't have to return all of the areas (reported) back," Olmer said to the newspaper.
"We will give a certain percentage of this area, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include my East Jerusalem.
"Who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his feet as he did with one of my best friends, he must give up part of Paul's life," says Olmert, referring to an attack on two July cities in which a few people were killed and injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution to the Temple Mountain, sacred and historical places" in Old Town.
"The one who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the whole city must integrate 20,000 Arabs.
This is not going to work," he stressed.
The exit from the Golan plateau is a step off the Golan plateau.
He also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan plateau, which, according to him, is an essential condition for the Treaty with Syria.
However, this would require a certain effort from Damascus as well.
"I do not recommend a confidentiality with Syria only on the basis of the exit from Golan," he warned me.
"The midwives well know what they have to cancel so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (shit movement); they must give up the regular support provided to the terrorism of Hamász (sit movement), Al-Qaida and Jihad (sacred war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister stated.
Questions after an accident: Is passengers in buses illegal?
The law does not know them, they are not allowed to travel in a long distance bus.
In connection with the tragic bus accident of the company Agency, the question raised near the Italian Padua was whether passengers and passengers could travel in the bus during the journey.
"If we are to comply strictly and formally with the law, the passenger's activities conflict with the law on transport," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a twenty-two-year-old passenger is likely to result in the driver of a truck crossing the bus road.
The misfortune of her daughter was currently sitting next to the driver, in the bus in the least safe place, even though she had two more seats reserved for her.
The bus can either run into a contact or suddenly run into a stop at the moment when the passenger offers coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a key to whether or not the bus has a licence to drive a bus.
If the bus is not homologized, passengers should be seated.
There are no long-distance buses for Agency; this is confirmed by Radim Jančura, the company's manager, Aktúlj.cz.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this has been withdrawn, and we have found that passengers can go to the toilet during the journey if they have their own seat," he said.
The law does not know the passenger passenger.
"There is no clear legal framework for the role of the passenger - no legislation governs this position.
However, the importer does not have any legislation prohibiting the provision of services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a driver; it does not define rights and obligations," added Hanzelka spokesperson.
Mr Pokorný, Director of the Department of Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, considers that the law manages the problem properly.
"It depends on whether or not it is in your bus's license.
It's over," you say.
Buses can be considered to be urban areas where they are located and are limited in maximum speed and in places between cities and at higher speeds and distances without distances and with seats with maximum speed and seat belts allowed.
As on the plane, says the expert.
Jaroslav Ho, BESIP’s Road Safety Expert, does not see any fundamental problem on board the bus in the presence of passengers.
"In the course of progress there is no danger, the situation can be compared to the provision of the aircraft.
You're not even sure when there's a stopover and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"But if the bus suddenly brakes, its physical laws will, of course, be in force.
The same as in city buses or shops.
Passenger safety must be resolved by internal rules of the carrier," he says, and he also believes that the problem of law has not been resolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel services.
As the only bus carrier in the Agency, it offers passenger services as a passenger service.
Two hundred passengers are employed.
The Director will not take any chances after the accident.
"But as I'm going to have the impression that the work of a passenger is dangerous, I'm going to end it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers when boarding.
It would cost you," he says.
In its vehicles, it was justified on the grounds of safety interests that passenger deficiencies were caused by Alexej Litvin, the Director of Asia, who operates a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have passenger seats, we're against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this will end with some kind of fatal injury," he said to Týden.cz a year ago.
An incredible tragedy has happened.
A young passenger who worked for the company for two years in Plzeèi died during a trip on the Napolian route.
Without the likely use of the Slovenian truck's guide, the car pulled out of the stop bar and stopped the bus route.
The bus driver suddenly tried to get away with a maneuver, but the front of the bus was hit by a right front of the bus.
The fact that two reserved seats for passenger rest were sold is rejected by Jančura.
"These places cannot be booked on long-distance flights, they are blocked."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
By compensation for the daughter’s family, the Agency does not expect a court judgment, but requires financial compensation from the offender.
Amendments to the law?
In the distant future.
The adjustment of passenger movements on board the bus could be an amendment to the legislation on which the 30-person expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
"The group, however, did not achieve any concrete results.
Buses are not the same, but the point system deals with maximum speed on the motorway and mobile use during driving," says Hoşín expert.
"The Transport Department does not consider the activities of passenger officers to be an essential threat to the safety of passengers," concluded Mr Hanzka, spokesperson, that controlling the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and the labour services.
The hopes of Dusseldorf are going to pass by.
The letter of the WestLB Board of Directors to the bank’s employees does not presiding in the big words.
From the merger of Dusseldorf's financial units and Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, a "SSM of the savings financial group" could be created - it writes a letter on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competition block" into a business like this.
Such a connection could allow for further mergers in the central banking sector of the province.
This is a reading of a general’s desire to prove its ability to act in times of difficulty.
In view of the fact that the Bank of WestLB in its uncertain state is still under a huge pressure.
Not only on behalf of the EU Commission, but also of the Federal Financial Services Authority, which has recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia Government that it will limit the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, between Deka-Bank, which is known for its investment funds, and WestLB, it has been a matter of a kind of relationship for a long time.
Franz Waas, Head of Deka Bank at the end of August, when describing the semester data, knew that the bank on Mainzer Landstrau and a regional bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not see the meaning of the merger.
Nevertheless, Deka's board of directors, which are representatives of the Landesbanks and the savings banks' associations on the other side, instructed the Board of Directors to negotiate with WestLB on the joint business of the WestLB.
During this period, the market share business or certain parts of it may be discussed.
However, the negotiations - the economic circles - have only just begun.
With 3000 employees, the name of Deca-Bank, which is one of the main employers of the financial sector in Frankfurt, does not first arise in connection with the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
In 2003, for a moment, it seemed that Deka Bank was going to be going to the Landesbank with Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this first union did not turn out to be anything.
The plans have hardly been made public, and the Government of the Province has spoken against Helaba’s interest in Helaba.
After that, the other two parties could not find each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead became the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg of Stuttgart.
However, again and again the idea of the relationship between Deka-bank and Landbanks has become a reality.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, President-in-Office of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with the bank.
Nevertheless, the perception of the need for convergence between the different banks in the sector is nevertheless evident.
Now, following the elections in the region of Bavaria, first of all, the relationship between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected to be reached.
For Helaba, this is not necessarily good news.
If further fusion pressure is increased, potential partners may gradually run out on them.
In South Germany, you are only a younger partner, although the financial crisis has been much better managed than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB in Giroverband Hessen-Thüring, which has 8% of the company in Helaba, was excluded at the beginning of the year.
The NorthLB is better off staying.
However, such geostrategic interests are only part of the coin.
On the other side, the question arises as to how different business models of each bank are linked.
In June of this year, he stated that the German Association of Depositaries and Depositaries has not yet answered the crucial question about the business model to be provided for the future of Landesbanks.
Finally, it is possible to copy WestLB, which is obviously not required there.
Thus, the present Directorate-General's provision states that it is certain that the objective of "a complete solution" is the aim of "a complete solution".
How this is compatible with the merger of each unit with Deka Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of the Oktoberfest is known as the "Switzerland Week" known as the "Switzerland Week" of the second weekend of the Oktoberfest.
Elena's the first time, Luca's the third or fourth time that she's ever had.
Now, however, Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is different, says Luca.
Behind them, a strong-bodied bearded man stands beside the five-litre barrel of the Kaiser brand and points out to some 200 people who travel to Oktoberfest, how deep he can get out of his throat.
Elena was going to leave Luca's face first, and then she was going to kiss him.
They arrived in Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus stop Puorta Nova, four buses departing at 23.45 a.m. on "destinazione Monaco, festa della" are expected to arrive at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly for the Italians, the fourth is for the Brazilians only.
In one of the corners of the parking lot, South America has already made a song near their flag, starting the celebration during the night.
And so loudly that's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses belong to Marco, a long, furry coat and a wide, silver-sleeved pair of glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years, but he's only organized three tours this year.
At night, during the day of Oktoberfest, at 22:30, home.
The accommodation would be an unnecessary item, says Marco.
The journey costs EUR 75, which includes a welcome beer Kaiser, accident insurance and a German visit - a German language course in Marco Frankfurt, in accordance with the Bavarian Civil Service Act.
And they're getting their own buses into the night on the freeway to Brennero.
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, passengers will sleep.
All right, so you're gonna need your power again.
They are in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where several Italian buses on motorway 8 take a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives in the parking lot near Theresienwies at half a week as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses that have arrived all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others will gather together, Marco will hold one last information report, explaining the plan of war.
First: Take care of the yellow cap.
On the left side, you can read "Oktoberfest" written in phrase, along with Marco's travel address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, "When the windmill gates open, run", says Dio in the morning.
"Foot!" booking of the accommodation in the back of the tent and running and in the back of the tent.
"not in advance, because we stop and not in the same pillows with all the yellow hats, but spread out in the tent."
The one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, yelling Marco.
And don't forget the tips.
"Show security that you're doing well.
As you leave your seats, take your time!"
The third time is, "Be here again at 9:30 this evening!" You understand me?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the other hand, one man as a road guide places yellow caps on trees, fields and even on the election poster of one of the major Bajoran peoples.
Preparations must be made for a retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as "the Russian Week".
There are no exact figures; 50 thousand people who cross the Alpos in the ostrich are said to arrive from Italy ten per cent of all visitors this weekend.
The Munich police force is confirmed by seven South Tirol police officers, NGOs help the Bajoran Red Cross, which, in national statistics, employs about 200 medical supplies, officials take the first place, preventing the Austrians (approx. 80) and the low-end British people from being cut to the bottom of the drums (approx. 60).
Italians especially liked the Hofbräu beerer.
Nights spent by Hypo Real Estate on creditors of the Hypo Real Estate.
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed Peer Steinbrück's Federal Finance Minister for Finance only last week.
Again, the politician used the word "relatively" and said that the German banking sector would not be spared the crisis developments.
Because this weekend was the end of the week.
Daxon quoted in Munich Hypo Real Estate (HRE) received a billion-dollar loan from the German banks' consortium to protect itself against market volatility.
A person who knew the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loans were to be fired at EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, the Deffa subsidiary is in losses.
Depfa, a newsman in the state, has provided money for long-term projects, and has refinanced itself for a very short period of time - which is now not possible because of the infidelity prevailing on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash balance decreased by 95 percent to EUR 2.77 million and the equity ratio decreased moderately from 1.6 to 1.45%.
Revenues from current revenues and revenue from cash transactions fell by zero compared to the same period of the previous year, income from credits and fixed assets and from the liquidation of the provisions of the transaction has fallen by more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million by way of a reduction of more than EUR 70 per cent.
Only the higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of the ex-depfa group’s ex-post clearing costs, as well as the remuneration of the taxable interest and trades with the group companies, were relatively moderate in ratios of 16 %.
The former public finance company, after its privatisation in 1990, has first defined itself with corporate real estate loans, which were subsequently allocated to Aeral Bank at Aeral Bank.
Due to the limited availability of public funding, Depfa has more intensively incorporated itself into infrastructure projects, as well as into joint projects between private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP), and has expanded its activities internationally.
The value of the subsidiaries is now to be provided by Hypo Real Estate with descriptions that have a "substantial effect" on the group's profit and loss statement - it has been reported quite generally.
In fact, no commission has been paid.
The commission has already been reduced by the third by 2007 to the third level.
The Hypo Real Estate has become a major state and infrastructure investor since Depfa was taken over.
Compared to other financial institutions, it is more dependent on the financing of the interbank market as it does not have any client deposits.
With the collapse of Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the transfer of banks to each other has failed because banks are protecting their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate requires short-term assets to refinance part of the Deffa loan portfolio - some EUR 50 billion - annually.
According to Hypo Real Estate's Communication, the group's funding needs are covered by the loan for a period of time, and the company is protected from "the influence of the current highly inoperable international financial markets."
On the other hand, with the money, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009 thanks to the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, president of HRE, argued, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not need to absorb the financial markets for a long time to come.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This gives hope to the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But due to the dynamics and inestimation of the crisis, there can be no doubt about it.
It is not even incredible that financing is not required to be fully financed.
But the contrary cannot be excluded.
After the late evening of the Saturday night, the bank was still standing on the brink of bankruptcy, the rescue of the equal pass could not reassure the fines.
The stock exchange fell by 75 percent to EUR 3,30 per cent.
On the other hand, bond rates are very well maintained.
While the first-rate debt hardly changes, the exchange rate for reversed bonds fell significantly.
In particular, the crisis concerns the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, as a matter of fact, the duration of the years 2009 to 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds have previously seemed to be a speculative alternative to investment, their valueworthiness should now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the existence of the banking crisis and the financial institution taking the crisis to the House at the time of the Depfa acquisition.
As long as the central banks, governments and less-favoured business banks are still in a position to support the scheme, it is possible to recover the benefits by the deadline.
Or it will happen, in which no one at present dares to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports relating to the partial state ownership, there is a certain likelihood of a certain probability that it is now only a legitimate remorse.
For long-term creditors, the decision to change from their investment could lead to an unforeseeable night.
Short-term investors may, however, use the sale to provide a reserve for taxes on foreign exchange gains in the following year.
Sylvana and the secret of the secret of the secret of the box of Sylvana and the secret of the secret of the secret of the secret of Sylvana and the secret of
When a 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to show up at Tachibana High School on his first day of education, the girls start to ski: the German girl totally "kava"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word of the mangas - in the new exchange students blog about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan is the first day of education.
I'm so worried.
I was on my way to school and I was on my way.
I live at the end of my life, on a temporary basis, and on a 40-minute journey to the Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, but luckily I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of the teaching in Tachiban is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start to pick up at eight o'clock until they start a short conversation with the teacher, the "home room."
But before the teaching started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I am not the kind of person who wants to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, my hostess was wearing an old skirt, a shirt, blue knee-shirt and black leather shoes.
So I stood before your cathart in this penry, and I tried to put it all right: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana..." - Sylvana, I came from Germany, and my birthday will be in a week.
Right now, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language for two years.
All 31 girls whispered, rushed and waved, and I kept hearing the word "blow".
I've known this from my men.
This Japanese girl is part of a basic vocabulary, and it means, "Holy, sweet."
And then I snuck into my seat quickly.
The girl sitting next to me smiled a lot, and it was a pleasure to have her sitting next to the exchange students.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the bell was ringing, they were running in a regular hurry.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my stomach - and it's quite difficult to understand Japanese English.
In the meantime, after that, everyone packed out their driver's license.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German tidbit sandwiches.
I got spiced rice, small sausages, salads made of cucumbers and hazelnuts, fruit and a kind of tofu ground meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
Foods are exportable, and they have a completely novel taste.
In fact, everything is very good.
Yeah, well, maybe with the exception of the sloe-sloe-sloe-sloe-sloe-sloe-sloe-sloe-sloe, brown.
In Japanese school, the fly is just lunch.
A girl may give a boy a breakout made with her own hands, which is especially artisticly composed - in the hope of getting to know the boy closer in the lunchtime.
I read about this in my manga comic book.
I wonder if I can monitor this here too.
"Why is Japan?" asked my girlfriends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Dubai for a year.
I always said:
"But he simply charms me."
I've been reading mangas for years.
And that I would better understand comic books and their culture, and that at some point I would learn Japanese.
It was clear to me, then, that I would have to travel here sometime.
It is attractive to tradition and habits.
And these things are so expensive here.
On the one hand, it is a country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even though it's the biggest city I've ever seen."
The worms have their emotions, too.
Does this mean that you feel a fear?
Joseph LeDoux, a neurologist, is convinced of this: Animals also have emotions.
But how can we test whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
In the "Edge" magazine, famous scientists have been publishing their articles for years.
SPIEGEL IS ONE of the series "What does it take to be true without being able to prove it?" it looks at the answers to the question.
I believe that the animal has emotions and other conditions of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have knowledge.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the primary configuration of all the human brain is the same.
However, as we examine other species and disassemble the questions of perception or consciousness in general, we find it difficult to enter a mobile field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is put in danger, it does the same as many other animals: pretends to be dead, escapes or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, resulting from comparable personal experience among some researchers.
However, I don't believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to the animal.
On the one hand, circuits of human consciousness are almost always included in the lateral pre-legal brain (due to its role in the short-term memory and in the implementation/management function).
This wide range is higher than the other primates and seems to be completely missing than other organisms.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the pre-14 brain, such as knowing who we are or, if we are able to plan and decide, it is reasonable to assume that man is different even from the other primates.
Another dramatic specificity lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since human experience is a major part of the language involved, it is often claimed that it depends on consciousness.
In such cases, the animal may be excluded.
However, even if it is not dependent on language, the language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, is likely to be very different from most of our consciousnesss.
It is therefore difficult to determine how consciousness can be in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure awareness in an internal and subjective way, and the specific hardware cannot be analysed on the basis of our own experience, then our research poses serious problems.
Most of my ideas relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
The knowledge processes of animals could be examined regardless of their duration, and this is exactly what happens in the case of attempts on short-term memory of primates, especially in the case of visualisation.
However, this assumption, which is also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, is based on the nerve relationships of consciousness rather than on the facsimile mechanisms: It can be the same or not.
Thus, this assumption underlines the importance of the pre-sanctionary brain brain in creating visualisation.
What happens to emotions?
This is due to the fact that an individual system, as well as fear, is active in the brain that is aware of its activity.
What we call "intimidation" is therefore the mental state in which we are when it involves working memory (or consequences, such as physical reactions) of the operation of the protective system in the brain where it is located.
In this way, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the cortex that are characteristic of the primates and, in particular, man.
In addition to the linguistic nature, the sense of perception is divided into subtle stages, because we can distinguish and describe situations by means of words and grammar, as well as describe them to others.
On the other hand, Oto Damascus believes that emotions come from a simpler part of the body perception of the brain cortex and brain stem, as well as from Jaak Pänseep, who, on the other hand, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it can play an easy role in all-species emotions.
Clearly, I can't deny this, but I find it inconclusive.
Panseep considers that what seems to be fear for rats and humans, in any case it is likely to also feel: How can it be checked that rats and humans feel the same way they do?
A cockroach escape in the event of danger, does he fear too?
In my opinion, just the same behavior is not yet evidence of the same experience.
Although the neurological collapse continues to help: rats and humans are similar to brain drains, cockroaches have no brain.
But the brain stem is responsible for the emotions?
And even if it could be shown to humans, how can we prove this for the rat?
I think it's for rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are likely to be essentially different from the tape (as human knowledge is based on the main circuits and the language), I would rather explore the emotional behaviour of the rats than the emotional emotions of the rats.
In any case, in this area, there is progress in the neurological level, if we measure the same in terms of rats and humans.
As far as rats are concerned, I do not search for language and knowledge, nor do I know emotions, because I do not know if they exist.
This may seem to be a brief attitude, but I'd rather go forward than keep hitting the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: A period of grace for Poland and Ukraine.
Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik informed that the preparations would shortly be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees trust in Ukraine in the UEFA Bordeaux decision and the evidence that they believe that Poland is able to organise the European Championship together with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still a lot of work to be done in each country."
In the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are lagging behind in the construction of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums could be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We need to work on high-speed now," said Grigori Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they were meant to take a more radical step.
Following numerous scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN, which was replaced by the independent inspector Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to act in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency Drzewiecki.
"We assured Michel Platini, President of the UEFA, that this would not adversely affect the preparations for the 2012 EB."
Only in the last year had several first league teams to be assigned to the lower class due to manipulation, and eventually the licence holder had to be postponed.
The prodigy of the Archaeological Quaid will return to us.
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, talking about her privacy in the interview - and now she's having a problem with her ex-husband.
He who returns - and beats back
The war of late roses with the Meg Ryan -ά Quaid ex-wife: The two Hollywood actresses, seven years after their divorce, fought a bad fight before the public.
Ryan, in an interview with the American InStyle magazine last week, for the first time, spoke about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, with a lot of pain."
He only learned how many women he cheated on him after the divorce.
The spiritual stratification was due to the press work of Ryan's new film "Women", which tells a story of a break-in.
He was determined to respond firmly to the call of a unfaithful husband: "A terrible" - declared the 54-year-old actor to the "New York Daily News" daily, "that He'd be bored-unsuspectingly repeating and resuspecting the history of our relationship."
Also, "sorry" is that 16-year-old joint boys, Jack, are repeatedly "revealed to remind you of the pain and the change that divorce causes for a child."
While he's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has been married again and recently married to a twin.
His reply to the answer to that question is concluded by the following cut-off: "My life will go on in any event.
"I can be happy to know that I have an entire family, with everything the best is."
Flights and hotel prices are falling.
In the first half of 2008 European routes and hotels were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to one recent survey, in Germany, flight routes were not less than 50 % cheaper than in Germany.
Airways and hotel rooms have once more been more favourable - so it can be concluded that one of the results of an American Express travel and financial service provider's study.
The company analysed its first half 2008 bookkeeping data and determined a significant fall in the second quarter following the first quarter price increase.
After the price on the hotel market has been rising for years, many places have become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities examined increased by an average of 6.9 per cent in 2007 compared to 2007.
However, during the period between August and June, prices were already 3.6 percentage points lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most obvious in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees this as a reason for this at the low price of the dollar, which led to the "passenger travel of the American tourists".
The decrease in hotel room prices has a greater impact on financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than on cities such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In Norway, the 26.3% increase in hotel prices is a European record.
As regards the prices of flights, there has also been a dynamic change in the first quarter of the year.
Due to the decrease in kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, while long-term flights with high fuel consumption were subject to a cost reduction of 29.2 per cent.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist flights decreased by 1.5 per cent on average compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class prices showed a much less moderate change than in the first class.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices rose by 11.9 per cent and decreased by 23.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The cost of domestic routes in Germany is estimated to have decreased by half.
The reason for the price decrease lies, on the one hand, in a moderate economic growth, the company claims.
In many segments of the flight market, demand has been weak.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises flights between the United States and Europe, increases the pressure on competition by means of the Open Skies agreement.
The tense situation is demonstrated by the fact that the airlines are cancelling their loss-making operations and that many airlines are bankrupt in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe that affects 24 Republics.

"We need the second goal" - he snuck Hermann Rieger on the front of the Hamburg arena cabins.
There's not much going on in the Catacombs, the break is over, and most of them are back in their seats again.

So you found your request to be heard in the right place.
Mr. Cornelius Jol, the assistant coach, made a statement and presented his thumb in a uniform manner.
Cornelius is the brother of Coach Martin Jol of Hamburg.
His order could have been a similar word: Here with the second goal.
The execution of the order has failed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight" - he later admitted Marcel Jansen.
Reinhardt was "suspected by him" as well as Reinhardt.
The 1: 0 (1: 0) score is due to the head of Mladen Petric in Hamburg (11.); and to the fact that the very weak gladibaches were not able to cause pain to the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory", he put together Martin Jol.
The Hamburg Spr will be 1 January 2015 on Monday.
The viewers have celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the screen, which presents their team as the top class of the championship.
This is going to be a party party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcel Jansen.
He wonders that the intermediate certificate of the table is more about the uncertainty of the league than about the domination of the HSV.
Although the team finds itself in the bottom of its late-sponsored experience - thanks to the Brazilian  most important venerations and Silva, the goalk Petric and Jansen, who got it from FC Bayern - but is not yet making a scene.
"We need more sense and deceiving," said Jol.

The dark matter affects the flight of space probes.
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing ingenuity among researchers for years. The dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
The applicant fears that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The "Ulysses" space probe flew in space for nearly 18 years.
The soon-to-be fuel pipelines threaten the death of ice cream.
Scientists have been confused for years by a mysterious phenomenon, a swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means the gravitational value of space probes, during which they gain additional impetus in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So probes can save a large amount of fuel.
Like Ulysses, the European-American Cassini-Huygens research facility used this physical trick as well as the sunscreen of Ulysses.
However, what has been amazeing researchers for years: Flying objects are not fully acting as expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, there are abnormalities in the speed.
The probes suddenly speed up or slow down.
Physics has so far found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized as a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity cannot be fully valid, which considers mass attraction of the substance as a curve of space, even though it is not even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity.
Stephen Adler, an American physicist, of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by the astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly can be responsible for the dark matter, which may even be right near the Earth", says Adler.
Space scanners have only learned about the existence of the dark matter for ten years.
It is likely to produce a gravity force that can be observed by the effects on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light will be released or crushed.
Scientists believe that a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is made up of dark matter.
The tourists kidnapped in Egypt have been released.
After ten days in prison with their kidnappers, the tourists that were taken in Egypt are free again - confirmed by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
Sudanese kidnappers have claimed millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting before the release of hostages, it is said that six hostages have lost their lives.

WILSE will report on the most important cases.
European tourists who have been taken away in Sahara are free of charge.
This has been reported to be the report of the Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabija Arab broadcaster and the Italian media.
According to the advice from the Italian TG 24, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs of Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of the release: "Our fellow prisoners and other hostages have been released.
At present, we are examining your health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizen and their eight Egyptian escorts are safe and sound - the Egyptian state broadcast has been protected.
19 participants in the desert expedition are said to be on their way to Cairo.
The causes of the shooting before the release of the hostages continue to be cloudy: According to an Egyptian Security Officer, hostages have already shown the authority to release the hostages when the Sudanese army was rapidly killing them.
"The problem has been solved.
They accepted the ransom," said the official.
"It was only about taking over the hostages" when suddenly "the surprise happened."
Sudanese soldiers were shot and two arrested in the region between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over by one of the wifes of the hostage Germans.
The "al-Masri al-Jom" daily, referring to a German broker, announced that the release of hostages is lost because kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages release female hostages after payment of the ransom.
Men are being held by kidnappers until safe escape routes are found.
The Japanese German Embassy refused to take a position on the report.
"The murder has led to the violence of stepfather".
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because she was raped by her father for years.
In prison, 57-year-old Michael Trerise, who lives in Stithians village in Cornwall County, has been in prison for 6 years after he has confessed to an attempt to report illegitimate rape.
The court of authentic justice has learned that she has regularly bound her stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between her five and seven years of age.
In one of Trerie's known words, she said, "I feel presumptuous about my death."
At the hearing, it was said that Randle killed himself at the age of 34, at the home of Plymouth in Mutley district, on 1 April 2007.
When he lived in Coventry as a child, Trerese tied and tied up the trash before the sleepovers while his mother worked in a hive.
Trerie left her wife in the 1980s, and she chose Cornwall again as her place of residence.
She moved to Plymouth, her now-born daughter.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Cultural Protection Organisation, was persecuted by the fears of violence twice a week.
In 2006, D.A. Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to love surfing and biking passionately, said she said "emotionally dead" and "divorceeded about life".
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in plymouth.
It's probably a bag that was used to strangle itself.
Mr. Randle got into a conflict with his daughter's stepfather, who finished her confession by letter, saying, "I've always tied her up and tied her eyes.
I didn't bother you sexually.
I feel responsible for my death."
Judge Christher Elwen told Trerise: "You are a very remarkable fetist, and I'm sure this was terrible to his sacrifice, especially if he was only seven years old.
This stupid family novel ended with the victim's suicide.
The fact that if it didn't, the case would probably never have been brought to justice is even more thought-out."
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the impact, according to Stephanie's parents, on your criminal daughter over the years.
If this didn't happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
An important data-losing officer has been accused of being charged with the prosecution of an important data-related officer.
According to the BBC's information, an official breach of a secret is being accused of the government official who left strictly secret documents on a train in June.
The man was seconded to the D.A. when he left two strictly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the mildest charge of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of a deliberate offence.
According to Frank Gardner, his supervisor to the BBC Ministry of Defence, the move surprised many people in the White Hall.
"They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the Government would treat the case as an internal matter," he said.
A staff member who is not available has been accused under paragraph 8.1 of the Law.This paragraph is about preserving information.
The Public Prosecutor's Office proposed that the Metropolitan Police represent the man for his rather sensitive work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents it lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
On Monday, the decision was notified and then moved from home to unknown places.
Household entities pay B & Amp;B's account.
The United Kingdom's households of the economy can count £80 million in more than a dollar account after saving the Bank of Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The government spent GBP 14 billion on protecting the deposits held at the Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of depositors, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Home Builders, "it's annoying that companies and their members have to pay for it.
Finally, the 14 billion important loans will be repaid after the loan of Bradford &amp; Bingley will be repaid.
However, in the meantime, the interest accrued will be added annually to the 700 financial company that uses the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is annoying that institutions that have been cautious so far ... now have to pay the accounts of those institutions which have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We knew that each company had to pay a proportion of the amount of deposits it held, and the companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to deduct £81 million to pay the first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Trade Union of Housing Companies, told the BBC that he considered the measure to be unfair.
"It is alarming that institutions that have to pay the accounts of well less precautionary institutions that have acted with caution during the recovery of the building market."
According to BSA, none of the companies had gone wrong since they started operating in 1945.
"In every way, we need to examine this matter in the next few weeks in order to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant bill," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover a period of 7 months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, a full annual rate will be paid, which could even be twice the current rate.
Since housing cooperatives are self-help entities, without traders, and eventually members will have to pay the invoice either at higher prices or at lower interest rates received after their deposits.
The price of milk per litre increases by fivepence per litre.
In the field, people have to pay more for the milk.
The dairy company in Luxembourg announced that it would increase the wholesale price of milk by another fivepence on Mondays per litre.
This year, this is the second price increase since the two pennies increase in February and following a survey carried out by an advisory company.
Dealers decide on their own whether or not to further increase prices for consumers.
Before the increase in February, the price of milk in the Land of Frankfurt was last amended in 2002.
They rejected the request of the former Member of the Bangladeshan Parliament to defend themselves freely.
The Supreme Court rejected the application for protection of the former Member of Parliament Sheikh Hasina, which means that he may be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer told me that the court refused to defend him on the grounds that, during his parliamentary representative's term, 50 million takas (729,700 dollars) were checked out by a businessman (729,700 dollars).
This case is just one of the countless cases of corruption brought against it.
Sheikh Hasina, an old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released for bail this month.
Sheikh Hasan will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but his party, Awami League, demands that the government of the Republic of the country, supported by the military, give him full freedom first.
According to the reports, although he has been released on parole to go to medical treatment abroad, it is not clear from the conditions of his release that it is possible to maintain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
"The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request for bail, that there is no need for it, as it has been temporarily put on the loose and is taking part in a medical treatment abroad," we found out from Rafique Huq's lawyer in Huq.
"We will appeal against the decision of the appeal court."
According to his lawyer's arguments, he needs to be able to defend himself in order to return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League Party told us on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after 17 October.
Last year, he was arrested after the government of the Republic, supported by the army, took over power, but was released from prison in June to go to medical treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges brought against them.
Concerns about the Afghan polio vaccination programme.
According to the UN, almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been excluded from the recently organised polio vaccination programme for Taliban violence.
Last week, the UN organised vaccination operations in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children living in parts of Helmand and Kandahar, located south.
According to a UN spokesperson, this happened despite a promise made by the Taliban: they will not attack or prevent thousands of staff working on the vaccination.
An appeal against the BSkyB in relation to ITV has been refused.
BskyB’s appeal against the decision of the Competition Committee has been rejected, which has refused to reduce its interest in the rival television network, ITV.
The Court of Justice has ordered the BSCA to reduce its participation in ITV from 17,9 % to 7,5 % in ITV.
In the past, the Committee concluded that the share of BSkyB is an obstacle to competition and that it has unfair influence over ITV.
The BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 and thus effectively prevented NTL from buying ITV, which has since been appointed as Virgin Media.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the share acquired by BSKYB from ITV was liable to undermine ITV independence by encouraging the Competition Committee to initiate an investigation.
The director of the Virginia, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the supervision of the Offcom, all opposed the purchase.
The BSkyB argued that the obligation to suspend I-participate is an unfair and disproportionate compensation - given that BSkyB has declared that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation of the state's attorney's case into the U.S. attorney's case.
The U.S. Attorney General has been appointed D.A. to investigate the operation of nine U.S. state prosecutors in 2006.
The step followed that the case report prepared by the Chief Inspector General of the Court of Justice criticises the decisions of the government officials.
The report was reviewed by the officials of the White House, the legislators and the former State Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was a fear that the state's attorneys would be lost on political intent.
Ms. Nora Dannehy, Special Prosecutor, you will now be investigating whether the officials in the investigation have tried to stop the judiciary from lying.
"Serious charges concerning possible crime have not yet been investigated and have not been clarified" - said Glen Fine, Inspector General.
One of his main proposals was to appoint an Special Prosecutor to testify to witnesses.
The series began with the removal of nine state prosecutors from the U.S. Attorneys' file in December 2006.
At the time, they said that the state's attorneys were released for their poor performance.
However, it was later found that the civil prosecutors had received nothing worse than many of their colleagues. Therefore, many people came to the conclusion that there was a political stance behind the dismissals.
Some state prosecutors participated in criminal proceedings against high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to participate in the investigation of electoral fraud charges against Democrats.
The U.S. Attorneys are investigating the government's commission and conducting court cases.
It is possible to disappear at any time, but for political reasons it cannot be removed from office.
At the time, the then head of the judiciary, the US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks on the basis of the exterminations, and finally resigned.
A number of other officials in the court case have also given up their resignations.
In his report, the Superintendent was highly critical of Gonzales's role in the case, according to the public prosecutor's "primary responsibility" for dismissal, "dejected" management, and "provided himself" from the process.
Other civil servants, including Karl Rove, former assistant of the senior Bush, are appreciated by the fact that they did not cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic confession is given.
The rock star Meat Loaf will be awarded the Q Awards award team for the epistle called "Bat Out Of Hell" at the award team.
The singer who takes over a special grand prize next week at the London Festival said he thought it was an honor to be honored.
The eight minutes, fifty-five-long song Meat Loaf, 1977, was the song of the song of the album of the popular successful harvest album.
Coldplay received the most marked this year's awards, four categories were added to the candidate list.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of the Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres and "Bat Out Of Of Hell"."
Jim Steinman's song required a great deal of voice, and this voice was Meat Loafé.
The song started with an almost two-minute instrument session.
In 1979, he appeared as a small album, and he reached 15th place on the hit list.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Of Hell" has been present for almost nine years on the hit list, and after that more than 40 million copies were sold.
Meat Loaf - really known as Marvin Lee Day - has a recent health problem, including during 2003 an operation due to a heart rhythm disorder following a collapse on the stage.
In 2007 he had to cancel a few concerts due to acute encephalitis.
Later, it turned out to be a cyst on the tone of his voice.
It is a blind city street, often forgotten and may soon be sold.
New York City has thousands of freeways, tours and other roads. Some of them are famous, others perform purely practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-term resident residents find it difficult to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The little road is in the East Village and is heading north from the First Street - without reaching the Second Street - between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
It is about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and it is much more like a dusty alley than a main road road.
No street signs.
Practically, you cannot find it on a standard map.
However, on the street, there are hookers.
There it is, for example, the building of the Valon Bay, the building of the recently built building building of the First Street building.
He wants to rediscover Extra Place and make sure that he can reach the stores and bets of new buildings in a cleaner way.
The dignitaries of the street include the long-term neighbors who were caught by the bad news street that it was the only remains of the past past past past the renovations of the area.
However, the owner of the street, the building conservation and development department of the city, is not in favour of insisting on it.
This month, at a meeting of the Regional Management Committee in the region, the representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal to the builder to buy the street.
However, the Committee would prefer that the street would remain in town management and requested a new plan for next month, reported to Susan Stetzer, district manager of Regional District Number 3.
"There are a lot of areas in the city now, and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"There may also be proposals for the renovation and management of Avalon that may be made, but we also want to ensure that it is made available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to hide the small street again and that it wanted to provide seats, a part of which would be used by a coffee shop, which the builder is expected to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this monthly meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson at Valon Bay, said that although the company wishes to use the street, it is not required to possess it.
"The main aspect of the Avalon Bay is to refurbish this pendant alley and make it a common place in public", he said, adding that the city has proposed to buy it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson of the Building Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office is responsible for building development and not for managing buildings.
Compared to his preferr neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place is not much of historical importance.
Some say he got the name "his land" in 180 when Philip Minthorne's great estate was handed over to many children, and no one was required for the narrow strip.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006 and the back exit of the CBGB to Extra Place was opened, and the road is perhaps the most likely to be the photo taken on the cover of the album of the Ramones "Rocket to Russia".
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, the manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November of 1976.
"It was full of garbage, dress-suits, barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they owned the Central East Village oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, should remain in the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare nature, which is a piece of the town that has remained practically unchanged and which needs to be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, writer of the blog entitled "The Stormful New York of Jeremiah", entitled "The Book of Siralmak, entitled bitter nostalgia," wrote on his blog part of the story on Extra Place, which was published in the brochure "The New Yorker" on the newspaper "The New Yorker" in Krist2.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, bounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and spray windows, and where the wind carries a week's newspaper in the canals."
The street, apart from some exceptions, looked the same way a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street by the back door, which used to lead to the CBGB, and now belongs to a higher-priced store of clothing in its place.
On the walls, it was graffiti, and an empty 0.7-litre beer bottle was lying next to a thrown fresh paper towel.
Many commentators have said that there is no way to remember the Extra Place, but they think that there is a need for renovation.
Fields told us that some think that some underestimate his current situation in the world.
"I spent the last few years of my life in dark, bitter and disgusting places," he said.
A discussion on dual-lingual education: Continued exposure to the English language environment.
The student in this part of Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Isumi will discuss the opinion of candidates on multilingual education.
Lance T. Isumi, who is the co-founder of the book "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need a school choice", an experienced researcher and director of education research in California at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research.
It is not easy to be in favour of voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obma's proposals on education include the following:
Obama's campaign is that "Afro-American and Spanish lips students are much less likely to obtain a degree than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such performance differences, Obama's education plan strongly supports - among other things - "temporary multilingual education" for English learners.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to multilingual education, which places emphasis on education in non-English, outweighs his interest in combating high performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep comprehensive school in the east of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school students have a flat lips and low income.
Over a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, learns English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results at the 2008 state math test.
It is equally impressive that 93% of the fourth graders have completed excellent English language and literature tests.
This incredible performance was not achieved by the instrument Omauvene, on the other hand, that Omauvene.
Sixth Street places emphasis on repeating, exercising, continuing to assess skills and rejecting objections.
And this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the school education principle is the "full inclusion" of students studying English in the language environment.
The main point of the method of immersion is the use of English solely in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes multilingual education, said: "We've had a huge success in walking into a classroom, not knowing who the student was who came 12 months ago from Mexico."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama be an example of a significant number of other school students with a soft lips and English-students, such as Sixth Street Prep, be facing schools such as the school of Sixth Street Prep?
The progress made by the school should be clear to answer, but because of the education policy of its own party (National Education Associations have been supporting multilingual education for a long time) and because of its consistent self-responsibility for multilingual education, we cannot be certain of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants need to learn English, Obama recently expressed an inestimating opinion on the matter when she said that people should not be so concerned about the "exceptly what it was about" of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "They should be able to speak Spanish to their children."
If Obama really wants to make a difference between the results, she should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
Due to renewed economic concerns, oil prices fell steeply in the wake of the economic crisis.
Oil prices fell steep on Monday because of concerns that the rescue plan for the financial markets in America will not be able to boost the economy.
The crude oil stock returned seven percent to $99.80 on the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices have fallen by over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the stock exchanges have been swinging through the financial confusion on Wall Street and some powerful storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price reached $16,29 per barrel in July, almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before again falling under the influence of the enormous uncertainty of financial markets.
On Monday, the concern has reintroduced investors even after the convention's presiding announcement: the weekend has been agreed on an economic rescue operation, which is the biggest in history so far.
The warnings that the financial crisis would not be over for a long time have been reported were that the financial crisis would not be over.
In the latest event of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will purchase the Wchovia Company's banking business, announced on Monday by the government.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments share the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Barclays Capital’s analysts say that the result of the desperate weekend’s negotiations seems to be “as if the rescue action failed to improve the atmosphere for trading in the stock market.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods such as oil will also decline.
"The future of the stock market, interest rates and foreign exchange rate markets has become uncertain worldwide" wrote Deutsche Bank as an analyst for investors.
"We believe that the product market will not be avoided by the "pest".
The main issue with regard to trade in goods is the extent to which the "disease" of the United States is infecting the world, especially China."
As the slowdown in economic growth has caused oil consumption, banks' analysts have cut their expectations for next year by 20%, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 2009.
In the second quarter of the second quarter, the team set up a record of the team.
After spending more than eight seasons of time in the Jets field than anyone else, Shaun Ellis, playing in the position of defensive end, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational game.
"I have never seen that before," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark cloud in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback 12-yardos touchdown pass to Laveranues Coles, which was the best for an afternoon in which their developing cooperation developed significantly further.
Favre gave Cole two more touchdown passports in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-life.
"I wasn't sorry for the effort," said Favre about all the pass he gave to Coles.
"Pokka's a good player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other so far, regardless of what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals from controlling Kurt Warner.
The cornerback player Darrelle Revis caught a bad pitch and threw 32 yards back touchdown.
Eric Smith, a safe player touched another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This would have been the last turn of the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets acquired Jay Feely's 20-yard field was fired, setting the 34:0 result.
That was the best result the Jets has achieved in a quarter of a year.
When they asked Jets's supervisor, Eric Mangini, to characterise the game's jaysing character, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When they told him that both - in the third quarter, the Cardinals got 21 points so that the Jets got none - Mangini said, "I have to tell you, I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third quarter.
We got a lot of points in the short term."
The rested Gebrselassie decides on its own world record.
Ethiop Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people thought that he was the best mid- and long-term traveler who had ever lived in Berlin when he decided to make his own world record in Berlin, which made him the first to run 42,2 kilometers in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory achieved during the time of 59:59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on the comfortable plain course 2:04:26 last result, which was achieved in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie's 26th world record of Gebrselassie's career in so many areas that he won or won the world's championship or world record from 1500 metres to marathons in all years.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, afraid - which, looking back on it, may have proved to be a serious precaution - that air pollution would further exacerbate the asthmatic problem.
Instead, you entered the marathon in Berlin.
In almost perfect circumstances - daytime, initially at 9 °C and at 13 °C - he won Gebrselassie Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes at 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the marathons have not started again, such as Gebrselassie and the Kenyan Paul Tergat have turned to the longer term, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa in 1998 with a score of 2:06:05 in Berlin.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two months ago, his pair of feet were cramped and he couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, during the resting season it was freshen up and it was not rusty.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"It all worked out perfectly.
A week ago I started training again, and today I had doubts, but everything was all right."
He has received some criticisms, particularly from Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia, that he is using too many tools in his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathons, saying he's running on track and putting world records before the competition spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's magnitude in the long run.
Gebrselassie Sunday, with four Kenyan rolling operations in 1:02:04, reached the scene during 1:02:04.
A two-tier Kenyan carrier, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrsselassie, after the whirlwinders were exhausted.
Not much more than 4.8 miles before the target Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last spray, which was the second target of 2:05:36, fixed by 5 minutes at the best of the individual.
Kamathi is a third party to 2:07: below.
In the female competition, Irina Mikitenko, who was born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, has closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest winner, 2:19:19.
The ellipse is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25:25.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won a surprise at London marathon 2:24:14.
The Peking Olympics were unable to participate due to the alleged back injury, but it was quickly healed and won the Berlin marathon, where it fixed its individual tip by five minutes, the third marathon run in which it took part.
He won the competition on a smart count: first he allowed Ethiopian and Kenyan groups of four to advance and gain significant leadership, and then came after about 30 km.
Etióp Aske Tafa Magersa was the second target in time 2:21.31, while the Kenyan Helena Kiprop became the third winner of 2:25:01.
A separate town, the black pride and the instigation of black people.
There is a quiet small town hidden in an experience in Greatater Orange - some far from everything that is gloomy, loud and huge - where the pride and complexity of African American life experience have been born.
Eatonville, the first pure black city to integrate into the country and which was the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy as it said in 1935: "The five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimsuits, plenty of guanavas and two schools without a prison."
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have been to the annual Zora Festival. The Eatonville Festival is held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer in the Harlem Renaissance.
However, in many ways, the city that it described and became a tourist resort - which is also included in the Florida travel document published by the Project of the Federal Scriptures of the Ages - apart from the environment.
As independent as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that Florida, city blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people, who "as little of us know about us that they do not know what they are missing."
Even in the year that the black president, Barack Obama, encourages an open exchange of views on the race issue, many here are distrustful of the outsider's looks.
"Beware of how to tell our story," reported the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to tell me so badly."
Eatonville has long been composed of a paradox of victory and fight.
At the same time, black standout is a historically important model, but at the same time a community of almost all people, where poverty indicators reach the national average of doubles.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of the result of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes lauded, southern, urban, black culture, which springs in the shadow of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the people here are both proud and defensive at the same time.
And the picture from Eatonville has been important since Zora, (this is what everyone calls Hurstont).
In the books written in honest, strong prayer - such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes There Watching God" (1937) - they presented their hometown to the world.
Five paragraphs of the Florida Guide transformed the city which is near the 17th Road. This is the way from the long-forgotten center of Florida to one of the places of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave both in life and in literature, as well as the drums, introduced his readers to the business of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more confidential spheres.
He wrote: "From the road to the right we can find modern public school, brown on the basis of white, with carefully kept courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller cares about, although I can't read and write."
She mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that might be necessary for temporary accommodation."
Thus, in a few words, Hurston has linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remorse and sex.
It is clear that the Fodor's guide has been presented differently.
This description really isn't all of them.
"Zora said the way they were," reported the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls, who Hurston made immortal by cited by his snooze stories that men told about their beauty.
He added: "Some of these people didn't like it."
Hurstonra is still remembered here as the live separate, who has often visited home after his family moved to Florida Jacksonville.
The 77-year-old Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a whirlpool of Chews, smoking cigarettes and long-sleeved in a city where people still proud of their glorious outfits.
Most people were enchanted by him, said Franklin, but a lot of people were impersonating him.
"The people are always happy to see the Zora," said Franklin.
However, on a terrace looking at Lake Sabia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair in a tug: "I never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that he, together with a large part of the world, forgot about it on Eaton.
He was ever a popular writer, contemporary Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
There were no significant manifestations or large public readings in Eaton.
"I don't think they understood how much he gave up the world, or what he left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography published in 2003, entitled "The Storm of Storm."
The turning point came in 1980.
Officers of Orange County wanted to build a five-band route across the city instead of the two-band main road, the Kennedy Avenue, which was an important part of the community's life.
The expanding Orlény has already entered the state-related Interstate 4 motorway on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still alive after a difficult period of time.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the struggles against racial confusion have tasted hatred with the community.
"At that time a bunch of white boys came over and threw away seats on the side of the road with oranges and other things," said Franklin.
"There was a man who died of this.
They threw a brandy out of a car."
In 1955, Hurston, in his letter to the newspaper "The Spring Sentinel", questioned the decision of the Supreme Court to preside over violent integration, saying "Brown v Board of Education": "It is more insulting, rather than respecting my species."
Today's residents say that school desegregation was positive in some ways, weakened the consistency of the eatonville people and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black kids usually hug them - I remember - man has taken over his teacher this morning and evening" - reported N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, Executive Director of the Non-Professional Organization "We're Keeping Eatonville Community".
"This took so long for students and teachers to come from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Natiri.
However, human rights have helped many others in Zora Neale Hurston's increase - in black writers, artists and artists who have overcome prejudices, as he did, with a wonderful confidence and lines like this: "How can anyone rob themselves of the pleasure of my company!
This is understandable to me."
In 1975 Alice Walker wandered away to Hurston's unmarked grave and started fighting to give back his reputation.
Six years later, a recognized Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was put into the bookseller's shelf, bringing it back to America's symbols.
The road construction project would have started just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was refocused on her attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors thought he was a rescuer.
In the community community, he started organising a Hurston Festival to show what the county would destroy with its main route.
Thousands of fans have arrived at the opening event two years later, and many have been returning to the ceremony every January.
A few years later, the county withdrew from its proposal for a road map.
"As a result of the five-way procession, the community re-established, fully connected, which means real civil dignity," said Nathiri.
Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the image of the city itself.
There was an increasing number of people living outside the city, such as Lawyer Rachelle Munson, who began to attend church in 1993, and the locals began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, a new, uniform (born from Hurston) library was opened on Kennedy Avenue, repacked and swept.
Eatonville still has Florida's cuckoo egg: it's not quite ten km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban outskirt would be during the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families founded it in the 1880s.
(Today, 90% of the inhabitants are black.)
They still take caution in those aliens who come here looking for the history and meaning of Eatonville.
Most interviews require permission and some things such as the oldest fresco of Eatonville, which is painted by a white man and depicts blacks on the ground, should not be photographed.
Many people in Eatonville, including the confident teacher, who is particularly attracted to a lively woman, fear that they will misjudge their disfellowshiped community.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew more and more, the pride of the hometown grew growing growing.
Young people are increasingly looking at Eatonville as Hurston sees his own species: neither better, better, nor worse, as proud, creative, busy, fooly and disturbed as other racial and ethnic groups in the United States.
An honest civil bond is being kept quiet by Franklin's nephew, the 18-year-old, Edwinud, who plans to return after college to work with the local government or the police, who thinks they're in need of help.
And it seems that the younger ones have learned to characterise Eatonville well, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin, Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just travel here think that this city is nothing compared to the rest," said Alondra Kenon recently after worship on a Sunday.
"But if someone stops and spends some time to get to know his history, it's a very nice town."
Here in New York, we all speak the language of finance.
Nothing changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the magazine balds and the huge TV projectors on Times Square, I wouldn't notice they were in a storm.
They would never know that, with the glass-shaped, bee-shaped offices above their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who control New York have been living the most difficult days since 1929.
The couriers are still squeezing their metal trucks on the sidewalks, carrying trays loaded with muffins to the breakfast meetings.
There's still a single-mouthed man who's still hovering between the cages, carrying fifty of them as human mules, who's hanging through their shoulders in a guarilla-like ring.
The office workers are still in line for their sweet breakfast bakery on the sidewalk of the food trucks, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 on a daily basis between 4 and 7 p.m.
I did not feel that it would be any crisis until I decided to open a new bank account in spite of all the news of the emergency report this Saturday afternoon.
I didn't mean to do this at the afternoon's rest, but I had about 20 people standing in front of me at the local branch of my JP Morgan Chase bank.
Not at the banker's window where money can be collected or paid, but at the customer service counter where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store and where new customers open a bank account.
Many people before me - I learned later from Starr, the "delivered" banker - took place with the same intention as I did before me.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money out of the smaller banks in their home, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took money from the so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), from the credit cooperatives, and from small-town savings banks that only operate in one state and allegedly treat their customers as family members.
In the past year, 15 of these banks have been quietly destroyed.
Over the past few days, a bank with a debt of USD 327 billion has been declared bankrupt and when the New Yorkers came home this weekend, another bank, Wachovia, made a bank that made 440 billion savings.
The office and shop employees before me, afraid of another collapse, moved their money to a bank that was safe and secure, to the bank that makes most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people of New York have become an expert in finance in the last few weeks.
A woman on the phone in the local goods store spoke about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if complaining to a Irish colleague.
And Lyn, the caretaker of my house has changed the subject of a uniformed 50-year-old house, not now talking about Brad and Angelina, or about my shipment, as we do.
He spoke to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my saved money in money market assets.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim graves were girded, while Austria reached the right hand side of Austria.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the right-wing Austrian Party of Freedom, and Filip Dewinter, from the Belgian Right Party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a protest in Antwerp on 17 January 2008, on the day on which the organisation "Vehicles Against the Island Space" was presented.
They have come up with signs that mimic traffic mirrors, which have described the mosques drawn through a red line.
According to the police, the extreme right-wing extremists are responsible for the debauchery of Muslim funerals in Austria, which took place on the same weekend when the far right-wing parties made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
There's more than 90 graves in a serious crash at the tranne cemetery next to Linz, sometime in the evening and this morning.
The perpetrators drew signs with a sprayer, such as a zeg star, on some graves, but the investigators said that they were trying to hide their extreme motives, arising from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be linked in any way to the elections.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic community told me that they were "very surprised" at the sound of the escalatory, which happened shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, the end of Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience test following yesterday's parliamentary elections in Austria, where the political balance-sheet has left the right.
The two right-wing parties, which received almost 30% of the votes, fought for the future of the Party of Freedom and the Association of Austria, for a strongly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were labeled by their critics as a hater.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the President of the Party of Freedoms who received more than 18% of the votes, has also expressed his disapproval of the campaign against the headsets and shells, as well as his alleged disapprove of foodstuffs with Islam.
At the final meeting of the party in Vienna, he spoke about the 'European Brotherhood', which will help prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both sides want to ban the construction of mosques and meres, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islam of Austria and Europe.
According to public opinion polls and analyses carried out directly after the elections leading to a better victory, the change was due to the majority of the young voting base, which are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a travel abroad.
Garry Glitter, a known rock star convicted of rape by children, has been banned from travelling in France and Spain by court.
The judges decided, after six months of banning Glitter, to inform the authorities of their intention to travel to Spain through France.
The Austrian police have received a ban on travel on Thursday after submitting evidence to the Court of Justice of cases of rape against children against Glitter.
Glitter, a real name of Paul Gadd, did not participate in the court of Ashford Magistrates in the field, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A referee of a court said: "On 25 September, on the day of Sunday, he filed an application from the Kent police to the Ashford Master's Court of Justice for the prevention of Paul Gadd's journey to France and Spain due on 25 March to prevent him from travelling to France and Spain.
"Paul Gadd didn't appear in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter informed the authorities of his intention to travel abroad because of the obligation to do so by the Act concerning the members of the register of sex offenders.
You should inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You must also notify the police at least seven days before the planned return.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years of imprisonment.
The municipal police have told me that they do not want to talk about specific cases and possible location of Glitter in Hungary.
We found out from the public spokesperson of the Kent police: "Kantin police is doing everything to protect children both within and abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to check someone if you do not leave the United Kingdom, because there is a comprehensive system here that allows us to manage the potential risks more effectively.
"The main task of the field police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we keep under constant control the behaviour of persons in the register of sex offenders and those living in the county in order to minimise the potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the rape of a 10 and 11-year-old girl.
After his leave, he flew to urchina, where he was supposed to fly over to a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he was feeling sick and refused to fly to London.
The local authorities did not pass the passport, so they flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow them to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where officials of the National Police and Immigration Office insisted on returning to Great Britain.
On 22 August, he arrived at Heathrow Airport 3 terminal, and remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to West London, Uxbridge, because, as requested by Scotland Yard, he was entered in the register of victims of sexual crime under a court order.
Glitter spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for the possession of photographs of child rape in the United Kingdom.
According to a source from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, rest assured and welcomed the fact that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on the stage because I want to present the artist from person" Günther Bauer Photographer Günther Bauer.
There's no formula, no hairdressing, no dance shoes.
From the Flamenco master's body, without the advantages of action: to get to know the ordinary faces of dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people are on the other hand.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except at the moments of an intimate, distant from the audience, when we can find a personal move, we can grasp the depth of a caught look, or we can look at the beauty of the unsolicited, but distinct hands of an artist who is not ready to perform a stage performance.
In his photo gallery of the German Günther Bauer Flamenco- People, the theatre of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this not-so-known site of masters.
Through the photo, the specific iconography of the Falmenco is presented in different aspects.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco's Photo Month, 'reflects the international importance of Flamenco day by day', considers it to be the creator, adding that the Flamenco People could be any player, since the image shows that these images do not typically represent the pictures.
These people on the street are artists who are able to take passion, divinity, joy to the stage... and rob the audience.
On the other hand, stage photography is not suitable to grasp their personality.
Their personality and character dwells at the very bottom of their beings.
I wanted to create an inner atmosphere that would allow me to inherit the personality of the giants of the Flameno with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival started its long journey in 1997, with a record camera in which portraits of Flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers were made.
Thanks to this camera and the theme selection, these portraits quote fake photography.
However, the application of the different stylistic tools breaks with the traditional image representation and suggests the present. The following thought truly reflects the idea of the flaming: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes from day to day and is always impressive."
It's not the dance, it's not the singing or the music itself, it's the artist's character, it's the character of the audience.
These days, the main feature of the works that can be seen in the El Unseen Gallery is the search for the essence of the encounter with the artistic spell, which can be seen through perception, existence and visualization.
The known figures of Falmenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Moreente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, commemorate this photo collection of 60 artists.
The project has also become a flamenco antigen, which will soon be published with an album containing the posts presented at the exhibition.
His passion for the portraits was repeated two years ago by the series "Sport Art Project" ('Sport Art Project').
Although the concept of Flamenco- People differs a lot from that, the photographer adds: "I love to photograph people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or later moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult work of photography is the portrait.
People you meet, people you meet, people you meet, people you sometimes don't know, people you only want a few minutes to take pictures of.
But even under these circumstances, as a photographer, I have always tried to accomplish my ideas.
An exhibition selected from the portraits of the modern Flamenco- People's Office, entitled "Flamenco- People", will be held in the "Calle de la Mata" 20 in Alameda de Härcules until 16 October.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he's working on is "created courage".
The scene and the action are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing a new novel. The novel’s main character is an Irish nationalist, Roger Csón, who lived in the Congo for 20 years and was also in the Amazonian region.
A potential writer for the Literary Nobel Prize last night at the Hay Festival Segovia event admitted that his current work is "a solid conviction" and "all evidence indicates that there is no need to write" the novel.
"If I was smarter, I wouldn't, but I will, and I hope that I will do so at some point in time," - he ended his talk with these words at the festival of thought, thought and opinion, which, for four days in the city of Aqueduct, received the hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors.
The author of "City and dogs" was one of the most outstanding participants in the Literary Festival, and he also had the potential to succeed.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, a new edition of Dickens' "Our Common Friend" novel.
A devoted audience received the welcome of Felix Romeo. It quickly came to light for the audience, during which the author of Peru explained with an amazing memory and a great amount of humor how his passion for reading developed from a special adventure and his desire for life; how he overcomes the lack of inspiration with a well-reviewed written method, regular documentation, many repairs and rewrites; how his many authoric calls were Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexand Dumas, and what monuments were built upon.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to assess or to show whether books change our lives, but added: "I don't think that literature is a mere entertainment or a social experience," since it has an impact on people and makes them think, so he asked the writers not to allow the seduction of simplicity and to take responsibility for their profession.
Due to the current weather, the Pozoblanco good, the horsebacking bullfights, too, will be missed.
The horse bullfight, which was traditionally held as the closing times of the Pazoblanco Festivals, was cancelled yesterday morning after the upcoming horse-ridors found the arena scene to be unusable for the war.
Consequently, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to abstain from the bullfight.
The weather tensions greatly ravaged the ceremony series, as two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the second bull fight was left due to the rain.
The future leading players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have had a fight with Castilblanco's bulls.
So they had a bike fight on Fridays only.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who took three ears home as a trophy, and he was taken round shoulder by shoulder after a sophisticated and esthetic battle.
At the same time, by two bulls of Alejandro Talavante, he received a single ear as a trophy and a number of confessions, but this was due to the audience rather than to his own performance.
After that, El Juli followed, who contributed little to the aging of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
After a comfortable ride with the second bull, most of the audience managed to get it out of the row.
He knew that a two-ton hasy truck was trying to escape from road inspection.
Four hours and fifty minutes in the morning.
The Nordic Regional Police are carrying out traffic checks in the territory of Armiñón (Nalava).
The authority will stop a vehicle in which two passengers are travelling, and passengers will try to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hakis, was not noticeable at the same time.
The detectives have taken down the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J. - reported by the B.C.I.'s Home Affairs Department.
The man in custody is accused of drug trafficking and document counterfeiting.
The case was carried out in the territory of Armiñón, where the staff of the Álavai Revolutionary Authority carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the truck, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas and then left the control site.
The detectives took him under surveillance, and then the vehicle stopped a few miles away from the resting distance and its passengers fled from the highway towards a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally caught one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily branded truck, he booked its shipment of 2178 kilograms of belly.
The police forces are forced to conduct a more thorough investigation and to measure the drug in order to fill the rear part of the vehicle.
In addition, the inspection has shown that the vehicle's false plate number does not correspond to the information contained in the vehicle's papers and therefore a procedure is also initiated against the person arrested for falsification of a document.
The Basque Regional Police continue their investigation into the purpose of arresting another suspect, who, as we have mentioned, fled the highway and, on the other hand, to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A. J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and within a few hours judicial action was started.
She has been arrested because she was being treated under the influence of a medicine called Heather Locklear.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend by the police in Santa Bar (California) because it was under the influence of a medicine.
According to a witness, he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with a series of many maneuvers - he reported to the People magazine as one of the spokespersons for traffic supervision in California.
According to the witness, around 16 o'clock 30, Locklear hit the gas to the floor, hurled the engine, tried to leave the parking lot in advance and backwards, and went back and forth the next day."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who probably never recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also warned the police 'cause he was worried about the life of Lockear.
When the police arrived, the actress was in her car, which partially paralyzed the highway traffic.
"It seemed like a mess", so the patrols took him to a specialized center for drugs and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was immediately excluded, and the speaker also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, they thought she was under the influence of a medicine called Locklear.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified agent, transported to the local prison at 19 hours, where he was released a few hours later.
Locklear came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago when his anxiety and depression were wired.
Llamazares calls on the Association of the U.S. (United Left) of the Andalus Federation of the United States of America to deal with the Silva case.
Mr Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the representative of the United Left today stated that the Regional Federation of the Republic of Seville will decide on the case of former youth and sport councillor of the City of Seville, Mr. Silva.
"In these things, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is indeed within the competence of the Andalusian organization", Llamazares pointed out the procedure to be applied by the party to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the Committee stressed that, in detecting any irregularities that Silva might have committed, "transparency" should be kept in mind: "AtU has always been careful to ensure maximum transparency in matters of this kind."
He added that training is part of "the strict ethical code for civil servants as well."
"Small blood", the epic work of Garci.
He was inspired by José Luis Garci, who inspired the Spanish to rise up in May blood, which, with its budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest work of his cinematography.
Accordingly, the director, in his work as a novelist, tried to illustrate the mass flood and social analysis that he has always admired, and today, with the company of Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the public audience of the actors.
More than two and a half-hours of Mayan blood will be presented on Friday in the cinema, and later on it will be measured as a miniature of the Telemadrid for four more hours.
This is due to Esperanza Aguirre's father, José Luis Garci, the great admirer of Galdó's literature, who created his childhood dream of filming. This was due to Esperanza Aguirre, who had entrusted him three years ago with the province of Madrid to draw up a monument for the 200th anniversary of the events in Madrid on May 2nd. Garci accepted the request on condition that the story was based on the National Events.
The 15 million budget was entirely made available by the Land of Madrid's Autonomous Community, and Garc was given a special opportunity: he could present "the disturbed Spaniards who were wrongly against the bad leader, because the struggle for independence has brought the country to a huge loss by the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
The director, however, expressed his regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms that were more than doubled in May blood. Therefore, he was forced to skip some of the scenes from the scenario, which, like many other times, are recorded together with Horacio Vacárcés.
So the director of the Recommendation turned to his usual way of working, and he used the actors he started to play with before filming. Casting wasn't, because Garci thought it was "magic", and because, as he said, "The director's art is part of the theatre and the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we work in."
Several observers of May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not first come to the front of their camera.
Garci - who can be proud of four awards and an award - believes that candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, namely, the blood of May, the billiard table of seven France and the one who was finally chosen for the Single Sun, do not represent the young generation of the Spanish cinema, "where it should be presented," said he.
Garci's film doesn't charge you for any of this.
"You think you're working for the afterlife, and you realize that only luck counts, and you're finally happy to have another movie done," Garci says, "and a 30-year-old professional career behind him."
She recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola.
A Seville flamenco dancer also commemorates a Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola, from the Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the Andalus mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela) moved to London when she was born in the Triana quarter and three years old.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in Eastern dances.
During his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for women's justice, either Isodora Duncan, Virginia Wolof or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and was fighting against the wear of a protection against the freedom of women's movement.
An esthetic and esthetic revolution erupted in a war-world, and his life fascinated him.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gambo, he recommended to me a Tórtola, whose character really impressed me."
The flamingo dancer said: "It is not our goal to share his life's life, but to capture his soul.
I was reminded of the titles of his titles: flammenco styles.
For example, the "pilango dance" of Guaji or the "pire dance" of the tango is the "tango" of Guaji.
"He danced sensibly and, otherwise, it is my style," he says.
Two extraordinary contributors highlight the light of the performance: Miguel Poveda, after the open door, now sings again in the performance of Isabel; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with a former disciple.
"Totil today, the older Tórtola, the mature woman, is shaped by the older Tórtola.
I'm glad you said yes to that request, I am very pleased to be performing in my piece."
In addition, Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga musical directors and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Moón; El Pajaro bat, Rafa El Viola brács, and Juanfr Juárez, who "plays a permanent character with the true diva style."
The piece also shows much of the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and then comes to places far away, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to make a memory of him because his personality had a major impact on his own age, but these days he is no longer known and even appreciated for his work," he says.
The performance will begin at 30 p.m. tonight at the Lope de Vega Theatre at 20:00 p.m.
At the end of Triennium, the "A Log of a Freshly Remarced Poetry" will appear.
The first illustrated edition of a recent poet's journal will be presented at St. Stephen's Church (New York), where in May 1916 Juan Ramón Jiménez married Musica. The presentation is part of the programme entitled Zenobia and Juan Simonon Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the cultural committee of the Andalus Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Literary Nobel Prize and the anniversary of their death.
Thus, the closing times of the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium are the re-issues of this work, the restoration of the International Union in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's monument and the "Juan Ramón Jénez: The bright summer" exhibition. This May this year, the exhibition was open, with several and more provinces of Andalus and is scheduled to visit New York City for the time of the International Federation.
The Andalus Regional Government's Committee for Culture has received a total of eight hundred copies of the journal of a newly-reeled poet, published by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most multi-stakeholder poets in the Netherlands.
Even without Paul Newman, America is not so attractive.
"God sometimes makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was like him."
The reference is made to Sally Field, an actress who worked with Newman in the movie "The Victims of Sensation", and reflects the shock and inviolability caused by Newman's death in American cinema and in the whole of America.
Of course, he's had a hard time getting the car.
It expired in 2007,
and is known to be ill,
but his death still rockes everyone.
"Sometimes it is impossible to express our feelings, and I have now lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, among other things, "to have made my life better and this country better."
No one was afraid that he might become ridiculous or get overreacted.
One of the heroes of the cinema and home left in a particularly dark period, protected by the fear of terrorism and market relations, by the desperate search of American self-esteem and dignity.
When these are difficult times and many easily lose their virtues and remain very few people we can look up to, you don't have to be Luis Cerne to thank Paul Newman.
In the eyes of people, he embodys the theory of beauty and philosophy in the plátói.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and protector of lost and lost cases, from the anti-drug foundation created in memory of his firstborn son who died of drug overdose until the creation of his organic organic brand.
It was a noble gift to a country that was hard to overcome in its own suicide-trembling culture.
The glamorous wave of wonder has gone all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last last Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says he's not a man, but a time has died with him.
Another English prized Sam Mendes stated that his joint work with Newman was a clear highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspiration in the world.
"He has made the light very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who may be one of the few who today tries to follow Paul Newman's way of life: they eliminate honesty and serious and distant privacy.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the context of today's media jungle.
Yet, there are those who try, and Paul Newman is the symbol of it.
He once divorced, but after 50 years of faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward, although he certainly would have had many opportunities for infidelity.
"Why eat other hamburgers if the meat is waiting at home?" - He was serious.
In heaven, you can be proud that the daughters of the earth are also a fan, which in America is not very common.
"One of his many forms was as proud as a faithful husband, a loving father, a caring grandfather and a devoted human-friendly role", he says.
Madridian Olympics are going on a bad road.
The dream of many of us is a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 failed, it may become 2016.
But I'm asking you, are you really up to it?
Because if we start out of the race last night, I guess not at all.
It was called a competition, but in my view, it was the worst of all the many I've ever been to.
It's a matter of substance, and if you had to be evaluated once, and I'd be the investigator, it would be a clear failure.
But let's go in line and start at the beginning.
Inconsistency started with the takeover of the number, since this had to be done earlier than before.
This is not, in fact, a problem, but if you go faster, at least get it all at once (including chips, avoid working later).
That's not what happened.
First of all, only the number was handed over (the first nonsense, only to go there soon) and (after normal line work) how surprising it was only the S-shirt (the second nonsense, since I had XL size).
Do we live in a world in which we live?
Or because of the crisis, have they decided to save money and only get cheaper, small-sized shirts?
But anyway, these things are still a little midget compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Besides taking over the chip at a terrible early stage, it took 15 minutes from arrival and even the backpack had to be dropped.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race of over 11,000 people.
So, as was expected, the competition started, and we haven't given up our backpacks yet, and when we did, that was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made more pleasant the more than 40 years of waiting for the people to rise and stand attempts to attack.
I think that by tomorrow we'll get about 500 sure pneumonia, and some of them, including themselves, will not be able to get us a position at the actual time.
If you asked me about the perfect racer, I wouldn't think of that by any chance.
I guess we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Search for the Microsoft (virtual) reception site.
At the MIT Emerging Technology Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence which, however, is capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle operating within the company) based on the information from the conversation.
This "reception" is a camera and a format and facial recognition system to identify how many people are in the room, who they - and also remember what they wear - and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, on the basis of discussions, you can group the present persons.
During the interview, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she is not a member of the company that talks with her and is not an employee of the company.
He will ask if he has come to visit someone and will make sure that he will soon be able to help you.
All of this without the blue big screen.
Fascinating.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
Currently, the company has a major role to play, such as the development of a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people found out that Microsoft has become a strategy.
Windows 7 will become smaller and contain less co-financed programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were to run the necessary programs instead of a lot of garbage, then the machines would be five times the size - bravo, Steve, that's something.
An invented ESA has been invented, considering that the Microsoft has so far attached additional features and extra features to Windows in all new versions.
The change of direction is reversed.
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming increasingly entrenched, and the software itself is also important.
When Google Chrome appeared on the web, I joined the theory that Google took the first step to become a Windows competitor.
It is often well known that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, since it is an essential element of the hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but account must be taken of the "death" of the operating system, not absolute, but relatively.
Mr Baller's statement at this point supports this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more to the web browser.
The computer is only being turned on to open the Firefox or explorer - or Chrome - and more and more of the time spent browsing than we do in the world of windows.
What is the main part of the system-related applications?
Less is more than that.
And Windows 7 is less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less stressed, less complicated.
The aim of Microsoft is to integrate its services more on-line and, in the end, to provide an alternative to Google.
They all need to be, I'll give you an example of why.
This photo was taken in Redmond in a lounge designed for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A poster on the soda machine calls on them to use the company's browser. "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent investigation found that 66% of the Microsofters used Google to browse online.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also announced last week.
Not in early 2009, but in the end, rather in 2010.
The Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 into the common market.
After all, the mobile phone is starting to function as a computer.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will certainly ruin their business.
Le Faraquex Marcel
He was wearing Pablo Picasso on the diamond of Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Blood, Al Pacino on the crossroads of Francis Ford Coppola, and this is also one of the basic clothes of the gay public.
And as long as we're on the list of specialities, we can also recall the private figure of the Migrant Crescent Crescent Crescent mustard weightlifter.
But what are we talking about? Nothing other than, typically, narrow and unsightly, a man from cotton stripes.
That is, "tank", as the English people call it, but with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles, none of his competitors can compete.
First of all, because of his name - although some people call it only "Marcel" - which is due to sport, he was named after Marcel Cerdan's boxer, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
The Marcel is made of excellent cotton, custom customization, specific emblem and competition from its competitors because of the small (under-recognition) Belgian flag. The latter is carried by the most typical models hidden in the T-shirt’s arm.
However, the Belgian Government does not only produce tank products.
Sporters, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool shorts, travel jackets, baby coats, tops - and you can count - are all part of the company's products.
And they're all part of the category of convenience,
Although it is also regrettable that they should be worn as underwear.
That's too good.
"I'd like to be a young mom; no matter who the father is."
He is very similar to his brother, but he was able to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but full of energy.
Currently, the Cruz-sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means much more than some pretty and beautiful girls give their names to something.
It was present in the promotion of Mango's new Paris headquarters and the transfer of the Spanish company's most sponsored fashion fees.
He's getting a warm and gentle bowl of it.
In fact, what are you doing in Paris?
We are presenting Mango's new autumn-win collection, which we planned with my brother, Penelope. In addition, we are participating in the second round of Mango Fashion Awards and Valentino's honorary lunch at the Opera.
It's a rather dense day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is the season of the season at Mango. Where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
Let's pray for movies in the '50s and '60s; that's where we took over a lot of stuff.
And then, many times, I just walk around the city and watch women dress, change and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite posts.
You work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a versatile woman, aren't you?
That's what I think, but after all, these three things are related, because they have a lot in common.
When I was a kid, I was interested in clothes, and I was looking forward to seeing my grandmother and hiding in my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you on Canaan, and she almost got up with a theme park.
And then as a dancer, I've always tried to look out for my clothes.
You know, we dancers like to make up our own style for lessons and rehearsals, to have a good time looking in the mirror.
And in the role of actress, you'll truly be your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's all connected to everything, and all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You've recently celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no, no, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women are really worth it, they've had enough experience and they've made less mistakes in life.
The biological clock does not concern you.
Since I was a kid, I've been doing what I'm comfortable with, and it's making me very happy.
Do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I really want to be a young mother, and I certainly don't want to miss that.
And as for the future, it doesn't matter who it is.
In joy and great love to raise my child.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year you filmed more movies that they haven't even introduced.
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to coming out.
I, the one who started in the theater, I am very distrustful and restless, I want everything immediately, but I know that this is impossible.
I look forward to showing you the last hour and the search for the grave of the Christ.
I wonder how you feel about them...
Well, I'm sure you've been debuting on the outskirts with Naomi Camp a couple of days ago.
Well, no, that's not true...
I didn't go up on the runway as I did.
Naomi Campbell has known and simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which was directed by her own women for a better world, and I have chosen two of my own Mango collections. The clothing presented was auctioned and the amount was offered to Naomi NGO.
People don't even know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so many things about him, and I know it, and I'll make sure that half of it isn't true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of his activity.
You asked me for no reason, but if you wanted me to stand on your head, I'd do that too.
If women in the third world are to bets, I don't know what's impossible.
The returnee leaders will be required to install "Alcolock".
The Ministry of Home Affairs would require a car to be fitted after three DUI infringements to prevent the launch of a vehicle if the driver is in or does not enter the vehicle.
The proposal was submitted in June, and the Public Prosecutor's Office is now dealing with it, according to which the pilot project will last one year.
Since the project is intended to be restored to circulation, the car driver must also participate in a rolling course on road education.
In addition to the Directorate-General for Transport, the experiment will include DGT and FITSA.
According to the statistics, 30-7% of drivers who have been arrested on a regular basis for DUI are reintroduced from 30-7% of drivers.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol content of the air inhaled air. If it is greater than the permitted level, or if the driver has not entered the device at all, the system does not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument with more than EUR 1000 would be a violation of the rules.
A study carried out in the United States of America in 2007 has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments may reduce the number of infringements by up to 65 % in the first year after the installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people per year could be saved by this rule.
For two reasons, the measure focuses on infringements: on the one hand, it makes it easier to prevent them from becoming a criminal,
Furthermore, it is simpler to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the usual medium, while the necessary criminal reform requires a fundamental legislative amendment.
The instrument is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which, by the French model, calls for the system to be included in school buses.
In Mexico, closed shoes, with closed shoes and shoes in closed shoes, in Mexicans, in closed shoes, in closed shoes, in closed shoes, in closed shoes, in closed shoes and
In English, at 17:00, at 40 p.m., the Spanish air force transporter from Asturias to the Prince's Party of Asturias landed at the presidential hangar of the airport of Benito Juárez in the city of Helsinki.
The sun was already on its way down, but it was still so hot that we could only see the king's party out of the flight using the hand as an impersonator.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other prominent personalities stood.
A few hours before I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the couple from Spain would arrive in the city on official visits.
Well, then, there will be no airport transfer for a long time today... ..the woman is from here or something...
- No, sir, the lady is a lady, she just lived here a few years ago.
- Yeah, or like...
But the Mexican press, that's all you know about the Asturias County Party and the importance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting for the airport hangar at the red carpet, at the time of the 27 Marines, who serve the protection of the vicars.
The Prince appears smiling, in blue and blue clothes, and the Queen, in her long hair, the wind gets hit in her long hair, in a retreaded fridge, but not in the usual toes- they may have warned about the storms of the city.
They stop for a moment and smile at the cameras and then enter the room where the official reception comes.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, they are waiting for a reporter of one of the Mexican word-satellite ports in Mexico.
The most valuable priced fee is a fee.
The best place to give a fashion prize to the world is definitely Paris, and of the fashion designers living today, it is the most sophisticated and most definitely the most sophisticated of all.
Mango has recently launched the second tender for El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to promote the international introduction of young talent from the fashion industry.
The main fee is EUR 30 million.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first invitation to tender, saw his own design clothes in the Mango exhibition under the Paris Boulevard Haussmann 54, and made a little easier on access.
By the way, this company's second largest European business and recently opened 1335 square meters.
It is located in the largest business district.
We finally found ourselves at the Garnier Opera in Paris in the middle of the events and the thank-yous to Valentino for his meeting in the jury.
In the company of the most beautiful Chagalok, the presidential table prepared by Mango of the Garage has shown even more clearly.
Nati, whose brother recently died, came with a heavy heart and grief, wearing one of the Company's pieces and some of the breathtaking jewels of ELAH. With nearly two feet tall sons of Luis, he accompanied Valentine to the main table of his evening in honor.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, was entertaining the guests. Baron Rotchil was so friendly at the university that they eventually missed a suit because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came into the store in his own planned pants and shirts, and at dinner he wore a sexy long black dress. At night's opera visit, Gaya Toledo got so involved in the ballet room that, recalling the old days, he slipped over to one of the bars and took a grand plie-likeness.
Inés Sastre did not attend the palace visit, but he showed some photos of his son on his cell phone in front of him.
And John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Inn in Paris the next day. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he was well informed that he would not ask for any smell in the room.
Stars under the curse of the stars.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1001, the number of stress absorbers is 100, the number of stress absorbers.
Not 1000, but 1000 and one way to turn off the chaotic and dim everydays.
Good news is that we can all find them in a single book that arrives at the bookstore on 30 September to bring peace with you.
It's almost panting at 7 o'clock in the morning, but it's even more important to think about how fast the day of the world is turning into a life of speed.
Her name is tension, and her computer is back pain.
The stress is a public disease of the 21st century.
But overcoming day-to-day fatigue and overcoming problems at work is not one or two ways to overcome it.
No, this number is exactly 1001 equal to the number.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or "spa" treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in his book so that everyone can find a solution that can be adapted to the best possible and free moments.
The stress relief work bears the address of 1001 relaxation method and the shocking calm from Pearson Alhambra y DK comes to the bookstore from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher.
If you are convinced that the world of work or personal relationships will at least eliminate the stress, this article will certainly hinder you in your faith.
It also has other ideas that help to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are already too low to refresh your body and become a central problem in your stress life, it is time to stay in the chair, relax and focus on reading only.
Those who talk in their dreams.
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not thinking about those who get upset and who are completely aware of what happened to them that day, but about those who talk while sleeping.
At first, the phenomenon may seem scary, but in fact it is absolutely harmless.
This benevolent sleep disorder is called somniloquism.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
You must have told more of them that you spoke last night.
It can be entirely rhosody (e.g. only once in a high - fever disease) or more common (days, weeklys or monthlys) and generally the next day the child will not know anything about anything.
The appearance of a single trigger cannot be reversed for a single trigger.
It often comes with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night anxiety, night-time bed-bed problems (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As has been mentioned, a high-fever condition, or a stress or elevated mood condition may be accompanied by a condition called stress.
In any case, they have studied it a little so far.
The volume of speech is also very variable.
It can be quiet, calm, it can be uninterrupted in words and mingling, but unlike this, it may also be expressed in the form of screaming, crying or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and contact a specialist. The investigation may reveal whether or not there is a problem in the background causing some major anxiety and may provide solutions.
As mentioned above, there is no way of knowing, unless it comes with another manageable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
There are some things we can do, however, here is a bouquet of preventive measures:
Note that the child should remain calm before going to bed.
Choose calm games and avoid the child from watching alarming or aggressive TV programmes or series.
Children who are prone to nervousness or who are more likely to relax will be taught some relaxing methods to find inner rest easier.
This will help the child to sleep more peacefully.
However, if you start to talk while sleeping, let's try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and the next day they won't remember anything.
Useful Councils
Do not wake the child up.
It would be ridiculous, because the child is unconscious, but he would get out of sleep.
Despite his talk, he actually keeps sleeping and resting.
Remember, if you are accompanied by several intense anxietys, you are recommended to visit a specialist or to discover what causes the child to become a major anxiety.
If you speak plainly (the rarest time), do not start asking questions about finding out anything from him.
It wouldn't be necessary, because while sleeping, it's not conscious enough to collect his thoughts.
On the other hand, you only hear the speech, but do not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the hearers and possible conclusions.
Don't tell the child that they'll be able to question his secrets the other night.
Not even a joke.
This causes a great deal of distress.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless time.
The Illhaeusern is right on line right now.
After a long takeoff, Illhaeusern's team finally took a new impetus and won again on its home course.
Although there was no wild game, the yellow and blacks were once again in a situation, one of which was finally won.
The fight was not too tight, as the attackers had a hard time detecting the right rhythm.
The first gate was shot by the captain of the reception team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball was only affected by the upper corner of the gate. Illhaeusern then was taken over and followed by the shots: Fonderflick was shot with a long shot, and Hirin's shot was taken over by the gate. Romain splinter, and Diebold also tried to stop Dannemarie from stopping by a long-range attempt.
On the other side, players in a block fought to defend the middle course, and only the riahi, the imaginant, was in a shooting position.
The beginning of the second half promised decisively: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on Dannemarie's side. Immediately thereafter, the first goal was born: After the first shooting of Debbold, the nyhaserni Marais acquired the ball with an excellent position and then delivered it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern's messenger could not have enjoyed the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the course, so his team members had to continue to fight in human background.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, was unable to benefit from this advantage: they did not cause a lot of problems for the home team, who just pulled back a little bit to secure their protection.
He meets with those who are angry with him.
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkosy makes an outlandish flight to Easttagne.
On Monday, a visit by fishermen has paralysed the traffic of several Bretons and Norwegian ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic has decided to visit the Port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protestors.
The latter promised that the President would be received in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that the "specific" of Sarkozy would be received by means of proposals.
The president's meeting is in line with the meeting of the "Education Committee" created by breton fishermen with the aim of taking action against the rise in the price of gas, as the price exceeded the record price of EUR 1.14 per litre.
David Martinon, spokesperson of the President of the Republic, says that the President will "negotiate with the fishermen on how to help companies recover their competitiveness and make the terms and conditions of employment and rent safer for the members of the staff."
The fishermen look forward to the arrival of Nicolas Franchet.
On Tuesday mornings in Morbihan and Calvados districts were given marketing visits, with which nearly 10 km of congestion was created.
He was also paralyzed by the transport of the yacht transport by the Lake Briberon, but the roads to Belle-Le have not been blocked.
Roadblocks have been set up on the Brittany Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors have already shown their determination. Then at dawn, rubber tyres and pallets were set up in front of the fuel tankers of the Brest ports, while protests took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further attacks in other ports of the Atlantic and La Manche. In Vendée County Sables d'Olonne, for example, the fishermen did not board the ship, while in Le Havre, there were about 20 ships that prevented trade in goods.
La Turballe and Le Croisic’s fishermen in the Loire-Atlantique district have eliminated the huge oil refinery block of Total in Donges in the evening.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held in the Ministry by deciding on the next steps.
In Le Guilvinec, on Tuesday, the "Censure Committee" should decide on its next step and participation at the meeting scheduled at the Paris Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the Head of the National Fisheries Committee, as the Committee did not support its efforts.
"The strike will continue", because "the fishermen will not allow themselves to go to Paris" and "not to go to Paris", he announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but believe that the operation of a ship would only be profitable if the price of the oil per litre fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The original Paul Newman
"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" are an unforgettable titler at the home of Connectcutu at 83 years of age because of death, cancer, and cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes also paid tribute to the cinema legend and profession of the 83-year-old, Paul Newman.
Embraer will not change its 2008 transport plans.
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian exporting company is planning to transport 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the fourth largest manufacturing company in the world, can keep plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirm Fredrico Fleury Curado, President of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a large proportion of the Chinese market, especially for aircraft with 30-120 seats.
Embraer has transported a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers in the last eight years.
More than 15% of the assets of AIG's sales are more than 15 % of the assets of AIG's sales.
American International Company, which has been brought back by the U.S. financial authorities, wishes to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay its amount of USD 85 billion - reported the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to internal life insurance and civil insurance activities, AIG would separate a large part of all other branches of AIG’s business - explained the newspaper which quoted funds close to the case.
According to the information provided by the Order, AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine the possibility of selling.
It does not confirm this information.
The assets intended to be sold by AIG include the aircraft-lease company International Lase Financial Corporation, the transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company’s share of 59 %, and its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments - added by the Times.
However, according to the newspaper, the final decision is not yet related to sales.
AIG needs to be able to recover a loan of USD 85 billion approved by the United States Government quickly, thereby taking the risk of becoming 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders on a corresponding basis.
A historical study of the Ming Meeting history of the Ming Meeting meeting.
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic decline on Monday, after the Senate rejected Paulson's rescue plan. The Dow's index fell by 6.98% (which never saw an almost 800-point decrease), and Nasdaq by 9.14%.
The Dow© Industrial Average index (DJIA) is sinking at 77,7 points, so it closes at 10 35,5 points.
The largest decrease in the index (68.81 points) so far was registered on 17 September 2001, when the trade started again after the terrorist attack on 11 September 2011.
Nasdaq 199,61, based mainly on technological papers, was closed at 1 983,73 points, while the expanded index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 decreased to 1 106 points by 8.8% (with 106 points) according to official closing data.
The stock exchange on the street was already weak at the opening, and when the Senate suddenly rejected the rescue plan to restore market balance, it began to take low-flight flights.
Members rejected 228 'no' votes against 205 'yes' to the provision of funds requested by Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance.
Almost two-thirds of the Republicans fought the plan.
"From this market, the market is screening the wrong signs, because it seems that it is unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial Analyst of FTN.
"It seems from this, however much the market may have added to this plan," he added, and expressed his concern that if they adopted such a plan a few days later, it would be "too late".
"If the plan is actually condemned (...), then it will be on Fed (American central bank - the goods.) and on the other central banks to manage the crisis and the terms and conditions of the loan will continue to tighten" - warns Mr.
The need to further strengthen the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "Every day, another and another financial institution goes bankrupt" in the United States.
After the collapse of the Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities have made sure that Wachovia’s banking companies are acquired by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated, which has taken urgent measures to rescue banks in the United Kingdom, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the market has been "not only an American but also a global crisis", adds FTN's Financial Analyst.
The bond market has experienced a significant recovery in the bond market.
The introduction of a ten-year-old bond decreased from 3.827% to 3.62% on the evening of the evening, and the 30-year-old decreased from 4.357% on the previous day to 4.16.16%.
The winner won the first two-letter match.
On Friday, the first debate of the two U.S. presidents was followed by another one that had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would be released from the duel as a winner.
Not surprisingly, both the Republican and the Democratic campaign leaders have said to themselves that they have won in the media match that took place in the context of a third of the American households.
According to the German political analyst, although John McCain's performance was honorable, it did not prove to be sufficiently "creative" to stop his audience from falling: studies carried out five weeks before the presidential election proved this.
According to Gallup, the Democrat candidate is better in the fight: according to the results of the public opinion poll published on Saturday, Obma has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49% respectively).
Among the most important, yet unsolved voters, 39% of the respondents say Obama will win, while 25% of them expect McCain to win, according to a survey conducted by CBS.
Obama is expected to further increase her advantage by her partner, Joseph Biden's great Thursday performance, preparing for Biden's first and only public debate with her rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He has good instincts."
The McCain in his seventies never fails to give priority to his own undisputably huge foreign policy experience, but he also stresses his opponent's "navity" in these matters, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"So, Senator Obama doesn't understand that..." said the attack several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidential position" - said McCain.
This is the main attack surface used by Republican TV advertising since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represented the future.
He did not let himself be embarrassed: he was confused and well-worded.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore a picture of the United States of America in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama does now" - he cut back the democratic ad sent this weekend, pointing to the Republican leader's eye that he still hasn't perceived the impact of the crisis on the American people of "the street".
"During the 50 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of comments about me, but nothing about you" said Obama yesterday in front of 20 thousand people who gathered in a rain in North Carolina for the election meeting.
He didn't even say the words "intermediate" or "workers" in his mouth, and the confusing situation in the financial world certainly favours Obama, whom the Americans think is the best way to save the economy at the end of the collapse.
"The next week may prove to be a turning point," said Charles Schumer yesterday, the powerful democratic senator.
According to a veteran from the Clinton government, Rahm Emanuel, President of the Democratic Party, Obama has "in the economic sphere" as well as Bill Clinton at the time of the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the democratic president, the current crisis is "the final judgment over the eight-year evil economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain."
The Seinois senator reaffirmed that despite the fluctuations in the stock exchange, it will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that its primary objectives include creating the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
On the other hand, it plans to establish 45 nuclear power plants until 2030.
However, both of the presidents have approached with caution the questions relating to the bank rescue plan of USD 700 billion (EUR 470 billion): the extremely unbelieving plan was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was a choice here?"
On Sunday evening, young people and opposition protested at the capital square of the capital of Belarus to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after closing the polling rooms, hundreds of Belarusians gathered at Minsk's headquarters to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although the results have not been published yet, many young protesters protested against President Alexandr Lukasenko with the following words: "Mr. Doctor, resign!".
Some admit that they didn't even go to vote, "Why would I go? They're doing what they want to do with my vote anyway!" said a young man.
The protestors do not believe that the regime, which has tried to express itself in front of foreign observers in order to communicate with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic change of system.
If the elections were to be considered clean, observers could release the country's sanctions, under which 40 Belarusian leaders refused visas and some bank accounts were frozen.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not proceed clearly.
"We were held away from the electoral committees, and our members could not participate in the vote counting," said Yuri Potyemkin, a spokesperson of the twelve parties, so that he is a very heterogeneous American Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were only nominal" - stresses Aleksandr Miinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The main thing is to charge the votes, and in this case, this executive power.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, that means that they have been appointed and not elected.
But their access to Parliament allows them to have a place in the television, to meet in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take part in political life because "the dialogue with the European Union should be promoted".
In fact, if our seriously indebtedness economy against Russia is going to be in crisis and we are unable to renew, we are expected to be under the jurisdiction of Russia.
But we will be independent."
The opposition fears that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation, which follows the process of election, will adopt the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate seems too high and that the widespread organisation of the preliminary vote (which was attended by 26% of the voters in Minsk) has enabled any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was a choice?" - asks the question of the Social Democratic leader of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was last released from prison this August of the year for the last time in which he was arrested as a political prisoner.
No one in the polling rooms was present.
In Parliament, up to five members of the opposition will enter, namely those who are the most appropriate to the leadership.
The October square is once again the silence of the night is dark.
On Tuesday, President Lukasenko and members of the Central Election Committee will succeed.
The blood is re-safe in the blood.
Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate yesterday's celebration of Hema-Québec's 10th anniversary, because today Hema-Québec has become one of the world's safest and most efficient sacrificial companies in the world.
Most importantly, you have managed to regain people's trust, which has severely thwarted the scandal associated with infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood vessels managed by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Service were infected in the 1980s with the immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses.
In February 1994, following the drama and the general demise, the Government of the Republic of China launched an official investigation under the leadership of Horace Kover, which was designed to highlight the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid similar cases in the future.
While the long-term report by Judge Kover has been submitted, some provinces have set up their own committees aimed at designing a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this task.
As a result of the Gélinee and Kever reports, two blood suppliers were set up in Canada: one is Hema-Québec, who served Quebec, and the other is the Canadian Blood Carrier Company, who is responsible for all the rest of the provinces and the supply of the two territories.
"When the Hema-Quebec started its activity in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system" - remembers Dr. Décary.
The situation was surprising.
"In the coming years, however, we have managed to restore people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in this area." Decary proudly states that in early 2008 nearly 94% of the people in Quebec considered the Hema-Québet to be reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that "trust is a very fragile matter of trust.
He has applied the principle of prudence since Hema-Québec was founded on 28 September 1998.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe where the new species of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the doctor, who has been running the company since its establishment in 1998, has also been infected with the disease in Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
"We had no idea that this disease was spreading through blood.
That is why we are relying on one of the most important recommendations of the Krevér and Gélineau reports. This means that if we are uncertain in this case and there is a risk of serious illness, we need to apply exclusion measures. In this case, it was about the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that causes brain damage, which inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999 we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since then.
A few years ago, it was undoubtedly determined that the disease spreads through blood.
This case convinced us that we had reason to apply the principle of prudence."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows a much more sensitive diagnosis of the HIV virus. This nucleic acid test (NAT), which is capable of detecting the virus directly in the blood of donors, rather than antibodies to the virus, on which the previously used samples were derived.
With the help of the NAT test, we could shorten the trial period that lasts from infection until we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical devices - explains the expert.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, they significantly reduce the risk of blood transfusions infecting the blood and not being able to be detected outside of knowledge.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of spreading AIDS by blood transfusions.
Today, 12 million people are at risk of getting blood infected with HIV, 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means that we should issue 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since the Hema-Quebec delivers 400 to 500 thousand blood products each year, more than 24 years should be allowed to occur in such a case and to be infected with HIV virus through a blood product.
I think that anyone can now accept or prescribe a blood transfusion to restore health, says the number one leader of the Hema-Québec.
"The challenge of the coming year will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We don't even know what new pathogens will get into the system.
It was only last year that the chikugunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, enters the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must constantly be alert," Dr. Décary continued and stressed that, apart from the emergency supplies, the Häma Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"With the ageing population, the needs also fall.
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population has an impact on the population of carnivores, as the number of persons capable of slaughter on the network accounts for only 3% of the Quebec population.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years old, who fulfils the competence criteria, gives blood every 56 days, every six days each year.
On average, 14% of the applicants do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria is the case have not been eligible for a year for the victim’s sacrifice.
"We have enough reserves to satisfy the needs of the hospitals to achieve this 3 percent.
It's very rare to run out of supplies.
On the other hand, we need to increase the number of donors to the extent that the existing old people are getting older because they can't give blood after a while.
However, people are very hard to convince to give blood, but it is even harder to keep them and make them become regular donors.
In this rushing world today, man has barely had a single hour to go out and give blood," regrets Francine Décary.
The €297 million annual budget provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeball tissue and skin tissue, which are used in almost only severely burned individuals.
These tissues are analyzed, converted and frozen and then placed at the Hema Quebec, which also handles the only public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The blood from the umbilical cord that is treated as just a medical waste can be produced from blood that is rich in stem cells, allowing treatment of severe diseases (such as leukemia).
"Sometimes we swore that we'd get into our gang the thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to take over a thousand new samples each year.
In the early years of next year, we are likely to start offering these for organ transplantation" - Dr. Décary stated, who says that the coronary artery withdrawal programme is very popular these days.
"Many mothers are sad that this is not possible" - it is true that this is true, because the Hema-Quebec is not able to make this complex and costly program available at all schools in Quebec.
Football kick - in the semi-final of the Imp Act
Yesterday, the FF Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders at 3:1 on USL-1 and entered the semifinal with a total of 4:3 results. It was the third-final second and decisive match that took place at the Saputo Stadium.
The main goal was to win the fight in the 90th minute of the match by Antonio Ribeiro.
While there was no first half goal, the second was found in the enemy’s net by the two middle courses of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino.
Roger Levesque, alone in the Aounders team, managed to play the gate to Matt Jordan.
Let us recall that in the first match on Friday, the Impact 2:1 was defeated by Starfire Complex in Tukwilla, in the suburb of Seattle.
Impact plays the Vancouver White Caps in the semifinal.
On Saturday evening in Minnesota, the team of Thunder, who got 3:1 out of Whitecaps on the first match, won 4:1, but in the semifinal, Whitecaps got in with a total of 5:4 results.
Impact is expected to meet with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are still specified today.
In the Dióhéj - the winner of Kovalev ogát
The Canadiens' favorite bride is ready for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks, and finally the Canadiens won 3:2 a.m. on penalties last night in Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, won a goal. Plekanec two and Kovalev ended the match with a goal bus, which was the fourth win from the team’s six finals.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who won the only goal of the division.
"I'm not ready yet", warns the Russian player.
"I need another game to really feel good."
"He tried too much to get himself out in the first third," noted Guy Carbonne Ee.
"But I think the outcome of the game was a pleasure.
He's had a lot of sex."
Charest's northern aspirations.
The Prime Minister will not rule out that the election will begin this year.
The meeting of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest, was barely concluded yesterday at Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), will win the interim election to be held today.
"Back to our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was defined by Jean Charest at the meeting of the Québec Liberal Party in Lévis yesterday. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, but the president was also trying to focus on the point.
During the performance, the drawings of the patterns like "Moulin à máss" were designed behind his back.
The three huge projectors were followed by impressive recordings: water plants dams, mining, Quebec on "Google Maps", maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during the selection periods.
The Prime Minister at the press conference refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
"The plan" is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's vision of the future of Quebec, which is formed in a "new economic area". This includes a work agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements planned for Ontario.
In recent times, openings to the North (i.e. north of 49th parallel) have often been included in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject before.
The Prime Minister, however, insisted only on explaining why he considered North "to be a treasure mine with enormous potential", but he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts or particular priorities for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been highlighted: water plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which are further stimulated by the growth of the countries in contact with them and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
On the north, there is "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds" - listed by Chares.
This area, which is "twice the size of France", is our territory, the territory of Quebec.
Not also, but within us," the Prime Minister reiterated, stressing that it intends to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the Gold Abitib, the Québec design work, the Gulf...
"This is our future!" he added, after holding a stage break, he looked at the huge map behind his back.
The North, which is 70% of the Quebec area, also includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always required of itself, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if it comes down to it, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the government," he stated.
On the other hand, "In the light of climate change, we need to reconsider our view of the North", said the Prime Minister, speaking about the northern transit through which it opens every year due to the melting of the Arctic ice.
According to the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, it is an important task to take over the territory in this new geopolitical environment.
What about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec would pay particular attention to them and that the plan would bring many benefits, especially for young people.
Two ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourne (previously a letter from the Hungarian Republic of Parti Québécois) have already started the negotiation with thirty local communities.
It has also started its work on the Committee of Ministers, chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Minister for Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, "not a absolute summit", where "creating a common vision" is created.
Rural development would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly" - the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the dreams of the pre-eminent liberal president.
"Just as the previous liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend that began on Friday with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of the election of the Jean Lesage President.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois plant should be identified as a Adélard-Godca barrier.
"Our politicians, among them God, who founded the Hydro-Québect, Lesage, who carried out the quiet revolution and the nationwide expansion of water power plants, or Boussa, known as his father in the Bay of James, all knew how to work the future," said Jean Charlest.
At the press conference, he also quoted another - true and conservative - work, namely John Diefenbaker, "Roads to the North", the Prime Minister of 1957-1963.
Regarding the design of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower plant, President Grest stressed that the deployment is planned for 2012.
"This is between us, but I'm going to be there," he told his believers, and his statement was received by a loud applause storm.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of a vote this autumn, which the law allows for.
He stressed, however, that the calendar was already full because he had been tasked at the Federal Council meeting in China and the Quebec-New York Summit.
The meeting at the end of the week has proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to present nationalist decisions that have been approved without any thought. This is mainly about 'agreements concerning the Constitution': the Liberal Party demands, in particular, recognition of 'The specific nature of Québéc' in the Constitution.
I would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Communications Council, and these members would have the right to protect against decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, sceptically adopted the main points of the Northern Plan.
Paulina Marois, head of the parti Québécois, re-introduced the North Quebec Development Policy, which was introduced by the Land Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government in power in 2003 rejected the application of this policy.
If they had not done so, Mrs Marois said in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was the candidate for the Jean-Tallinn vote to be held today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that this is not a mere play," notes Vice-President Sébastien Proulx, who replaced today's return from his freedom with Mario Dumont.

Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Chamber (in addition to Minister of Justice) last summer, took the initiative to call Louise Arbourt Canada "fear".
Tribing a woman who fought for the truth without a doubt and who deserves all our thanks - that tells a lot about the people around the eunuch and about Stephen Harper himself.
So this is our government, which, in one of the Western countries concerned alone, has not delivered its own national from the Guantanamo concentration camp.
This government, which absolutely does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager when he committed crimes against him.
It is the only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, has refused to speak and let a child soldier inhumane circumstances be despised by a child soldier.
The only government that's making a puppet show for the D.A. is the government that's investigating a defendant's conviction.
Just remember that UNICEF, the Amnesty International and the Canadian lawyers are also demanding the return of Omar Khadr to Canada in order to obtain a fair procedure.
And our government is looking at the tour: it does not matter to him that a young adult is now completely destroyed, and many years of torture is likely to have sealed his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not aware of this now, we are currently experiencing the sublime destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy": Harper always sounds this word, which from her mouth means nothing but an empty word.
The time has come, when there is no longer any truth: it can be selfishly beaten, tortured and imprisoned by any Canadian citizen, as the leader of a government that has so far been in a minority (and what can be after 14 October...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found in a party that excels the virtues of virtue, the Law and the Truth. They do not see that this government is cutting its foot to the values for which the good news and honor of our country is due to the good news and dignity of our country.
Dear Mr. Toews, I'd like this to be the only place you're looking for. Not anywhere else.
Would you like to comment on this? - The Barrick Gold orwell express notation.
A letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President-General of Barrick Gold Mine, Canada, was published in Le Devoir on 17 September.
Following Orwell's explanation, Garver claims that the world's largest production company has launched six million-dollar claims for the purpose of initiating a so-called "public debate" initiative against three authors and a small-paid publishing company.
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decisions are made not by the truth, but by the law, especially in the case of the act of defamation.
It is not surprising that Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
Would Barrick Gold really be the best way for the public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to him?
Notwithstanding the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada must spend significant amounts of protection and fight in a battle where, on the other hand, the army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible sources of the mining industry are on the other side.
In the face of such an unconvincing conflict, however, they often use the tactics of destroying the defendant and concluding a friendly agreement that not only silences the adversaries, but also threatens those who would try to address the issue again.
If the Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have explained his views to the public.
Although in many other countries, where Barrick Gold is active, this happens differently, in Canada the argumenters do not usually hit each other with a stick, but they say their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had enough time to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, the media, the public, paying for independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust the public, and with a move, it is possible to put forward applications and letters for the protection of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could point out how he can initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, he ignores the opinion of this public opinion?
In the Vice-President's head, this word is probably just a busiced lawyer, and not a whole Canadian population: the meaning of the concept is thus very narrowed down.
In a democratic state, freedom of expression applies even to those who judge others.
Barrick Gold, however, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are mainly supported by the public because it condemns the mine's rough process.
The public will be willing to hear the Barrick and judgment, but on the basis of civil arguments, rather than on the basis of a motion for silence for a number of people. (In the context of the term "publish debate", Barrick Gold recently called on the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to the surreal reasoning of the Garver, the Barrick Gold process is an open-ended attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all civil society.
The procedure denies the right to make and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of the intellectual activity.
In a country like Canada, if you can only study and discuss issues that are not pleasing to the rich companies of today's world, who will take the lead?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, this could be done in accordance with the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer that question.
In our university circle we have long been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts.
Barrick Gold's in-depth procedure is a good idea to have an open debate, contrary to what he claims.
This is a loss to both the university world and the Canadian public debate institution. It is time that governments put in place measures that restrict legal proceedings for such abuse.
Street rescue action - Democrats and Republics have agreed.
The government of Bush and the leaders of the Republic and of the Republic of the Republic of Estonia concluded yesterday an agreement on an economic rescue measure, which, since the major global economic crisis in the 1930s, has been the major scale of such a plan.
The $700 billion plan, designed to contain a devastating financial crisis on Wall Street for months, has yet to be approved by the two Houses of the Congress.
Key elements of the plan: better monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses taken over due to non-payments; right of access to the payment of the managers of the assisted companies.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Minister of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. Congress and Judd Gregg, representative of the Republican during the trial yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, announced the good news after the two-day marathon hearing was concluded.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the market," said Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush Government.
"We have done all we can to save the real economy and the American citizens from the present crisis in Wall Street", explained the Democratic Member.
"The most important aspect is that if we do not do this, the shock, chaos and confusion will be huge in the everyday lives of the Americans," said the representative of the Republic of Judd Gregg.
The trial was speeded up in the last few hours, worrying that another accident would have an adverse effect on the views of investors.
The agreement was reached until the time limit for opening the stock exchange this morning.
The two presidents who joined the negotiations later expressed their willingness to enter into the agreement, but were expressed as a matter of fact, they are not happy that the situation has increased until the end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed himself to the extension of the agreement with elements such as the maintenance of the house or the payment of payments to the heads of the state-aided companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps on account of other people's negligence, that's not too pleasant.
However, these steps are necessary" - notes in an American television show.
And when John McCain asked another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, he said, "I'd like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I read on the big lines is already evident that this is something that we all have to digest and which we can move on with.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion plan, taxpayers' money would buy the dual assets of U.S. financial institutions, the inalienable assets of some kind that they risk.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis that led to the outbreak of real estate, leading to the collapse of risky real estate loans (second mortgage loans) and to the transformation of other debt securities (trade) and finally to the freezing of liquid assets and the insurrection of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was published by a group of Republican Members last week.
Looks like we've been able to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that some of the "toxic" tools of companies in difficulty would rather be guaranteed by the government than purchased it.
In order to ensure that all members of the Congress are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which provides that if the government has to bear losses for five years under the programme, it may levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a 250 billion dollar instalment would be paid for the first time; this could be followed by another 100 billion, if the President considers it necessary.
The final payment of the remaining $350 billion should be approved by the Congress by a new vote.
In exchange for the assistance, Washington will acquire shares in the supported companies, through which it will receive dividends from profit and which it may sell after the crisis has erupted.
The federal government will be able to delay the take-up of real estate covering the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and it may also set the maximum amount of remuneration and payment to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The drawing-up of the plan would like the House to vote today and the Senate to vote on Wednesday.
However, despite their tensions, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Since the statements against the plan against both the Republics and the Democrats have been repeated again.
"It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice," declared Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the financial committee of the House, to his constituents.
"We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that taxpayers should pay."
Brad Sherman, a Democrat representative leading a small congressional group called "sceptical faction", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"The four hundred excellent economic professionals, including three Nobel-ed students, wrote to us to ask the Congress: do not hurry and examine carefully which way he chooses," said Sherman yesterday.
At the same time today, they have again understood that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux States have announced that a part of the Fortis Group will be distributed in value of EUR 11,2 billion (16,3 billion US dollar).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg has become necessary since the announcement by the French Government of BNP Paribas, he does not seek out his bankrupt competitor after the loss of EUR 2 million (USD 2.9 billion) following the crisis in the United States of America's secondary mortgage loans.
Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest companies with 85 000 employees.
"This is not money thrown out" - said Mr. Wouter Bos, Dutch Minister for Finance yesterday.
"In exchange for voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is expected to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, across the La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing a new bank to be reorganised, which has been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the ongoing loans of the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which the real estate loans amounted to 41 billion pounds (USD 7,5 billion).
The Spanish bank yesterday announced that they would acquire the subsidiaries and employees of the UK company.
This would be the second bank that, since the beginning of the crisis, the British government has wanted to state up.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Good-bye to the computer server.
The sun’s eyes are, according to some, the most important hit card, and it was, according to others, his weakness.
Has the dragon smiled American actor ever got rid of a Nazi mirror?
Yeah, I'm not.
By its shyness, sensitivity and associated talent, it was also a long-standing style that was far removed from him, which is the essence of the great monuments of the art world.
But it did run a huge course.
Paul Newman died at the age of 83, lung cancer on the property of Connectiveti, one of the last icons of his American movie flower.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who he looked like, and who, for a long time, was considered to be a rival on the film screen. In his role he was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixing of blood often results from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1955 in Ohio as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin in Ohio.
European roots contributed to the birth of one of the symbolic figures of the false dream.
He didn't think too much of himself that only made sense.
In the early 1950s, he studied at the Yale University drama phase and at the Actor's Studio in New York, before the theatre, the television and soon thereafter into the cinema world.
In addition to the fact that civil rights were at the forefront of my civil rights, in 1979 he was a car driver in my 24-hour race in Le Mans. However, he was considered to be a sex symbol, although he has been happily married to Princess Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now you can never know what the shadows of this mysterious, closed-minded, professional life of an actor who hated the sounding of show-business, which will remain a mystery forever.
He was honest, in the least sense of all, with the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the movie fans: in his great role, he can only be seen on the black screen of memories.
Looking at his career, the seventh American art, which has been in front of us for over 50 years, has been marked with continuous changes in cinema.
In our memory, the "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" is mixed up with the charming cowboy (1969) and the agitating young man (Elizabeth Taylor), the role of which was seen in Tennessee Williams in the Tennessee Williams treatment in 1958.
In recent times (1990), we can remember in the image of the sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is faced with an old age by the fact that his marriage has not replaced his hopes.
In addition, Paul Newman has many other faces in his films.
In his film "Somebody upstairs", he was given an amazing act in the role of the fierce criminal boxer Rocky Graziano, who was originally a part of James Dean, who was taken over after his death by Newman's artist career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Big Trouble", which won the best film in 1973.
Roberten, in his genius film "The Svindler" (1961), has created a bitter, sustainable billionaire and has returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's film "The Color of Money". In 1987 he received a single award for nine awards for his last performance.
A changing time, but it's always the same expression: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The period of his death was preserved by a change in the ages.
Young people are particularly familiar with George Roy Hill's "The Icebreakers" cult film (1977), where Reggie Dunlopo, a kinky team, is not an expert working with the usual methods.
His disciples from the Coen brothers saw him in 'The Big Jump' in 1994.
The series was closed in 2003 by Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Damage": this was the last one to appear in the role of an Irish mafia chief.
Unlike many movie legends who have relatively soon abandoned the film screen, Newman has been in the reflective lights for a long time, even though he has condemned him with his lance, light and hypocrisy.
Bertrand Tavernier, French filmmaker, did not consider it to be "the live caffea of underplay" without all the humor: he thought his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always loyal to the handsome Paul Newman, who, for a long time, just fell into the lap of the movies.
Yet, young and successful characters were less common: rather, they were living on the surface of society — nervous, alcoholic, malignant or hopeful — and they were able to restore their drift and rebellion with perfect credibility.
As a ranking, Newman showed a less well-known face: his deep-sighted and sensitive human being.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (adaptation of the novel of Canadian writer Laurence), Joanne Woodward, in the main character, drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman.
The film "Harry and Son", made in 19th April, with a film of restraint and sadness, commemorates his son, Scott, who died of drug overdose in a drug overdose.
His close friend and old fellow warrior Robert Redford (with whom they were together in "The Big Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid", he said, "His presence has made my life better and the world better.
Honor and the joy of life: it was the secret of this great actor's vibrating personality, which we have just lost.
In addition to his career as a legend, his remarks on civil rights, the environment, the fight for independent film production and the outbursts of Hollywood are clouded by his remarks on civil rights, the fight against the environment, independent film production.
We have often seen his picture smile on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods. He made it taste pretty bad, although he thought it was funny at the beginning.
However, income from such sales has always been transferred to a foundation for children suffering from illness.
Newman never sat on his pets: he was always committed to the profession.
He left it to his five daughters in a letter with the following sentences: "Your father always, and all the time, was inconceivably grateful for the star of glory.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also a privilege for us to pursue the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a citizen, above all.
What are they producing at the Zutchlag & Tsai invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, a trial against János Zuschlag and his staff will begin.
The politician and his partners are accused of fraud and other crimes, including document counterfeiting, committed in a criminal and commercial way, which are causing serious harm to their politicians and their partners.
According to the D.A., the successful tender funds were used for their own purposes, and the performance of their duties was often proven by incorrect invoices.
Public and municipal funds - totalling some HUF 65 million - were moved to the cash register of the Young Left and partly to some individuals.
The method described by the Authority was that the tender money received was collected on the basis of cost invoices which did not result in real execution and the associations never fulfilled the undertaking.
Indictment was a large part of the charges wrong.
These were purchased on the market in the city centre, and the circulars were manufactured in Kiskunhala.
And which companies will be in the name of invoice production, including those on the Balaton-upland road to which István Lados has been sent by János Zuschag.
According to the most recent, he had to look like children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children's children
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which, as a model, followed by the invoices to be submitted to the tenders of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Social and Labour Store and the Municipality of Budapest for the first time.
Most of these were recorded by István Lados with his partner, András Yri, who, according to our information, has most of the reports necessary for the award of the aid.
One of the members of Lados's "study trip" was a building.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags in 2003, the resort provided a meal for the forty-person group of the Commissioner's Point Association.
That is why, according to the CEO, they would not have been able to access the restaurant at the same time.
Likewise, for the better future - later together, the Third Millennium Foundation has been agitated from the form and content flaws of the bill issued in the summer of 2002 to the Foundation.
In fact, there were only three rooms of a cinnamon house in which more than ten people could not sleep one night, and yet the bill was about one hundred and thirty guests.
However, fan-rich form fillers were overrun even when they were registered with the same service-handling Pigal Kft., which, according to the information provided to the prosecution, did not include documents for the better future and the name of Hoppá.
The company manager, Győr Farkas, told the ényg.hu that when he was called in and billed to the D.A., he immediately knew it was a false document.
"Our company's name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: for formal reasons, the fact that a hundred people have been put away according to the invoices, because they have a total of 11 rooms with no room available.
Furthermore, the invoice was also for a meal, while their locality was not working a long time ago.
The zealous premiers did not follow up on the fact that the travel agency in Budapest that they looked like is organising only foreign travels, and thus in botorul Hungarian, they marked a delivery service in the payment account as a service, which also did not match the company's accounting practice.
As the investigation has shown, the VAT was also included in the document, although the transport activity to countries outside the European Union was not VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong in the four documents issued by Hotel Révfüp Kft. for the Right Future, since the company's service is not subject to the VAT rate of 25 per cent, but 15 per cent, and the hotel's employees have only issued machine invoices, but the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the "exhibitors" account was damaged by the fact that, for a company, road freight was identified as an activity carried out - it was discovered through the Public Prosecutor's Office's procedure - which was not carried out by the company which was originally based on the investment advice.
Also, it was found that the accounts for the Third Millennium Foundation, the 20th century Cultural Association of the 20th century and the Commissioner’s Point were false because of the non-adequate accounting format and not true stamps.
Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or in the case of a sports camp in Kuneva, whose representatives have denied that the invoices would have been issued by them.
Furthermore, the instigators did not notice that the HIB Kft. was closed at the time (2001) when the Youth Union group was eating there, which is why the company's liquidator, as we know, denied that he had issued the paper.
They made a conscious statement.
Another group of issuers is those who were aware of the need to issue a fiscal account.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Budapest Foundation will issue an invoice for the Third Millennium Foundation for some four million Forints.
The leader of Collab Kft., according to the prosecution, was led by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the physical invoice.
He also cooperated with the Zuschlags with the Biogate Kft. currently being wound up, which in 2003 provided the Better Future Foundation, the Atlas Association and the Red Fenugreek Association with invoices issued to a value of HUF 5 million, which had not been the basis for a real economic activity.
No money, because the completed accounts were followed by a practitioner, but this has been forgotten by the organisations in their documents.
The next group of accounting companies is the group of those who are connected to the defendants.
Thus, the delivery officer of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft., who is based in Budapest for fuel and road trade, was Iván Cubav.
The company also issued several invoices for the sale of securities in October, November and December 2005 at a value of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd., a small hospital in charge of liquidation since 14 September 2005.
This company was the CEO of a Romanian man to whom Iván Cuba would have also transferred documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Cuba, in the course of the investigation, admitted that he issued an invoice on behalf of Kft to Atlas, Hoppa and the Joint Third Year Foundation and received their compensation.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian workers were founded by Fa-Bani Jos Fajár Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, however, none of them worked, which according to the defendant was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, the company has benefited from it because, at the request of Saint-Zsolt Szente, who also produces the documents of the formations, the companies are issuing invoices on behalf of the companies for the Zushlag associations: Atlas and the Y-Generation.
Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices for Cubaov to the entities at HUF 14,2 million.
The D.A. considered that 10 percent of the amounts in the invoices and the VAT hit the Cubaov mark.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fiscal accounts, these were produced for the Commissioner's Point tender.
In January 2006, Y-Generation and the Association submitted an invitation to tender for Modern Hungary to the public benefit organization of the Socialist Party, the Mihály Foundation of TMA.
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not allocated for the purposes set out in the invitation to tender.
To keep this from happening, five individual accounts received from the Works Team Kft. were submitted to the TMA.
These invoices were found otherwise in the search of Árp Árp Kemecsei in his office in the educational wallet.
Some of the defendants in the trial, as they did at the D.A.'s office, are likely to report on the process of accounting records.
Most importantly, if you are the prime defendant, János Zuschlag chooses to raise the veil on everything.
His previous statement is not too detailed, and although he has promised to speak all over again, he has not yet done so.
Ask whether this is the right thing to do, perhaps most of the damage, 50 million forints were negotiated by the Socialists in the process of reimbursement, and Zusi will take the fall.
Anyone who may have been offended today, as his requests for arrest or detention were constantly found to be deaf ears in order to comply with the conditions of his arrest or to be in custody.
While the perpetrators of more serious and non-conforming economic crimes can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the outcome of the proceedings against them, they are not allowed to do so.
The psychology of overprice: why are we giving out more money?
At the fairs, customers tend to issue more money, overestimate the goods.
Neurological and economic foundations of this familiar and seemingly irrational behaviour have been revealed to neurologist and economist researchers at the University of New York.
According to their study in Science, people do not want to stay in competition like eBay, for example, and therefore pay too high a price.
The research tried to map this "play" nervous system scheme using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was lottery, and the other group was a player in the auction, while the functional magnetic scan (fMRI) method was used to examine the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but in the course of the game - which is an important element of the over-leasing of the other party - the complex under the striatum, under the cortex, was ineffectively operational upon the loss of the game.
This area of the brain plays a role in a number of other functions of the nervous system as part of the "supervisor" of the nervous system.
Researchers therefore believe that the price can be set by avoiding a acute reaction to striatum.
In support of their theory, the members of the research group of economics have also carried out a financial-related examination.
These three groups have bided against a partner under different circumstances.
The group simply explained the real value of the product in question, and they made their bets.
In addition, another group was promised that if they won the game, they would be rewarded with another $15 in cash.
On the other hand, the third group just received $15 before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in case of a loss auction.
So the difference between the two groups was simply that one of them was the winner, and the other one was stressed for the loss.
However, the members of the team that played against the "loss" were willing to make a higher deposit than the control group and the strength group, proving the hypothesis of the neurologists.
"These results are not derived from the theory of any modern economy.
For so far, only the joy of the victory and the risk reduction have shown the phenomena of the auction.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by now reaching a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we contact a doctor?
Around half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infections, and Hungary are referred to as chronic liver disease as the leading cause of death.
A hundred thousand can be done to treat the number of domestic hepatitis, but only seven thousand is treated: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name of the hepatitis is the aggregate name of infectious livers caused by different viruses.
In their symptoms, they have a wide variety of side effects, characterised by inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and underlying diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses consist of two main components depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the feed channel (such as infected food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (convulsive, vaginal, saliva).
Passengers certainly have a serious degree of protection against A and B viruses, no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two or three weeks after eating the infected food, generally feeling unwell, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
Afterwards, yellowing on the skin and the eyes, the stools become clear, the urine dark, the healing can last for two or three weeks.
One million people worldwide die of the most serious disease, liver cancer and liver failure caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people will be treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can also lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the pathogen subsides liver cells, and in many cases only 20-30 years from now, the first symptoms will occur.
After that, it is very important to take preventive measures and to carry out regular tests.
In the three groups, there is an average increase in the incidence of such a disease: between people who had passed blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
At present, 200 million people worldwide are infected with chronic hepatitis C virus.
Since the disease may already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is important to contact your doctor if you experience any unknown symptoms of origin.
In time, recognizing the disease can cure, the virus can be removed from the body, thus eliminating infectivity and preventing cancer from developing.
September 30 is the world day of hepatitis, which was first organised in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to inflammation of the liver caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, does it hurt less?
Recent research has shown that religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller, which may already have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment to examine how faith affects people's perception of pain, reports British Telegraph.
In the course of the rather strange investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same kind of atheists were electrocked, while they were all studying a painting representing a Virgin Mary.
The results show that Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technology that detects the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to eliminate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians, along with academics, participate from different parts of the university.
The study was precisely carried out by strengthening a rocking device to the left hand of the test subject, which provided the electro-occupational shock.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look at two paintings, the image of the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The authors of the study were hoping that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a kind of religious state between believers, while the da Vinci image was chosen because it was not thought to be too much of the other and it was a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour on a MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroscopes in four consecutive parts, while either they looked at the religious theme or the general view.
The Catholics have reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" as if they were "carried out" and "residually, they were at peace".
While looking at the image of the religious theme, 12 percent less pain was reported than was seen in the sight of Leonardo's creation.
Miguel Farias, a psychologist who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect with any powerful image can be achieved, but only the right picture should be found for the atheists.
"We should find a way to find someone to whom they feel very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Bishop Tom Wright of England welcomed the results of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should, and in many cases will change our personality." - added Wright.
After the excellent results, the question is, how would it affect their pain control if Leonardo or a similar calibre painter showed the image of one of the Madonnas to the believers?
Would the sight of the quality Virgin Mary be more likely to produce even better results?
You are what you share about yourself.
On the tenth birthday of Google, you can tell us that people are at least as close to their heads in the sky as they are; you know where they are on vacation, what special orders they are attending and what they care about.
And that's still not enough for Eric Schmidt, one of the main guys in the company, according to the company.
However, as far as scepticals who are very close to orwell are concerned, the very essence of web 2.0 is not seen.
Most recently, Schmidt has told the Financial Times that the main purpose of Google's main goal is to collect more personal data on their users, and this is necessary to be able to hold on to the original objective of Google Founders, which said: "Let's get all the information from the world into the system!".
According to the commented Google Director, after ten years of world-shaping work, the company will only be at the beginning of the process of managing all the information.
What will happen five years later, Schmidt said that he wanted Google to be able to answer questions such as "what do I do tomorrow?" or "how do I really work?" - but until then software can't answer such simple questions because they don't know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact extent to which they are looking for IP addresses and the sites to which they are exposed after searching for online search.
By means of the Staffalied Search launched two years ago, users may, for example, store their own surfing backgrounds, look back at what they were looking for, click on what they were looking for, and thus will generate much more personalized results in the long term - the same logic will be based on Recommandations, which products and services provide us with the system based on our past and our preferences.
What if you use my data against me if you look at what I do? - ask users who are concerned about seeing Google's data monopoly?
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company may be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, a desire for freedom, or even an attack against power, triggering counter-reactions in the Internet.
It is confirmed, however, that all the terms requested are not recorded, but may, where appropriate, be transferred to a third party, in such legal cases, there is nothing to protect the identity of Internet users.
The strongest example of the past may have been a coordinated action against the Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Government of Brazil with information on the social media site Orkut that it maintains, allowing identification of pedophiles, on the social side of the Orkut.
On the other hand, internet players concerned about personal rights may have sneezed even in May when the company, with its e-Justice organisation, successfully proved its truth in court against him: therefore, Google will not be able to trust any of the points of the Constitution in any way that it has secretly asked for information.
(In any case, the federal government has successfully developed some 500,000 web addresses and thousands of search expressions, which it has received by reference to the adoption of a previously adopted Child Protection Act for years, but has not managed to obtain the lists of individual users and the full list of websites and passwords covering two months.)
Thus, Google's judgement is quite controversial: those who are considered to have given their personal data are being fooled by their feeling that their intimate sphere and privacy are being undermined by starting to use Google's services and by the insurrection of the conservative merji-minding factions against them.
Meanwhile, U.S. geek culture and its enthusiastic computer associations, activists and users in many countries, sees the next generation of large companies, the "genius" in them, contrary to their rival, the relationship recorded as a world conqueror for Windows, no matter how much both of them fight for the same purpose.
This may be because Google does not request an identification code from its users, does not request money for its applications, the open, free, up-to-date source code and package of programs that are much more accessible, younger and cooler than the official software practice.
However, it may also happen that the genes can clearly see the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which was just the result of one of the most recently voiced passwords on the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration than to deliberately leave clues behind us and use the communication channels at our disposal, and while these vary from one person to another, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average youth on multiple social media sites may also profile from Facebook to Xang, connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing his musical features, and all of them may be connected to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, which automatically display their latest photographs stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While you can read about a number of exemplary cases that show up: the court can easily see the morning price of a common friendly circle, seeing who you've been spending the evening with or can fire an employee of a company just because you write your sincere opinion about top management in your blog: a sure, completely re-evaluated concept of privacy for the time being.
Anyone who lives online is made up of what you show yourself, which is the basis behind the behaviour of today’s young people.
And anyone who wants to hide or at least wants to avoid Google Monopoly can do so (e.g. with Scroogle, who uses Google’s system but who does not intentionally leave it).
For example, the number of people who do not want to register on social sites without being able to locate them may not, for example, lead to alternative versions of Google's online applications from the editor to the photographer and to the interrogator, which do not connect to giant server parks and which do not match the best profile available to us.
The public is not looking too secretly for Google to display the tooth protein.
The company's current value of $156 billion is worth more than the IBM ( $140 billion), Intel ( $124 billion) or Coca-Cola ( $110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threatens the revenues of advertising agencies, and the services introduced at an increasingly fast pace cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
The critical criteria, however, also find counters to these concerns: for example, the senior management has completely rejected the opposition of employees after double the company's fee, and the company has found it too costly that employees enjoy a quite many meals every day, but all of them are smudged by the fact that Google has put a head in the government of the PRC in 2006 and, under their agreement, the company is hurling out any findings that harm the good taste and the Chinese regime's image.
One of the company's internal rules suggests that no new service will be announced in advance, only when it is already in use, but it can move the world at another point in certain months and years: while some people believe that Google's project for book and magazine planning and arching has reached sizes that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others fear of the system of AI, and that we can build a complete health profile on ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and employees.
The fact that Google is creating a genetic database can also provide good material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, Scroogled point orwelli, describes the future in which a person can only be approached alarmingly from Google's data.
Two-year-olds helped the two-year-old killer with the use of the printing press.
Two young people were questioned by the police in the case of a two-legged murder, and they were suspected to be involved in the investigation of the crime, said the spokesperson of the Police headquarters in Borsod County on Tuesday.
Young people have been admitted to the act of burden and are currently accused of criminality.
Two minors, according to MTI information, are defending two girls on the job.
Crime is also punishable by a guarantee of up to 5 years.
The victim of the osedi double murder - a 23-year-old local man - was placed under prior arrest on Sunday.
Pre-designed, profit-making, it is identified as a crime of multiple manslaughter.
The investigation has shown that 23-year-old young man owed a larger sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debts, so last Wednesday, he lured his creditor to a rustic establishment where he killed him and then to his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man is preparing to commit a crime, as well as indicating that he committed murder with a weapon hidden at the scene.
The police will examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert in the investigation.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
Six hundred million euros - about five billion Czech krona - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to purchase a 100-percent share in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer, which was made by the Polish people, despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from any new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is publicly owned by the State.
99% of shares are held by the State of the Republic of Poland, which wishes to sell more than 60 percent of the paper in a few months' time.
The Czech economic day of E15 is new to know that the offer of Poland is the highest amount so far offered by interested parties for the Prague stock exchange.
According to the Czech authorities, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse tendered.
Petr Kobl, the manager of the Prague Stock Exchange last week, stated that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out that this would lead to the loss of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the price price exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion years by market experts.
Under the agreement of the shareholders, approximately 90 percent of the paper could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with a share of about 25 %, followed by the Ceska Sporitelna Bank 14,7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 13.5 percent.
From a European perspective on the financial crisis, the European Courts' point of view is that of the financial crisis.
In their comments on Tuesday, which are being devoted to the ever-decrease economic crisis, the European papers that lead to the ever-decrease economic crisis are already referred to as "the 11th of September".
We owe the President of the United States for the global financial disaster - accused of the Roman La Repubblica - the president has not even been able to set up his own party behind a legislative proposal that has been put together in this wound, aimed at remedying the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billion investors of Warren Buffett, it is best to talk about the second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has led the world economy to the end of the collapse.
There is an increasing risk of collapse of the American financial system, and then the whole world will suffer.
After all, Bush's plan was not perfect, but as a result of the vote in Congress, there is a risk that Washington will not provide a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The appeal can no longer be ruled out - it is shown by the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
States today can still provide life-jackets to financial corporations and rescue them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse like domino risk, they will not be satisfied with either the money or any more eyelashes.
In the long term, it will be necessary for the Member States of the European Union to exceed their national autonomy and to centralise controls over isolated financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than EUR 100 billion were received by vulnerable financial institutions - reminds me of the Vienna Der Standard, which says that the concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, have to go deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis are becoming more and more realistic.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is like swept through the old continent.
The "saviours" don't have to spend almost billions of euros on it, but I would like to be recorded: in which case it is reasonable to extend taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The dogg flight is surrounded by an intelligent car.
What would be the best way to develop the technologies to avoid impact if it was not to mimic a barrier in the world that existed in nature?
For example, bees belong to bees.
In the surprising project presented at the CEATEC in Japan, dogs gave the strategic starting idea to Nissan engineers for how to capture the next generation of conflict prevention systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyo University, Nissan built the BR23C-type bio-repaired car robot control system, a digitized mini-car, dedicated to the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate aim of facilitating the development of a system that eliminates all conflicts.
During a flight, every male will develop your oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our protective cover - explained at the exhibition by Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research Development.
Its role is important to the complex eye of the bee, which in all directions can see in more than 300 degrees of perspective.
In order to copy the complex function of the eye, the engineers touched on the idea of laser diameter.
This will identify the obstacles within a 2 m distance of 180 degrees in the field of vision before BR23C, calculate their distance and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which will immediately turn into an action to avoid a collision.
During the breakage of the second, the detection of the obstacle and the car robot, mimicing the movement of the uterine, immediately changes direction of the wheels by avoiding the impact that is necessary to prevent the impact.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidive maneuver is entirely inspired by its way of doing so.
"If that were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of the Mobility Laboratory and Auto Rob project.
It should react in a consistent and immediate manner, since this technology is the most vulnerable and internal layer of protective shields, a layer in which the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should be conducted in an eye-to-eye manner.
However, unlike bees, the difference should not arise upwards, downwards or transversely, only two dimensions and only in the direction of the transverseness of wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility available for bees to avoid other bees, only the motion and acceleration and deceleration of the bees were used as an option for the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries, which are easier and higher in energy density, which means that they have a longer life span than lithium ion variant.
And according to Andoh, the inspired intelligent response is an important, not a ability to process or store data even less.
Each and every two times, this structure needs to process and react to only a few entrance signals.
It is not necessary to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on the data from previous maneuvers, so that it keeps using only a few dozen miles of memory.
There is no need to have a gigabyte or even a wad of memory.
This is the first step in developing the immediate escape technology that Nissan estimates could be involved in new vehicles within 10 years.
Further deployment of the unit with the GPS-satellite navigation system may be an opportunity to drive the car to the end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
He also had a name for the child with the poison medicine.
The written version of the 700 billion-dollar economic rescue package law to purchase bad loans from banks has been completed in several instalments.
In the first round, they spend half the money on the first round.
According to the Eastern party time, during the further discussions after the Saturday midnight, the congress leaders were at a loss in the debate about a total package of $700 billion for life, which has been going on for days - reported Reuters.
We have made significant progress - said Mr Pelosi, Democrat President of the US Congress, saying that only the agreement is left on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidents Barack Obama and John McCain.
Mr. Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, said that the programme will work and be effective, but we need more work to do. According to fear, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy's wagon.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the 8th (i.e. the Central European Time Monday two hours a.m.) on the Washing Time of Asian markets, but did not cause a spectacular start in the market.
The draft legislation on the programme, which will be the subject of the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilization Act, will be the first to vote on the law by the Council on Monday, and will be taken in the Senate on Monday.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi last night, and also at the White House, they welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made this evening and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy - declared by Tony Fratto, the White House spokesperson.
The programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have been to spend $700 billion on the purchase of high-quality, credit-backed securities at the same time.
In the first round, a maximum of half of the amount of 700 billion can be spent immediately after the Congress is expected to vote on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance will buy credit-based, misqualified securities, and the fate of another $100 billion will depend on the president's decision.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will participate.
The delay of another half of the 700 billion depends on the new decision of the Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactics: at the same time, it can buy bad loans, mortgages and securities with a mortgage back, or other types of "toxic" loans.
In the context of and directly through the purchase of goods, the competent authorities of the Ministry were sold.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial treasure guarantees the assets that cause concern, for which companies will pay the company a price corresponding to the expected losses.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the means necessary to achieve the urgent needs of the U.S. financial system of up to $700 billion, whether it is about buying the wrong assets in a wide range of ways, whether it is about insurance or avoiding the systemic risk of a large financial institution collapse.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of banks in trouble and waiting for public assistance can expect the government to limit their withdrawal money, which the overseas sling calls simply a humid umbrella.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits also depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys in a auction, they will levy an additional tax on the golden parasol unless they make a retirement order for the registered bank manager.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene in order to ensure that management funds are not excessive.
As part of the picture, there are no changes in existing Mammal umbrella agreements, the restriction applies only to new ones, so that participation in the programme is still required.
This is the first case in the U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of directors - he commented on the measure by the President of the Financial Services Committee of the General Court, Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
In addition to participating banks, the state acquires the right to purchase, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may eventually gain from the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank, together with it, are in a position to recover.
The draft law provides that the President must submit a request to the Congress for reimbursement of expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector for the next five years.
There were, of course, both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us to do, or it does not protect taxpayers' dollars - has been issued by the representative of the Republic of Darrell Issa, California.
Mr Kaptur, a Democrat colleague of Ohio, thought that the measures were the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices have increased further.
In August 2008, the sales prices of the industry increased by 0.1 per cent from the previous month, by 12.9 per cent compared to August 2007 - that is KSH.
Industrial export sales prices were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 per cent compared to one year earlier.
As a consequence of the changes in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than in the previous month, 3.2 per cent higher than one year earlier.
The sales prices of the industry were only moderately increased by 0.1 % compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the raw materials industries also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent in July.
The largest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product, in the footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to a price increase of 4.6 per cent in the production of bags, silk and 2.5 per cent in the production of footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product production industry (1,6 %).
There has been a fall in oil processing (1.4 %), production of electrical machinery, instruments (0.9 %), and - to a lesser extent - wood processing (0.1 %) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishing, printing and printing activities remained unchanged.
The increase in prices between 0,2 % and 0,9 % was measured in the other manufacturing sectors.
In August, prices increased by 0.3% in the representative electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, with a significant weight on the sales of the industry, mainly as a result of the transitory effect of the increase in official gas prices carried out from 1 July.
Compared to twelve months, the most significant increase in prices in the petroleum processing sector was 32,4 % for the domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors.
The production of metal-processing products in the sector has been seen to increase by 13.2 percent in the production of food, drink and tobacco, which represents a significant weight, by 11 percent.
A reduction in the production of textiles, textile products (by %) and electrical machinery and instruments (by 0.3 per cent) sectors has taken place.
In the other manufacturing sector, the increase in prices was between 0.6 per cent and 9,1 per cent.
In manufacturing, prices have increased by 10.2% over the past year.
The prices of the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors exceeded 18.7 per cent of the previous one year's prices.
In August, investment goods in the Union industry were shown in the average monthly price increase (in %) in the average of the sales of the sectors concerned.
Consumer goods increased by 0,3 % in the Union industry and prices in the energy and re-use sectors remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the largest price increase compared to the previous year’s average year’s average price increase was observed in the energy and re-use sectors (16.8 per cent).
Consumer goods in the production sector were measured at a price increase of 6.8 per cent, a decrease of 1.4 per cent in investment goods.
The industry's export sales prices in August increased by 1.1 per cent compared to the previous month and decreased by 3.9 per cent in comparison to 12 months.
Our domestic currency decreased by 1.7 per cent in comparison to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, by 7.5 per cent in August 2007, compared to the euro, by 15.9 per cent in comparison to the dollar.
Don't you need a visa for the United States next year?
Göncz Kinga sees a good chance that the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force on 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke of this in Chicago, before the leaders of the local village.
He thinks "now that everything depends only on whether or not the electronic access and control system is established overseas in time."
He noted, however, that the new system would not allow entry, but tourists would have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomat has been negotiating in Washington since today.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Hungarian Republic's Medal to the Central Secretary for the Star and will hold discussions with Foreign Policy Advisers of the Democratic Party and the President of the Republic of Mr Barack Obama.
There's a bank rescue package next to Barack Obama and McCain.
Mr Barack Obama and Mr John McCain, both presidents of the two American parties, provided support for the government's $700 billion bank rescue package, but there is a politician who demands the Minister of Finance to resign.
After negotiations in marathon for days since Congress and Administration, it was announced on the morning of the Sunday morning: an agreement on the rescue package was concluded in principle.
The crisis on the street and the financial package to melt the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also claim to be better suited to taking the country out of the economic crisis as their guardian.
According to recent surveys, Obama has once again gained some advantage from the privilege of melted McCain after the Republican Convention, with the nomination of the Vice-President of Sarah Palin, after the Republican Convention.
Obama expressed his hope that the 700 billion-pack law would be passed quickly by Congress at a convention meeting in Detroit on Sunday.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer protection passports which he also supported.
"Now we must act with responsibility (...) for your work, your savings, the entire industries, the threat to the stability of the economy as a whole," he said before 35 thousand people.
He did not forget to call McCain's economic ideas a lost cause.
Justain explained in his interview with the ABC that "it will all be difficult to swallow (...) but nothing is simply a way.
The Republican Senator announced that the proposal included the setting up of a committee of the Minister of Finance's Supervisory Board and the restriction on the final payout of seniors, which he insisted on doing so.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role to play in the negotiations, but he was in contact with the minister day after day.
The President of the House of Pelosi told us that the House is expected to vote on the bill on Monday.
The German language security detail.
On the right side, the voters became more self-conscious only within the camp - thus analysing the weak involvement of Der Giegel in CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are willing to govern Austria to require a red-black coalition.
Der Giegel (spiegel.de)
In the release of the Internet of the German news station on the left, Franz Bauer, the Bajor State Revolution is eating up the causes of CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known politician, CSU's erosion started long before the wicked Beckstein-Huber took over his office.
For many years, the Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are turning away.
The changing era is also a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, including the issue of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that was likely to have been possible almost almost quite a year ago: the undisputed hegegy of a party of States has ceased to exist.
For ten years, in 1998 CSU landed at 47,7 per cent, first at a level of 50 per cent for the 50s.
This has been repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, which is why it was mentioned in the Stoic era.
This is due to the consistently modernization carried out by CSU in the province, which eats its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have been making a big mistake in the desert. However, there may be no effect on the loyalty of the voters CSU to secularization, educational results, the entry of the East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in potential, and the political consequences of this are also visible.
On the right side, the voters became more self-conscious, more critical, more expressive within the camp. Only within the camp did they become more self-conscious, self-evident and self-evident.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups have been most distant from CSU; free professionals, industry, graduates and seniors.
Here, the CSU's support dropped below 40 percent by now.

The section entitled "Who, with whom?" by the presidents of the Party on the issues of the repressed coalition" deals with the confused domestic political situation following the Austrian elections.
The Council intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPI in its internal affairs.
BZÖ appears to be open to negotiations in every way; the Greens do not want to negotiate a coalition yet.
The election took place, now everything is about the coalition; during the public television debate, the party leaders hardly allowed access to their cards.
President Werner Faymann confirmed that he intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The PÖR is willing to show that it is very possible to cooperate between the two parties - in some regions and in social partnership.
The question of whether you could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molter - with the current President of the ÖVP, as you could imagine at the beginning of a trial - was left by Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molter course will be challenged in any case.
Repeating this course will not be a question of repeating it.
Molterer responded with caution to red offers.
As you said, it will certainly not be effective to cooperate if Fayemann tries to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
By choosing the opposition or entering the coalition, so far completely open in the party, the questions must be discussed within the ÖVP.
The President of Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself to be open in all directions.
"To prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for government responsibility", said Haider.
Járóka: You need to break the encyclopaedia of poverty, segregation.
Today, in Paris, the European Equal Opportunities Summit in which France, representing the President-in-Office of the European Union, is hosted this year by France, has started.
Lívia Járóka, the European People's Party Commissioner, called attention to educational segregation in a communication from one of the main speakers of the professional deliberations, because this is one of the most serious violations of the Roma children, and this is also the most serious obstacle to their arrival.
A high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
They invited representatives of the Governments, European social partners and civil society organisations most important in the field of equal opportunities.
Járóka warned, according to the press office of the Fidesz Group of the European Parliament, that, in addition to the distinction between recruitment and employment, Roma leave the labour market at the highest level of their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have a middle-aged age, and due to poor quality basic education, only a minor proportion of them can obtain higher education.
He also stressed that as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Involvement in the early childhood education of Roma children may mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
The representative believes that it is necessary to communicate these issues with the broadest of the Roma and non-Romans.
As early as the Roma student begins school, she has the chance to become productive members of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
"Romans of the European Union must have the right to have access to quality education and must guarantee the elimination of their low-quality and separate education", said Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member, the objective and action-oriented association of the European Union is necessary to speed up school desegregation processes immediately, and the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination departments is essential.
"it is necessary to break the evil of poverty, segregation, unemployment, and give the Roma children the opportunity to contribute as a full citizen to the future of Europe" - called Járóka.
In the context of the European Year of Gender Equality for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, held every year since last meeting in Berlin, aims to provide a single platform to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a temporary temporary period of time.
At the end of October, they will decide on the fate of Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the disgusting fall of the election, heads have not fallen yet, the Bajoran Csu peaks have so far postponed the discussion of personal issues.
President Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may still be in place, asking how long the grace takes.
The fate of the 17-percent disaster-absorbing class will be decided by an extraordinary party campaign on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the many well-reviewed couples observed that they did not insist on all their strengths to their chairs.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the political group and the base, who, one day after the "bajor tsunami", demanded personal consuls because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, even under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian social union has reached 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the Stoiber coup, he only ran 43.4 percent of their power.
For 46 years CSU was a "one-stop shop" in Bavaria, Germany, which taxs 18 percent of German GDP.
At the same time, the Conservatives are still highly dependent on the Hungarian economy in the key southern region, and they will certainly be subject to a coalition in the future.
One of the first signs of internal transformation is that Vice-President Horst Seehofer, who is a potential successor of Huber, and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, will also be present in the tight investigation campaign with the liberal FDP and the free electors who are formed along the right-wing values, starting a pamphlets negotiations on a possible government coalition in Munich.
It is the fate of the admirable fact that on the Free Electoral team, the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used by Huber-Beckstein as a couple of coup and then treated the ambitious Hungarian politician with the most ambitious interest.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to stabilise Beckstein in some way.
The transition will also have an active role to play in the background, as well as Stoiber, former Prime Minister of the Province and former President of the CSU, on the 28th of September, as the most fortunate day of his political career.
On Monday, he missed a few points on the CDU, thinking they would have earned much more support from the couple.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and to Angela Merkel as well.
After the Bundestag election in September 2009, Merkel will not be a chancellor if the CSU, which plays a significant role in the success of 2005 in national affairs, is otherwise not able to recover with common strength.
The disappointment of the fiasco as a result of the fact that Merkel felt that CSU's destruction would not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
What is, of course, relative: it will not be easier to deal with injured CSU, and the crisis of the Socialist Democrats will continue.
SPD has achieved the weakest results since then by 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukashenko present: 110-0
None of the opposition Members entered the Belarusian Parliament following the elections on Sunday.
According to the Russian observers, this is due to the wealth and stability provided by Aleksandr Lukasenko in the country, but according to the European Security and Cooperation Organisation (EESC) it is possible to explain the illegality of voting when counting votes.
The EBES sending surveillance from 43 countries did not accept the elections.
Despite the fact that the ten-million-person legislation of the 10 million countries has been advocating the opposition for many decades, the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODS) voted in favour of yesterday's elections to ensure that, as a result of the amendment to the Constitution, Lukasenko, who renewed the presidential office of the European Parliament for a quarter of the European elections in 2006, 'will allow' some of his opponents to appear in Parliament.
Thus, the ODZ has stopped the pre-advanced boycott as well.
The background to the opposition expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly heavily dependent on Russia - which took loans for the reduction of continued Russian gas imports of gas and contributed to the delivery of the Russian transporter, who owned cross-border gas pipelines - also wished to improve its relationship with the EU, to which Lukasenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive an entry permit due to the political development of the Russian anti-democratic country.
In advance, it pointed out that during the election campaign, the OSCE placed more emphasis on positive moves than on shortcomings - for example, banning the third of the opposition candidates from their departure - in the context of the election campaign.
However, the OSCE's fast-track statement on Monday has already opposed the campaign - in which opposition candidates were essentially not available in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present on the count of votes.
At the same time, the opposition is of the opinion that there is a marked improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is also willing to engage in a smaller conflict with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia breaking out of Georgia, even though Russia, which represents a state of the Union on the Russian paper, considers the two territories to be independent for one month.
- We took two steps forward, one behind, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said Aleksandr Mininkevich to our people.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain the case, despite the fact that "the power was afraid of allowing even an opposition to be allowed into a credible Parliament.
The opposition does not plan any counter-attack measures in view of the results, rather attempts to send a message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
- We have a lot of problems, of course, we have to print the opposition papers in Russia, and the local authorities are creating obstacles to the presentation, but I can see that more and more people are supporting change, including the elderly - said Miinkevich, suggesting that the Lukasenko regime, which considers the creation of social security as its main result, does not seem to be adequate even for the most officially supported pensioners.
- the country's indebtedness, the increase in trade deficit, the question of time is the breakdown of social security "scaring silence" - said Miinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition policy, the Russian observers gave the elections a democratic vote.
Sergei Lebegyev, Head of Mission of the Community of the Independent States, told the Russian press Ria Novosztyi: "It is not the words but the actions that people believe", so the lack of opposition is no more than evidence of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
): "Morning hours before working hours".
In the history of the Chigi Palace, in a unique way, round-doors were equipped for the exit and entry of workers.
As of today, this new measure will take effect against the practitioner, the screening of those who block and then go out and have a cup of coffee at work.
Today, the anti-sun novelty was presented by Ms Renato Brunetta, Minister of State and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The rotary gate - said Brunette - is intended for better and better work, reduction of deficits and services."
"The next is a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," emphasised Brunetta.
With the Chigi Palace, the equipment of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers will be completed.
According to the machine, "the installation of the rotary gate is also symbolicly important".
No resistance has been experienced by employees - confirmed by the Secretary-General: "Workers have approved the action, everyone has cooperated."
In other words, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and no more brittles.
Vuneta smiling advises: "A good cup of coffee at the morning of the morning, wonders"
University of Public Administration
At a meeting held at the Minister's meeting, he said: "In three months, the number of public sector workers' losses due to illness decreased by 50 percent, which in one year means more than 600,000 people in employment."
At the same time, he pointed out that it should be made more effective for the Italian public administration to be more effective.
"which, according to the Minister, has been twice the size of the private sector in the past 8-10 years and has significantly exceeded the inflation rate."
Several thousands of civil servants gathered together to join the statement supported by the Association of the Environment and Consumer Associations of the United States of America to protest against the provisions of the Brunette Regulation.
"While the Minister of State proud of the data to support the reduction of the deficits due to illness, the war of the 'untired sunsets' continues to increase", says the Consumer Protection Association.
Thousands of civil servants working hard and hard across Italy have gathered together to declare war against the illegal provisions of the regulation."
In regional courts, inter alia, the withdrawal of supplementary nutrition for sickness due to service-related illness, the extension of the period of residence of workers on leave, which means the period during which the patient may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Job accidents: According to Napolitano, prevention is more important than anything else.
In the United States, 2.500 accidents at work occur every day, of which 3 deaths and 27 permanent disabilities end.
According to the accident insurance company at work, almost 1,200 deaths occurred at work in 2007.
The numbers testify to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death and requires almost twice as many victims as manslaughter.
Today, Anmil is organising the 58th anniversary of the victims of accidents at work in all regions of Italy, the traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of the institutions, social organisations and the public communication to this dramatic problem.
"Anmil's worrying data, as well as the tragic events of the past few days, also support the vital role of prevention in accidents at work," stated Giorio Napolitano President Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Republic of Napolitano, in his address sent to the President of the National Federation of the Athletic People's Party at Work.
The Prime Minister was responsible for "the permanent commitment of the association to prevention at work, the interest of workers affected by the accident, to help members of the families of the victims and to the adoption of public opinion".
"It is natural and truthful for all to suffer this type of outrage, namely, the tragedy of media and public interest, but in reality it is day-to-day dramatic, repeated and repeated events.
Napolitano confesses openly: "We definitely have a lack of resources, financing education and information is crucially important for financing it.
In-school initiatives aimed at providing direct information to young people who are likely to enter the world of work are particularly important.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to allow attention to be paid to the social importance of the issue and to the need for more effective legislation that needs to be enforced.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the agency, stressed for themselves that "the serious social importance of fatal accidents at work, all of us with a conscience, and the institutions are required to put an end to this as soon as possible".
"The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still amazingly high," noted Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"We do not, however, want to see this decline in the trend of decline in terms of diminishing due to the fact that the greatest tragedy is happening at the very moment of attention."
"We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything possible to combat this phenomenon, which could be resolved through a complex action programme.
We believe that more supervision and control should be needed - stressed by Mercandelli - as well as more ambitious interventions in the field of labour market training, starting with school education."
He added: "There is a need for further efforts to inform the public and to take stock of public opinion".
What is most necessary, however, is a more responsible environment for employers in relation to a phenomenon that is a social problem.
Then Mercandel criticised "the gradual deterioration of the compensation net for the victims of accidents at work" and the "aid budget for which the system has been hurried in recent years".
"the aim is therefore to give workers back insurance security, because the fate of those affected by the accident must not depend on the discretion of the legislators, where it is the responsibility of the dealer."
hearing loss may be caused by MP3 players.
A permanent hearing loss may be caused by the long and high level of listening to portable player devices such as MP3 devices -
stated in its report on this issue, the European Commission, the EU Scientific Committee for New and Newly identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) on the basis of the advice published today by the Commission.
"The opinion shows that those who spend five to ten per cent of their hearing loss over a period of more than one hour per day for five years may be able to listen with high voice to their portable composer" - can be read in the account.
"It is worrying that those young people who use high volume portable music players and mobile phones are not aware that they can be irreversibly damaging to their hearing," said Meglen Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk, which we urgently need to respond to," said the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this matter widely.
In the light of that opinion, we should also review existing control systems in order to be able to function effectively and to keep pace with the latest technologies.
Having called on the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the threat caused by them, it invited the independent scientific committee to examine the problem.
The Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to be taken to protect children and young people exposed to the exposure of portable players and similar means," said the Committee member.
The current European safety law sets maximum noise levels to be released by mobile composers at 100 dB, but the growing concern is the data on hearing damage caused by the excessive use of such sound resources.
However, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure, which can significantly reduce these hearing damage.
In the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, the exposure to noise exceeds the current maximum value for workplace noise, which is currently in force, for a period of five hours with a high volume (more than 89 Decibel) for users using portable player.
If someone listens to music under such circumstances for a longer period of time, there will be a risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This concerns about 5-10 percent of the users of the portable device, which could mean 2,5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital.
Today begins, until March, and the results are expected in June.
This schedule was set out by the Mayor's Municipality for the operation of the Committee "The Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at the new headquarters behind the Carasalla Bathing.
The following month, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop their respective Union directives.
After the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the general assembly and in the municipal committee so as to be able to submit in June an officially approved capital strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor General Gianni Alemanno.
"This is an entirely independent committee, which represents all kinds of political, social and cultural foundations - stresses Alemno - and its task is to develop proposals for the development of Rome on which political decision-makers, such as the General Assembly and the Committee on Governments, can rely.
There is no legal conflict; we just wanted a platform where big plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after he has done his job, the Committee will be disbanded as it has a mandate for a limited period of time.
In June, we will submit a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee "The Future of the Capital Capital of Rome" - declared the Prime Minister.
Those who consider the operation of the Commission superfluous, assuming that the opinion it has put forward does not have binding effect, Alemanne replied: "It depends on what the Commission will do and on what quality it will put on the table.
If quality proves to be the right thing, as is the case in France with the Attal Committee, which I am sure of in Rome, its contribution will have an important role to play.
The power of politics is often mixed up in day-to-day affairs and in urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further further forward to the future, and plan for the long term, and are committed to the development and future of Rome."
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be considered as an impeccable "waterhead" because it is absolutely free, it will not cost citizens any euro, but it is an inspiration and aims to involve the best minds of the capital."
According to Aleman, "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework enabling our city to jump the quality of what it needs, thinking of the future of a single spirit."
Concerning the future in which Rome's FYROM stresses: "It will not only be limited to the current institutional framework, but it will look much further away", we see not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also the role which Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean region might play as capital capital, and which it must fulfil."
Obama, the first president against America, we'll show you why.
A well-known independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
It was the first time he had decided to destroy the American economy, and he had close relations (as he does as he does today) with the enemy Islam.
As the election time approaches, attacks against Obama will become more frequent.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama believes that he can gain the highest public law worth of a nation whose so far two governors and five senators were black!"
These attacks are really notable; of course they are racist, but do not answer the voter's question about whether or not they will be a good President. Then there are the polls of public opinion: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant excess.
In this case, there is someone who listens to his emotions and not to his mind.
Inside the South States, a Mississippi newspaper wrote this in its main article: you are aware that the voter's the real American patriot who casts his vote in the vote.
There is a side of American thinking here that remains hidden for the last moment.
"Just tell me what you want, and we'll know where to put the guide, Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear to him: if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
No such words have ever been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
However, despite all this work, the democratics are the winning weapon of George Bush himself.
1 500 people were asked about the mistakes committed during Bush's term of office? 89 per cent replied to Irak.
Everything is changing.
This nation lost 5 thousand soldiers in Vietnam, and it was so fucked up that it flew all the way to the country.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
However, most people believe that Iraq was the weakness of Bush.
There is a huge task ahead of him who is going to replace George W.
The United States: the economic collapse is already felt by journalists, and the time has come for cuts in the offices. Many people blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists how they feel about the future situation and spiritual power of their profession.
Now, almost every journalist has a pessimism about his own future.
However, it was not clear that their credibility would have decreased.
They don't feel as isolated as they were before.
The public journalists have a problem with money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure of a powerless economic model.
There is still a serious problem with the constraints on the newsroom, i.e. the journal-making offices.
If you do not want the traditional press to shrink to a minimum in terms of what the general public understands, this problem needs to be solved - they say the journalists who are asking questions.
Today, there is a clear and complex cosmology of the U.S. Journal.
Sixty percent of press journalists and seniors are convinced that national jurisprudence is on the wrong track.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in senior management position.
Printing press press.
Press staff have no difficulty in seeing where the world network is going.
The largest publishers are taking a trip to the Internet, which many people believe is the "murder of the press" of the press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has grown to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists admitted that they were using technology to make their voices available in the hope that it might be for the benefit of the jury.
Today, in the U.S. period, there is a gap between the Heads of Administration, i.e. the Directors and the media working for them.
56% of leaders at national level are sure that their media will share information with others, while at local level this ratio can only be 23%.
Some of these are related to a secure workplace.
47% of drivers at national level fear that they may lose their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In fact, the question of "working hard" is on the agenda at the level (in the case of our editors, etc.) on a regular basis.
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a large nation such as the United States of America of 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers operate, employers generally offer as much as they want, so it works on a "take or not" basis.
Directors generally receive high salaries and officials can earn ten thousand dollars a month, in addition to the pension and health insurance contributions paid.
Freedom, on the other hand, is a rather complicated principle: in the first year x day, also in the third year, until after a certain period of time it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But U.S. journalists, according to their own declaration, often "feel sick" during the year.
Everything is a function of the climate.
YNIPOL: THE REDUCTION: DANILO COPPOLA GRANTED BY THE BODY OF YOUR BODY.
Mr. Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Penalty Division of the Roman Court of Justice, rejected the request from Danilo Coppola, who wanted to come to a Roman apartment from his place of residence, the Fattaferrat.
Coppol is being investigated for an economic bankruptcy in the context of an investigation into an agreement on trade between Unipol and BNL.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, the house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban for the Gottaferrata.
Her lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorellla, requested that the real estate sector pass through the rural small town to its capital housing.
However, according to the court, such accidents (for which the prosecutor proposed an advocacy) would allow the company to influence and have access to evidence brought against it.
In danger, the elite are at risk.
The phenomenon was obvious a few days ago when the House of Congress did not vote for the 700 billion-dollar rescue package proposed by the White House: a large part of the Americans were more interested and still interested in the punishment of Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis has resulted in an outbreak within the Republican Party, which is increasingly taking place between the traditional, restrained, Eastern Coastal attitude in support of the federal institutions and business circles and the growing anti-deficit approach against Washington and the financial world in Central and Southern states.
This approach was shown in a positive way during the parliamentary vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still under way is forecasting or seeing, not only in the United States, but also in the whole of the world, but also in the whole of the world, and even beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, will only speed up the long-standing phenomena that are being established in this new climate and will finally be brought to light.
The first such phenomenon is the modernisation, the return of the dual category of State sovereignty to the public, a kind of economic re-re-re-re-dating.
The crisis concerns the banking financial institutions that maintain a close relationship with the rest of the country, but mainly, and quite widely, they lead people and families who live in a single country, a single state.
This, however, constitutes a direct political difficulty for those on the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are otherwise voters.
So, in economic terms, the economy appears to be global, but in political terms, it is almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism was essentially off the coast: this is evidence of the European Union, which is unable to define a coherent policy stance between different interests and separate national strategies.
So everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules from each national government, but above all the opening of funds: since only the individual states have economic resources in place, with a financial set that can put things right.
They also have their tools and their powers to use them: in circumstances, they have two inestimable sources that are likely to have no other market nor any other international organisation to such an extent.
In addition, the new focus on the nation state of the crisis is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is a factor of increasing importance which is closely linked to this entity: this is the territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we were already entering the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology principle, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to govern the world, we just had to realize that our future is increasingly dependent on things that are not least abstracted, such as water, crop and oil.
Something that can be carried from one side of the planet to another, yet it can be completely linked to a limited location, a territory.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more hit cards than who, by accident, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I would also like to pass on to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fracture line.
Who says that territory, state, government, necessarily also says: politics, in other words, leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two conflicting phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, one of those who can take over the events.
On the other hand, current management, in particular economic leaders, has resulted in a total loss of credit, which has proved to be completely incompetent and has proved that many of them still have a blurry area ahead of them.
The two together are of even greater importance and, in a sense, are more worrying: the feeling of lending, disbelief, impossibility and separation, which is affecting the entire leading elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that the population is becoming increasingly convinced that the social elite has expired so far.
This is not expected by the voters in their "flags", or in the recent sudden changes in the public debate. For example, the power of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the labour force in Great Britain, or the attack by American congressmen on Bush (and perhaps the victory of the lower right).
It seems that the traditional elites, parties, programs, and even the fact that his habits, press and his famous intellectuals in college seem to be getting less and less understood, and that is why he is becoming less and less able to represent what has been happening for some time in the deeper aspects of Western society.
However, speaking of "the imminent uprising of the crowds" would, frankly, be too much.
But keeping an eye on it doesn't hurt at all.
We can walk on the wall with strong glues.
By means of a strong glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man, with the help of a strong glue.
This goal has been set by several U.S. research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to the solution.
With just a 2.5-square-centimeter glue, researchers managed to attach and maintain a 100-pound body to a vertical wall.
The U.S. Journal on Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance invented by the group has been further developed by the development of the special, so-called ‘heavy-heavy-heavy-heavy materials’ that are already present.
"The principle of the operation of glue must be seen as a pipe system similar to a package of spaghetti", says Zhong Lin Wang, a research researcher of the Institute of Technology in Atlanti Georgia.
Researchers have drawn the idea from the feet of the gecko with microscopic blinds that provide the animal with a perfect grip.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, teflon and grinding paper, have shown that the new glue is more effective than the feet of these seals, but also "lightly separated from the wall" - explained Liming Dai, researcher of the university engineering body at Dayton University.
"This substance can be useful as temporary glue" - added Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall just like Spider-Man? Perhaps, but researchers think more of a less attractive use than connecting electronic devices, because coal tubes lead well to heat and electricity.
You can also find out more about space exploration.
Heroes can still wait.
OTHER INFORMATION - the University of Berkeley, California, is also conducting experiments with a new glue.
According to an article published in American Chemical Society, California scientists have presented a self-cleaning glue made of hair-shaped, micro-fibre material, which is made of material that undergoes self-cleaning during movement on the surface, so that it always provides perfect grip.
Foods? Fruit juice is prohibited.
Grapefruit, orange and almale must be protected.
These high-vitamin, especially popular in the summer, when they enter the body with certain life-saving medicines, change their absorption, increase or decrease their effect as a result, and may have serious health problems.
David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario of London, noted the risks of combined use of carton or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products. The professor announced at the 236 national meeting of American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a large Grapefruit, orange or apple can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicinal products, thus preventing their beneficial effects and putting the patient’s health at risk.
Grapefruitle has already been placed on the table of the defendants when it turns out that it is able to enhance the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anxiety, heart rhythm control, and an anticonvulsant to a toxic level.
CROSSINGS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Forestry published the news in its official public and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this interaction and to take care to know what to drink when you are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Medon.
NO GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that prevent the effectiveness of medicines.
You can long for those active substances that hinder the absorption of grepefruit and other fruit juices.
Draw attention to Michele Carruba, Professor at the Department of Pharmacy of the University of Milan: "The findings of this kind are generally immediately communicated to the various national and international pharmaceutical agencies, who, if necessary, will arrange for the modification of the information contained in the information provided by that medicinal product.
This is why you must always take the information on the intended to take a medicine, and if something is not clear, we will not let you be influenced, but we will certainly ask our doctor or pharmacist", emphasised Ansa's expert.
Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize for the Economic Economy.
The American Paul Krugman received the economic Nobel Prize for analysis of the territorial contexts of trade models and economic activity.
The 55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman, teaches at the University of Princeton, and is a well-known publicist for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most delicious critics of economic and foreign policy measures in the government of Bush.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in his general article published in the New York Times that the last event would have even more decisive consequences in the history of the United States than the collapse of the twins.
This forecast did not give rise to a lack of debate, on several occasions being taken into account by the economist, but today we know that it was correct.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked that Enron or Worldcom's scandalous collapses have gone over the public interest so quickly," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
Member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Krugman is a "prudent-value economics", but also quite "aggressively conveys his criticisms of the government's demilitarization of the Bush government."
Open Office also understands the third edition of the "Microsoft Anti-Microsoft" package.
Today, the open-label application package that increases productivity of the population of Max.org 3.0 is published, which aims, as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, at an ever wider range of dimensions, from home to office users, from free business to public administration.
Following the work of SUN Microsystem and voluntary developers for up to a year, the new Open Office will become more new to the public: in addition to the happy screen and the re-thinked user interface, it will offer more important new information, such as the compatibility with the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format as well.
Particular attention has been paid to interoperability with the Office 2007 system, so Open Office can also open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
A few more modules have a specific function, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the Power Point presentations. This can be useful for sending files by e-mail. Another feature supports the import of PDF files into the image module by adopting the side layout.
We can also create hybrid PDF documents on this site, which combines the typical Adobe format with the theme manager or text editor elements.
The in-use sharing has also been a number of developments: the platform manager supports joint use of working leaflets, but prevents the revision of each other's work. Each employee's comments are marked with a different colour, which helps to understand better during the control phase.
Some companies are already working on making some of the features of the harvest available on the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version could probably be introduced in the next few weeks.
The Italian version of this version, which has been available on the Mirrr sites since Friday, can be found at the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
The package is available for Linux in addition to the standard Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, either in our home or at work, we can take over the distribution CD.
Freedom is probably the greatest attraction for home use, but the Open Office package is now trying to kick in the business sector, as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There are no ideal education, advice and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises that can open up new business prospects.
The Open Office consists of five basic elements: Writer, Word-compliant Text Editor;  Calc, the screen manager for the replacement of Excel; Impress, Point-like presentations; Dbase is the most well-known Access Data Manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 target is to get 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that the new version will be more than 3.60 million by now, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Also positive is the result, this is already the fourth case of doping.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, a positive sample was produced again by one of the participants, Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the performances of the Gerolsteiner team, who also won the best mountain title.
The news is about the press release on the Money Internet.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, the Italian Riccardo Ricc and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German, also the Gerolsteiner competitor Stefan Schumacher, who has produced a positive result in Cera test for the third generation version of EPO.
Kohl's blood samples, like the tests carried out over the last few weeks, have been tested by laboratory laboratories in the report and in the chatainey-malabry.
If the inspection tests confirm the positive result of Cera, Austria will lose its third place and will be banned from competition for two years according to the standards.
The positive outcome of Kohl's second-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and informed the Associated Press news agency: he has indicated a positive doping effect on the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has managed to stand behind the Spanish Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and won the best stoned suit in the mountains.
BODIES: TOWARD THE NEW YORK'S PARTICIPATION OF THE REQUEST, THE WAY OF THE OILIA?
It has only recently changed from a country of immigrants to one of the most popular shoes of the reluctantly accepted immigrants.
This is why the "Belpaese" is transformed into a racist nation? This is what the New York Times is asking this question, starting from the case of the young Burkina Faso Abdul Berdul Guibre, who was killed last month in the U.S. because he stole a box of biscuits and placed a long story on the debate around racism in Italy.
The fact is that what the New York Times calls "the "a paradox": in the northern regions "the strongest is integration and the highest is employment" is well illustrated, while in the northern regions "the strongest is in the country" is also the "emigration and the support of the North League".
In support of the increasing tension between the Italians and immigrants, the NYT also refers to cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would bring the weaker people closer to immigration and facilitate the removal of illegal immigrants, have been put on the ground as an example of a climate change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Presidents of the Pope and the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. He met with you in the Palace of the Curriculum and claimed that the State and the Church cooperate in the fight against racism".
Students are subject to expensive rental fees, and a room can cost up to 900 euros.
The market for accommodation for colleges is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey of Sunia, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now come to such amazing sizes as, due to the heavy cost of families, the wide range of students being excluded from learning," explains Laura Mariani, head of the Sunia Research Office. "In these cities, the high demand of students has distorted the market to such an extent that there has been a general process of downsetting against the local population as well."
In most cases, real estate also contains a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts with no restriction on rent, with a related sub-lease.
According to Sunia, there is a need for extraordinary measures which, by revising the tax system, would enable prices to be maximised.
From the details of the survey, Brianza is also asked for EUR 450 per cannon; the price of the single room is from EUR 650 (bande Nere neighbourhood) to an average of EUR 800 ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can also reach EUR 900 (Vittoria neighbourhood).
In particular, a bed costs an average of EUR 350/400 and a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where the majority of students live in the area near the university, a bed costs EUR 250/280 if it is a double and EUR 370-500 if it is a single room.
In Rome, close to central universities (San Lorenzo, one Bologna), about 600 Euros is requested for a single person and 450 for a single bed in a double room.
They are slightly cheaper (550 per single room) at prices in other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburban districts you can save all of this: it costs 300 euros a bed and 450 a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Napoy, they ask for EUR 300/450 per bed, one room from 400 to 600 euros. The price cap is the highest in Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you will have to pay EUR 250/350 for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, the average value of prices is too lower, but they represent more weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students often seek accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent charged to foreign students is about 25-30 per cent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, Cinema Paradiso, the cities have sacrificed the time of the old cinemas.
Conventional cinemas are closing in to the benefit of the Multiplexes.
"A city where there are no movies, blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures made by director Giuse Torntore are effective in presenting all the things that happen in the major cities of the region, but also in rural areas.
The repression of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-term cinemas in the suburbs and, as a result, the separation of terminators in the city centers - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time it has all the features of a real cultural crime.
When historical and memories disappear, "it's like a friend goes away, a friend with whom we have shared our journeys and many experiences", says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was an award of 20 years ago, and the grand prize of the Cannes Festival for Turin, tells the story of a small-town cinema Lyria, the year of the year, after a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, is clear: 316 global cinemas have been closed in the last five years. The largest loss could be accounted for by cinemas in the capital cities: 10 cinemas were closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
The main regions concerned are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-term cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that, for their disappearance, there is nothing more to prove the responsibility than that of Italy in these three regions is the highest number of newly created multi-term cinemas: in the last five years, the number of rooms increased in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and both Emilia Romagna in the last five years.
"The number of units in Italy has increased in a rational way," says President of Anec. "It is well understood that we are building new facilities, but we should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a urban cinema closes, not all those who go there are willing to go into the multiplexes.
Not to mention the outstanding financial funds intended to support operators: the debt of the State overdue can amount to approximately EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is a shame that the government does not comply with the laws in force.
A total of EUR 16-18 million per year would be needed to restore the market.
Special attention should be paid to the case of Bologna. This is the first Italian city to be able to resolve the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec, in order to protect and stimulate a single-term cinema in the foreign and downtown.
The provisions would include tax reductions for operators and the benefits for the audience to facilitate accessibility: viewers could enter the restricted zones and certain parking spaces with a reduced tariff.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Towere, "and I hope that other cities, even by taking other measures, will follow Bologna's example.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the power of the multiplexes, must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is far more demanding.
The conservation of the traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closing of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that eventually led me to do Cinema Paradiso, although I have been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've been living in Rome for 25 years, so when I go out on the via Nazionale before the closed rialto or the Quirinale so that I don't see your dust-red posters, I'm going to turn my head. I've had all my experience here."
Close lines between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested the city of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Pirodel Clan in municipal decisions.
Serious accusations have been made against the judge of the California Anti-Mafia Directorate General, Mr Gioia Tauro, and his Deputy Mayor, Mr Giorgio Dal Torrione and Mr Rosario Schiavene, and Mr Rosarno Magele Carlo Martelli, who have been arrested this morning for charges of external involvement in criminal justice.
He was also brought to the hands of Gioacchino Pirom, the senior broker between the clan and the public administration, and his brother-in-law, the same name as the chief, who was previously convicted of having been involved in a mafia-like crime, and who received a compensation of EUR 10 million.
"Annoying any legal and moral rule, what is more good taste," the state's attorneys write, and the two local authorities have expressed their desire to pay a consultant's fee to the Piromon lawyer.
"So the clan would have had an official access to the city hall, which could have provided an additional opportunity for the control and management of public administration, which could have been significant anyway.
Gazio Loiero, President of the general assembly of the Calabria Region, has no secret that there is a "number of interplays between the local institutions and the organized underworld" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where co-playing is almost inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, are resisting the pressure of 'androgheta', these are the heroes who remain clean.
Today's breakfast arrests are the continuations of the events in July, when the police announced that they had managed to end the Piromille clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to the administration of the government. Gioia Tauro's Committee of Local Governments was once dissolved in 1991, even because of organised crime and suspected interactions between the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrone, President of the Christian Democratic Union, who was on the rise during the second round of 2006 for the right-wing coalition.
A scandal cried out when the County House ordered the decommissioning of the municipal committee.
The then Minister of Home Affairs referred to Marco Minnii, who was a substitute for the then Minister of Justice, and accused of planning everything with political intent. However, the court, by order of arrest signed this morning, explained that the Piromilla clan had gone so far as to demand a change to project A3.
The interrogations against D.T. Torrion, written by the state's attorneys, reveal that "there was a right to comply with the obligations of entrepreneurs representing a large group of people known to be close to the Piroméll family, to submit the decisions of the municipality to the clan's interests."
The energy is coming from the north, and now the big ones are coming.
An inexhaustible source of energy, which represents 70 percent of the planet's surface, and which is still being discovered by large global energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tidals, as well as renewable energy sources, to which giants like the Chevron have turned their eyes on, who are now trying to put their hands on them.
For years, they've been researching how to generate energy from the marine movements. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
While oil prices have fallen, the idea of using energy from the sea has been set aside, but today the re-energisation of environmental needs and oil price will give new impetus to the sector.
According to the World Energy Council (WEC) of London in 2007, 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by facilities that use seaflying.
This quantity is twice as many as is currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there were the currents and tidals.
The giants are going down.
Enersis was the first company to commit itself to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in Northern Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary move when the signature was notified.
Two years have passed, and a growing number of companies are voting in favour of marine energy, including those who have so far been committed to traditional energy.
"Cevron is studying ocean energy-using technologies and considering the possibility of cooperation with us," declared the speaker of one of the companies of the U.S. oil lord, the Wall Street Journal's economic day.
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of the authorisation necessary for the launch of the Alaskan project for the use of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee.
It is not very important, especially if we consider that the United States is currently engaged in oil extraction in Alaska, and President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Inc. and the Ocean Power of New York are on the way from the sea. The amounts invested so far, as far as details are known, will be shown to have a positive impact.
The technology is awaiting development.
According to the expert, this is still a process of initial technology, only because the energy from the sea does not eliminate doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing establishments such as Portugal or Scotland are all small and therefore do not cause too much problems with regard to the ecosystem.
However, in order to be able to generate energy at a higher level, installations with a higher environmental impact are needed.
There are several options: Ocean policy, for example, uses a interlinked boot system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving up and down the bushes are transformed into hydraulic pressure from the pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure is shooting a turbine that feeds a generator.
Electricity reaches the ground by submersible wires.
There are also four similar types of installations in the planning phase that are already waiting only for the federal permit to be used in a military facility, a part of the energy generated would be used in a military facility.
However, Verdant Power has already started power generation for a shop and a parking lot by using the six subsea turbines located in the East Sea Sea of New York.
At the time of the price, the water's movement turns the water's blades around the thrubs, and this movement feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that he had a long list of partners who only expect the permission to use energy.
After the waves, it's raining.
At present, special attention should be paid to the opportunities to be exploited by the flood.
Although this is a temporary phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and can therefore be seen as a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other States spent $3.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy supplied by the flood, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
