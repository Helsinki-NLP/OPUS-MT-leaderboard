Right-wing popular victory in Austria, with a total of 29 percent in Austria, they have a total of 29 percent.
According to the first preliminary results, the Austrian advance parliamentary elections took place on Sunday, with a marked decline in the two parties of the major coalition and a significant increase in the right-wing populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, has been seriously thwarted, has suffered a particularly severe loss.
On the other hand, President of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Head of State of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing a win-win return to national politics.
On the basis of preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain with 29.8 percent of the votes in the Socialist Party, but it lost 5.5 percent of the votes in the last 2006 elections.
The ÖVP was even worse, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results achieved in the history of both large parties in the post-war history of Austria and, in particular, in the People's Party that has brought forward the forthcoming elections, the result is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP team left the coalition, the people had a significant advantage before the SPÖ, according to public opinion polls.
However, the voters obviously punished him for allowing the government to fail.
In the first reaction to the results, speculations have already been voiced regarding the possible resignation of President Molterer of Wilhelm Molterer and at the beginning of the current court.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary session of the political committee.
This development is likely to facilitate an increasingly likely way out of the result of the election, i.e. a renewal of the high coalition between SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) in advance received 18 percent of the votes and the BZÖ in advance - but the Social Democrats, however, also voiced their fear of repeating the 1999 year, when the party agreed with the people in common government (the FPÖ was still one in the past and became a member of the BZÖ in 2005), which even caused sanctions on behalf of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics, obviously expects this solution.
He was also elected to Parliament by the Green Party, which, however, was somewhat lost in his popularity, and the Austrian political parties returned from third to fifth place among them.
None of the other parties crossed the four hundred-foot limit and did not make it to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can get colder and colder.
If we fail to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have reported illegal beetles, Mr Karel Schwarzenberg, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that Czech Indian relations could find it possible to become a reality.
This was published by the Minister in New York after his meeting with Pranob Mukherji, Indian partner today.
"If this did not work out, then yes, it would certainly become cold," he stated after the meeting that took place from Czech incentives.
After the trial, Mucherji told me that the executing authority could be difficult to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who had been dismissed and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local management of the North East, whose jurisdiction is the case.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
However, in the opinion of Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji said it would be best for him to appeal to the Supreme Court.
You could apply for immunity for bail and you could wait for the judgment, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in a similar way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, then it would be possible to release him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal aid", mentioned by the Indian Minister of Justice.
He told them that the Indian party has already provided them with such help.
"Our primary interest in India is to maintain the best relationship with India over the years.
This is also acknowledged by the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as you told the ESC, your partner stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech  Entomologists.
"We consider it a serious mistake to capture and prosecute these Czech scientists," he stated.
The question of whether the Indian party gave a commitment to dealing with the case was answered by the Minister.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he noted.
judges in the battle for the seabed.
Enter the wall electronic map on which Australia and the neighbouring sea areas are visible.
However, he does not care about the continent, but he cares about one of the points that lie in the sea’s blues.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it is the neighboring seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," says Foreign Lawyer Luigi Santosusso, who is a member of thirty-six working groups of UN Division Ocean and Maritime Law.
Háze, Mikulka Václav Czech lawyer, director of the division, follows the explanation that sometimes depends on it.
There is work and enthusiasm in place here.
The seabed is rich in natural resources and has so far hardly been known to the world.
Oil, ore and other mineral substances are available here, but also living organisms that are still unknown, which could be the key to the development of an anticancer medicine, for example.
More than land-based seabeds
Today, coastal states are seeking intensively for new sub-sea areas.
According to the United Nations, rights are granted, which were agreed in 1982 at the Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is primarily about the area of the so-called continental landscape, which often extends a few hundred miles from the coasts of a country.
According to the Convention, such a country has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental sheet.
"We consider a simplified, continental survey of the part and the bottom of the seabed that is the natural continuation of the sub-sea continent.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often 200 miles across the borders of the so-called economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by that country to the Commission for the purpose of establishing the external borders of the Continent Notice shall be accompanied by a number of comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on cost-effective research and measurement.
It's a lot of years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the Committee.
So far, the Committee has negotiated five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka added.
In the world recently, the success of last night has led to an echo, which first significantly enlarged its sub-sea country.
But New Zealand has also been won - the area of the seabed allocated to it by the committee is approximately 1.6 million square kilometres, which is six times larger than the territory of the country.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
Their hopes are that the profits from future seabed use will be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting their applications.
Ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention" may be carried out within 10 years of the moment of ratification of the "Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental landscape ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity" begins.
None of the countries in this country already have an absolute situation.
The right to output shall be granted in this area by an international institution set up by the Organization.
"The seabed, however, is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, saying that "some areas are legally clearly defined and laid down in the treaty".
The next members of the Pacific Ocean.
The seaside is part of the Republic of the Republic these days.
This former Eastern block is shared in other countries within the framework of the common "Interceroceanmetal" organisation.
This organisation received, under the Convention, the so-called "machine investor status" status in 1991, like investors in some other countries.
Sufficient production was required in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is isolated there, it is a kind of undersea copy of the Tatra.
"This can be produced in a total of 75 000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich place for polymetal ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says another lawyer named Hindu Pashi Rajan.

German special forces were present at the hostage release.
The Egyptian government asked Germany to help resolve the hostage crisis - and the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
The release of eleven European tourists who have been kidnapped in the universe is increasingly being published.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs and Home Affairs, German special forces were involved in the rescue operation indirectly.
In addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, staff from the German Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as logistics experts from the German Technical Service were also on the scene of release.
According to the information provided by the military spokespersons on Monday evening, German forces were not required, however, as hostages allowed their prisoners to run and fled when they recognized the signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government accepted the assistance offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
"Unfortunately this was not the case," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts on 19 September in southern Egypt.
Following a kidnapping in the South-Egypt desert area, the hostages were transported here and there in the territories of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The absence of hostages has remained imprecise so far, as well as details of the release of hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the survivors arrived in Cairo in a healthy manner.
Steinmeier announced that the released hostages would be protected by the German embassy.
No comment was made on the details of the release.
For the time being, no information has been provided on when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" daily, five tourists and special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday at the German Air Force Air Force Airbus on Tuesday.
The U.S. Assembly rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. living room in the United States has largely failed the 700 billion dollar rescue package proposed for the financial markets.
Dow fell into the deep.
The U.S. Assembly rejected the government's rescue package for the financial markets by 227 votes to 206 against.
Despite the appeals made by Presidents of the United States of George W. Bush and the political leaders of both parties, he did not receive a majority of the programmes that wanted to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
The supporters have undoubtedly attempted to persuade the criticals of the $700 billion package during a dramatic action.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called for the support of Members, even if the plan is quite unbelievably unbelievably.
"It is not possible to obtain political support in order to avoid something that has not yet happened" - he admitted.
Dowtes fell more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the public rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote to fall again after it was released to the public.
The experts expect additional serious uncertainty in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme is subject to the approval of both the Assembly and the Senate.
The pilots are registering more and more reservations.
Good winter promises German tour operators a promise.
According to one study, the number of bookings for the following months has increased significantly from the previous year - by more than 30 percent in the winter season.
Despite the weak cyclical prospects, the Germans felt that the Germans were not in a position to travel.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies accounted for 31 per cent of the previous year's growth in turnover - reported in Berlin on Monday, the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute’s investigation, the number of reservations in autumn months is even higher.
The turnover of the travel agencies in October was around 11 per cent higher than in October 2007 and reported to the DV.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates monthly booking data for 1200 German travel agents and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute will take into account the journeys booked until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the USA in particular was sought - reported by the DVP.
Here the amount of bookings increased by one third in a round.
The Germans are particularly fond of their destinations in addition to Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as their country of origin.
Most of all, we were looking for organized journeys - said Klaus Laepple, President of the DVC.
Due to the increase in energy and food costs, in the case of organised journeys, costs can be calculated "better for passengers than for individual tours."
Passengers can save money by, among other things, booking discounts or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The reserve ratio of the summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to account for growth once again compared to the previous year - although another study indicates that fewer German tourists are engaged in a trip compared to the previous year.
My first Oktostein painting is my first Oktostein painting.
Without a break, repeated balleran hits, liter-breeded scurvy, and design-responsible legends with dirvded design.
Decent to Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not really much alike.
She's a blonde, TV programmer, and she's wearing a customized dirvd.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the jacket.
But one thing connects us: We've only been on Wies for three minutes, we've already been rushed by photographers and filling out their memory cards - it's very appealing, and this is my first visit to Wies.
That's how we can make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndle meets its purpose.
As Wiesn tourist from the white sausage to the north of the equator, I still have a limit on the public's touch.
But when Theresien got there, it wasn't that bad anymore.
Everyone else wears dindled or leather shorts; no one looks at you frightfully or embarrassedly - everything is perfectly fine.
A strange look at the chocolate banana stand just for my dirndle apron.

So it's one of the most notorious "in English for the labour market."
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the ambulances are going through the scene and taking care of poor hues.
Hospitals always show up on a team - four of them are carrying a covered cannon from a tent to a tent at the same time.
This works as for most Wiesn visitors: Check-in is empty, check-out is blocked.
Who's lying in the alcohol powder under the pony doesn't look like it.
"This is the ones who are completely ready", called out to me one of the sanitaires on my question and then on the stage.
The police mentioned the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
On Friday afternoon, the accident took place on Shen Road, in the city of Shen Road, the resident of Elumsford Road, in Brentwood.
She was transported to a hospital in Queen's Hospital in Aromford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving after the accident.
Since then, he was released for bail.
Turkish diocese period of growth.
Long before Turkey had intended to join the European Union, the European powers are burning from the desire to enter the country of Turkey deeply.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station is designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a neo-renaissance style designed by two German architects.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building encircles the end of the platforms, one tortoise at each front corner, and it looks like a German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's getting a little busy.
However, it is clear from the inside of the shop-based ticket office what a large company it was the most western gate of the company.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium, the Anatolyia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, the 'Long Future' of the Moons, through this train from Damascus to Baghdad to modern Saudi Arabia, intended to achieve its ambitions for the take-up of the Middle East.
The German capture efforts came together during World War I.
His railways were attacked by the coasters of Lawrence and Arab Emirates.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and forced out the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria.
The Hyperpasha Station was no better than it did.
In 1917 an explosive train exploded and destroyed the building's well-developed top.
According to the Turkish sources, a sabotage action has been taken.
Since then, it's been falling apart, and history's been way overboard.
However, today, as the gate of the railway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region - at least in a symbolic sense - Turkey is serving as an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The government's Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has developed a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is characterised by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran, and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I got on a night train to the capital of Turkey, Ankara, to visit a leading foreign policy expert of the AKP, the Turkish MEP, Suat Kinkilut.
The next day, after about ten and a half hours of rushing, which gave me the "The Night Mail" rhythm of the old world documentary, I arrived in the capital of Turkey. The new city is intended for the symbol of the new world state, which turns its back on the past.
However, the AKP, which has a well-known Islamic roots, represents a paradox shift in the Turkish consensus.
This raised some suspicion in the west, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP's building, an ultra-modern, stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose, which is located in a developing suburbs, between semi-prepared shops and cafes. These latter meet the middle leaders in the suit - both men and women - to conduct business early in the morning.
Suat Kinikolilu would have been a right-wing politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a dress, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy objective is to assist Turkey's re-integration into its immediate environment.
The cold war broke the order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its country of origin.
He had to turn east and west today.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open both ways.
"But maybe it's just a matter of time before the election?" - I asked.
"Turkish has tried to appeal for a time."
He then stressed what everyone I was talking to here, almost mechanically repeated: Turkey’s relations with not only the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the countries surrounding the Black Sea have the same advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
It is as if they wanted to convey the message that, in a sense, together with Turkey, the whole of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those eastern railways.
Once again, when I was at the Hydarpasha station, after another largely awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the restoration of this magnificent building 100 years ago.
How would they have wondered if they knew that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I was waiting in the harbor for the shuttle to return through the Bosporuston, I realized that at that time Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At least at the time there was no question as to which land would be required for this country of origin.
Mysterious journeys: Vernon Handley and Í - Bridgeruff
Mark Brown writes: Vernon "Tod" Handley has been the music director of Guildford since 1962 (supervised by the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir) in Guildford.
On the basis of his musical plans for the city, he founded his youngster, the Proteus, in the following year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have been included in the singing box, but when the Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were already at the end of our 20s - we simply refused to take the lead.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer's name) was in line with the organ's determination and ability to cope with any sheet music that they put before them - whether it be a madridal or a mess of the Messiah; without escort, or with a large singer's escort.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often surprising and always exciting, and thanks to the man whose inspiration for our inspiration for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often did Tod say to us, "Let the music speak by itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
He's got everything in the bag.
So sing it!"
The conductor's technique was always fully understandable and accurate, but never dydentic or excessive.
Whatever the quality of music, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If he ever lived a bear who was supposed to ride, it was Vernon Handley.
I enjoyed the two decades during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonics from Lisbon to 19 February.
Every single 40 times I've written a review of more than 100 tours of the last year, but never, it's been a disappointment to me, and it's often turned them down.
In Tod Handley, there was both greatness and modesty, which is very rare.
He hated the conductors who, living with his words, just "with a couple of well-known battles all over the world."
Many of us will miss you.
Can not open message
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your report by William Woodruff (September 25), "In 1946 he continued his economic history studies in Oxford and in 1950 he became a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while continuously preparing to acquire the title of basic education, master's degree and PhD."
This is from the author's notes of Woodruff's work "Beyond Nab End", but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, the University of Nottingham expressed economic history, while under the leadership of Director J. D. Chambers, he completed the dissecting of PhD on the British rubber industry, which was then published in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry".
In 1950-51, he was actually in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 he was in the schools of all kinds of schools in New York, New York and Harvard.
In singles, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois for the rest of his life.
There is no way to know why Woodruff made this period of his career easier for him.

Another time, a sales record at the Honda.
In November, Honda will start marketing the second-generation Jazz.
True, the passenger compartment was already quite large, but the design of the new model interior is even more extensive.
All of this comes with sophisticated techniques that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evoluation is a religious revolution.
This looks like the second-generation Honda Jazz.
Although it is very similar to that of the new Jazz, many internal changes have been made.
These include innovative design, new bodywork, larger sizes and new tools.
But before we change to a detailed description of the new model, we have to tell you that the new jazz has appeared six years after the first-generation market was launched.
First of all, we can say that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
At the same time, jazz is less known in Europe, but in other markets, it is setting the sales records for jazz.
The market is, for example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-for brand in 2002 and this year 2008 as well.
For example, since its entry into the market in Japan, almost a million pieces of jazz have been sold.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million examples sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to increase traffic in the region further with the new Jazz.
On the other hand, in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83.000 Jazz, and by 2009 the estimated 100,000 cars will be sold, leading to an increase of 17% on the European market.
In the Spanish market since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 jazz, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary are calculated by an indication sold in the course of a year by the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary over 2000 times.
In fact, the arrival of the new jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in Honda's sales in Spain.
The company's representatives are predicting 22,000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4000 less than the 2007 data, i.e. a 16% decrease.
Despite the conditions of sale, the Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.6% last year, to 1.8%.
I would also like to increase this rate by 2010 to 2%.
Honda hopes that this will be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a five-door and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid, of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 pieces worldwide each year.
According to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the distribution of the Insight market would be carried out by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The introduction of the Insight trade is due in the first months of the year following the formal opening of the January competency.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become broader in all respects.
Its length is 3900 mm (five centimetres longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimetres longer) and its width has increased by five centimetres, i.e. 2500 mm.
On the other hand, its height does not change 1520 mm.
In addition to the size, the emergency space also became more spacious.
The greater internal space is guaranteed by the new body and by the medium fuel tank - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
There has been an increase in the full container of the so-called double floor container, currently 399 litres, i.e. by 19 litres in excess of the first generation capacity.
Although this includes that these sizes relate to the type of engine 1, 4, since the 1-Honda Jazz's trunk is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be seen, such as easier access to rear lower-down lamps or optional panorama glass roofs and rear seats.
In addition, the angle of the doors in the rear seats has been increased to 80 degrees, compared with the angle of the first jazz at 67 degrees.
The second-generation Jazz engine is new.
At the start of its operation, this small model can be supplied with two engines of 1, 2 and 1,4 litres.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, both resources are more favourable than the previous model and are characterised by lower carbon dioxide emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine provides excellent performance in all respects.
The power of 1,2 litres at a speed of 90 horse power of 6,000 speeds and a maximum torque of 114 Nm at a speed of 4400 Nm.
This engine, which was 78 horses in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres of CO2 and 125 grams of CO2.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horses in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horses.
The 100 strong 1.4 jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres, and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The collision "magic trailer"
For the development of accident-prevention technologies, this time in Nissan was inspired by nature and precisely by bees.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents by copying the remains of bees.
The Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C signal may be the first step in developing impact prevention technologies.
An engineer at the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre of the University of University developed in cooperation with the Research Centre for Science and Technology, Japan, was able to save this small robot in Japan.
Mr Kazuhhiro Doi, Director-General for Technology PR and Research, said that BR23C is a further extension of the short-range protection cover of Nissan.
The robot will make the company's products' ability to crash more complete.
During a landing, every meal will develop your oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan protective cover.
However, the role of the bee's complex eye is far more important, in which it sees more than 300 degrees in all directions. Consequently, the bee can fly uninterruptedly in its own personal life.
To copy the function of the complex eye, the engineer designed a so-called laser diameter (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument identifies the obstacles within a distance of up to 2 metres in a 180-degree field before BR23C, calculating their distance and sending a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns into an action to avoid a collision.
"As soon as an obstacle occurs, the small robot immediately mimics the movement of the uterine by moving the wheels in a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is mostly distinguished from the instruments currently available by the fact that in this case the avoidive maneuver is carried out completely automatically.
If not, the person who could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and Project Manager.
Unlike bees, the evasive maneuver should not go upwards or downwards, nor in a transverse way, but only in two dimensions and only in the direction of the transversality of wheels, i.e. not infinitely and in the way that occurs in the case of bees.
Therefore, in addition to acceleration and dilution, Nissan used a rotting function to avoid collisions, in addition to Nissan's tank.
"This structure has to process and respond to data only a few seconds apart.
There is no need for data storage or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvring, so that it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB memory.
It may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we don't even talk about megabyte-sized memory.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate collision prevention technology that, according to Nissan's estimates, can be involved in mass-produced cars within 10 years.
The robot is operated by lithium-polymer batteries that are easier and more durable than lithium-ion variant.
In the future, further deployment of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an opportunity to bring the car to its end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of the protection from the armour.
We have to admit that the U.S. Mining Department, apart from having a lot of investmentable cash, has no sense at all.
Given the crisis in the neck and the fact that the Americans do not get into the jams of questionable solvency mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel".
This is the "rough credit facility"... that is to say, the Gauls's.
The shape of the accommodation and, in particular, of the reception furniture mill suggests that we should consider again, twice, even more three times, if the time of purchase has actually just come.
And especially where to claim a loan, because that's probably the purpose of the thing.
The information available on the website is really useful, but it is a little detailed.
It's more about kamas than about the general public.
But what would happen if we added to the game?
For example, a room of our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, it's something, because we can't even dream about buying a place...
The Stanley opens the capital of the MuFG for MUFG.
The main Japanese bank is paying USD 9 billion for 21% of the company's capital, after the share price of  Morgan Stanley's shares fell heavily on the stock market.
One week after the contract was published, the two banks said that MUFG buys 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's shares at a price of $25,25 per unit, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price falls below 19% of the value of securities on 31 August.
MUFG invests an additional 6 billion dollars in the purchase of alternatable securities, which provide a 10% return and their exchange rate is 31.25 dollars.
According to the report by Mr. Stanley, the average exchange rate for global transactions is 29 USD, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate at the time of the global transaction.
However, the stock exchange rate for Morgan Stanley decreased by around 6.79% on average from 17:00 to $ 23.07.
"This strategic alliance is a great opportunity for Morgan Stanley to speed up the transformation of banking into a company," explains John Mack, CEO of the United States Group.
Mr. Stanley approved the new status by which he could diversify his activities last week, while under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The MUFG agreement reaffirms that the current financial crisis requires even more caution from the companies registered on Wall Street.
It is clear from the conditions announced on Monday that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan only announced on Monday that it would sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the participation would be made up of all of the shares," explained Toshihidide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG in the Tudor.
"However, because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and avoid potential risks."
On a weighted average basis, MUFG will pay 7 % more than the value of the financial assets of Morgan Stanley than the value of the financial instrument.
As a result of the transaction, the yield per share will decrease by approximately 20%.
Pursuant to the Agreement, MUFG may, in a year’s time, convert its primary shares into shares if the trade rate of the latter exceeds a conversion rate of more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. it rises to about $47.
On this basis, the Standley ensures that it can use the money from MUFG to use its investment potential, to improve its balance sheet and to increase its liquid assets.
However, the group spokesperson did not require accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the association of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its solvency rate according to Tier I by approximately 15%, one of which will be the best in its own sector.
Morgan stated that its conclusion "definitely" improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, a great effort has been made for the group, as the stock exchange fell half the price of its shares, while the cost of providing for non-payment risk has gone to hell.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained high, at around 12%.
Of the large banks, one of them remains after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch. This is the Goldman Sachs, which last week announced that he received $15 billion: part of this came from the Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa Monday's statement, Quito
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint plan for Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Uori.
Following the model of his presidents and his friends, on Sunday Correa explained her views on the new constitution.
The mission was successfully completed as 64% of voters voted in favour of the referendum, according to official findings, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of them were cast in full.
The adoption of the Constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, both the two surveys carried out at the end of the polling offices and the count made by a civil society organisation have proven the enormous importance of 'yes' votes by 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa talked about winning the Constitution of the Night Day from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won an overwhelming victory," he said, and he thanked the Guineans at the Governor's seat in Guayaquil, on the southwest of the West 280.
As is known to be the case, Rafael Correa Chávez, Morales and the President of Chile also congratulated Michelle Bachelet.
According to the report of the United States Monitoring Mission (OAS), the vote took place in a calm atmosphere, the main topic of which was a 444-point text, incorporating the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The Constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, maintaining the right of the state to "development plan" for a country that mainly uses oil production from foreign companies and foreign currency from foreign companies.
The draft Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also confirms the power of the Prime Minister, who may acquire mandates for up to two consecutive periods and who shall be entitled to terminate the country's division.
Correa has already announced that it would take this opportunity and will once again compete for the Prime Minister's mandate in February 2009.
In addition, the Constitution included the freedom of health services and education. The President has already started to introduce it in a country with 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population lives in the minimum population.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could lead to the end of the Otto and Washington Agreement on the use of the Food Plant, which is the basis of the American anti-drug measures.
They released 19 hostages in Chad.
He was hit by a team member from Egypt on kidnappers who had taken 11 tourists and eight escorts of them hostages ten days ago.
The hostages are now in the Kaupa.
11 European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed on Monday afternoon to the capital of Egypt.
The hostages were released during the morning in Chad by an Egyptian commander in Egypt.
In a visibly good condition, an aircraft arrived at the al-Maza military base, which is directly linked to the international airport in Cairo, around 6:30.
The hostages were forbidden to comment to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in the suburbs of Cairo in Maadi, a suburbs of Cairo, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and kidnappers are "no ransom paid" - said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were taken prisoner on September 19 at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were involved in land-based safari. The group was then dragged from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hostages.
In the group, he was 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and a Romanian woman) and eight Egyptians: two tours, four drivers, one explorer and the director of the Agyptian travel agency.
According to the information provided by the Egyptian security officer, a Special Commissioner with 30 members arrived on two helicopters at the scene where they were hit on the hostages just before the current.
"There was a fire fight among the troops, half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled," said the leader who asked for his name to be silenced.
He also noted that a total of 150 special task force members were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Fleet to Sudan, where German and Italian commanders were added.
Mr Franco Frattini, Head of Diplomatic Studies in Belgium, emphasised the role of secret agents and special groups of Italians.
"We must recognise that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our security officers and our action groups," he stated, without further details being communicated.
He denied to pay a ransom for a hostage.
The day before, the Sudanese army announced that during a patrol, a roadwalk on which the kidnappers traveled was arrested, six of them killed (including the leader of the Chad) and two were arrested.
The army claims that the hostages were related to a Dürfur rebel organization, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately dissected by the organization concerned.
Lettres - Most of the quietness of culture"
The debate on the financing of culture is currently at the heart of the press and the current election campaign.
That's all we can be happy for.
But a piece of our cultural life will continue to be forgotten.
Will you raise your voice to discover the ridiculous amounts that are being managed by small museums, archives, archeological digs and national historical monuments at the edge of the famine?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of the cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in both Quebec and Canada that are truly effective in the effect of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
And the Constitution of our American neighbours states that cultural heritage protection is part of American culture, and this heritage should be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all governmental bodies.
Within the framework of the Association of Québec Historical Societys (Fédération des socialétés d'histoire du Quebec), 211 history, cultural heritage, archives and genetics companies are working on research by more than 40,000 volunteers in history, as well as the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological remains, with a minimal budget.
Often, these organizations protect our tooth-circular heritage and protest against the last of the suffocationer when real estate developers and decision-makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeterys.
When is anyone going to stand up for the protection of the historical and cultural heritage?
Participate part of the Fortis bank in the Benelux Governments.
The Benelux States are helping, by means of a single state, the Benelux States, because of the knock-on effect of the U.S. financial crisis - as the first European - on the Belgian bank, on Fortis: the three countries are supporting the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
At the end of the week, the Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government agreed at the highest level, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area, Fortis bank is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of a shocking international financial market crisis for more than a year, and the decisions taken in the area of the bank can therefore in certain ways be considered to be indicative.
According to the decision taken on the Sunday evening, almost half (49 per cent) of the three states will acquire the bank’s existing property there in half (49 per cent) of all the states.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, in particular, the activities purchased from Dutch ABN Ammo last year - mainly insurance - mainly from Dutch ABN Ammo last year.
Fortis's shares started in a steep crash last week, and in the second half of the week, there were already serious crises in the institution.
However, stakeholders agree that the bank's 85,000 employees are too large to let it go bankrupt.
The company's papers fell by about 12 percent on this Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
With regard to the current prices, the Group's total market share is around EUR 14 billion, but according to company managers, this is not realistic.
The company itself was responsible for the overseas market uncertainty with regard to the adoption of the $700 billion US package plan for the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already slightly increased.
On Friday, a new CEO was appointed to the bank's head of the company in the name of Filip Dierckx.
The financial institution was also looking for private financial institutions, but no one has been asked for a substantial offer yet.
The Belgian Government has already indicated before that investors do not have to worry or lose their money.
There has been no panic among bank clients so far, and the branches have not been rushed.
In Hungary, Fortis has its own account and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in a hemp. A fox in a hemp.
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often, based on data on people's drug purchases, refuse to enter into an insurance contract with the customer.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become inseparable.
"There is a data protection scheme that binds the use of pharmacovigilance data to the consent of the person concerned in all cases.
It must be independent, otherwise we trust the fox with the hen," quotes Richard Dicket, the developer of the drug prescription program in Washington Post.
Companies depend on the health status of the customer on the insurance premium and the amount of damages, and if they consider the risk too high, they do not commit insurance.
He was sent for medical examination once and the contract was terminated only in the light of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick has been developing a much cheaper procedure for ten years: he can easily get from the pharmacy based on the customer identification number which medicines he has bought over the past six months, and the program itself concludes what disease he suffers from and what his state of health is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually uncontrollably high, which is a category of high risk.
Several versions of the programme are in circulation, some of them also determine a risk factor, so the insurance company is outside the scope of the paper work, although some difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some medicines may be used for several purposes, such as the use of certain compounds against migraines or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers, not the previous ones.
Special companies have been set up to request and process the data, and before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, they will request the patient's consent.
They are now required by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Companies are now working on the results of laboratory tests and are also connected to pharmaceutical consumption data so that they can provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, while controlling use becomes increasingly difficult.
There is a specific health data protection law, but only applies to healthcare providers and insurance undertakings.
Before the convention there is a legislative proposal that also confers control over undertakings specialising in reporting to the authorities.
Dick is aware that this is not enough: therefore, he has upgraded his programme, which would link the transfer of data to the relevant express contribution.
Another question is that the person concerned may not refuse consent, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract.
So the hens are also referring to the benevolence of the fox.
The Global Martial Menu page
Trade is doubled by the European Union and India.
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda for the 9th Summit was also dominated by the other, largely global, problems.
There will be a French-Indian summit today, where nuclear cooperation will be the main issue.
The European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic power that should be given a greater voice in international matters, but the Member States have not yet managed to reach a common denominator to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the United Nations Council.
This question was thus not raised at the Marseilles last night, and was already at the ninth summit.
Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, French President of the Union, as President-in-Office of the Union, as well as President-in-Office of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Javier Solana, received President Manmohan Singh of India, who agreed to double trade in five years, which would increase trade turnover to about a hundred billion euros.
Given that trade between 2000 and 2007, increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
In this respect, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India were legally consolidated, i.e. air traffic could also flow in the future.
By the end of 2009, India will be able to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Alkosy promised to speed up the negotiation.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU's first trade partner in India is New Delhi, it is only in the ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - the latter was condemned in every way on both sides and urged the UN Conference to be convened.
The completion of the Doha Round has also been called for, although each of them has a large share in the past.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, i.e. it would like to reduce its emissions by at least 20 % by 2020.
India agreed on this, as well as that a global agreement should be reached at the climate conference due to take place next year and the production of greenhouse gases should be reduced by fifty per cent by 2050.
I also want to prevent food prices from rising and to support the international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the capital of France today, where he intends to do business on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at the bilateral meeting.
In the future, they trust that the French companies will receive 20 billion euros of money for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to news from the Agency, the agreement would be for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian booksellers in the United States of America
Italian publishers represent themselves with a strong field at Frankfurt International Accountancy Store.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the most significant international copyright meeting of the 60th Buchmesse Prize.
There are 7 000 exhibitions expected for this year’s Frankfurt International Store in 101 countries, in 171.790 square meters of base area, where more than 403,000 books will be presented. The guest company will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony at the Italian Pavilon, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary-General of the Ministry of Culture and Activities: Italy, through the establishment of a single Italy point, will take 264 square meters of exhibition area.
The grand opening will be followed by a press conference at the "Rom Struktur" of the Buchmesse 5.0 pavilion, where data, trends and prospects on the state of the Italian book issue will also be presented.
According to data, the share of foreign authors in the Italian publishing market is constantly increasing, particularly in the area of adult and youth publications.
They found the plane of a one-year-old billionaire, Steve Fossettt, who was missing a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, which disappeared on 3 September 2007 over the nevada desert.
The wreckages were found on a 3,000-metre high plain, located in Mammoth Lakes, in a mountain of Sierra Nevada, on the borders of California and Nevada.
Human remains were not found inside the plane.
Mr. John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, all of the existing doubts have been eliminated: "After determining the location of the scene, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's about the machine Steve Fossett was on the day of his missing flight," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found either in the aircraft or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transport Safety Agency (NTSB) announced that a committee of inquiry had been requested a few hours after the discovery of the wreck, which was able to identify the machine and to establish that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that happened on 3 September 2007, on the day Fosset took off from Nevada Yerington on a three-hour flight.
Yesterday in California, not far from the Nevada border, a couple found some personal items of Fosset near Mammoth Lakes' home.
Two identification documents under Fosset, issued by the Federal Aviation Surveillance Authority of Illinois, issued some cash and a sweater.
His search was submitted one month after the loss of one month.
The billionaire has set up many peaks through which he has enlisted himself in history.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he was able to fly the ground with a balloon: two weeks of flight.
Three years later, he was on a plane around the ground without landing.
Its record includes the flight over the Andes at a height of 15.445 metres, which it performed with a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising.
An unusual, yet original and firm-worlded hobby jet with large surfaces and clean corners.
This is the latest "compat roadcraft" of Mercedes-Benz, which the German car factory tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
The introduction of SUV GLK in the Mercedes-Benz production halls from 17 October is also surprising and unusual due to this content.
Because the commercial campaign accompanying the arrival of a new vehicle is currently operating with an unknown media communication tool, including by means of utopian 3D posters, which have not yet been used by the car brand in Italy.
The Billboard action, consisting of three stages, will dominate the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como by 15 November.
The first phase of this new media communication begins with the introduction of the road-space, in which it will be visible in almost real and three-dimensional form with the help of the new SUV, the special glasses on Corso Como.
The illustrator will feel as if the car is rising from the poster.
Then, by means of the innovative Lifestyle8 technology, each detail of the new GLK will be seen by each other, so that then it will be made up in a uniform way.
There is no doubt that Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotic world of the automotive industry with this promotion.
Will this raise the interest of future customers?
We will show you who the Italian football leagues are.
They are likely to be excluded from the orbits.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls, for which all of Italy is now ashamed? The members of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been following the public for years, and which, in fact, has not caused too much trouble so far.
I've never been in contact with any of the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-hand.
The chief contractors come from the 30th of the year.
Also in Verona, Padua, Terest and Udine.
They have been joined in Sofia by smaller sloping groups (in fact only a few units) coming from Campania and Puglia in Sofia.
Italian flags were flying, on which the home town of the fans was indicated: on Saturday, these were removed so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of the English cheerleader.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi cheerleading team, the Levski Drunkers.
The Italian football union gave the Italian fans 144 tickets, these were tickets, so it would be easier to check out the fan team.
The Ministry of Home Affairs also checked everyone: there was no such thing as a trial between those who were due in Sofia, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with their football-related grades have been denied the ticket and leave.
Currently, the Ministry of Home Affairs is waiting for minutes from the Sofia police, then taking the necessary measures: the supporters who have been arrested or identified during the riots may also be banned for five years.
It is an international ban on access to all stadiums in Europe, not only in Italy but also in Europe.
So our football leagues can't fit their feet on any football course.
Lucky for you.
However, we must also fear that the hooligans will find followers, i.e. that they will join the fewer than fifty-five, and others will join them.
"At the same time, this fire must be repressed, and no excuse should be given to the person who behaves in this way," said the Ministry of Interior.
So it is better to keep our eyes open, especially since the Wednesday match has been scheduled for Lecse.
In Puglia, there is a smaller cell that supports Italian studies.
The Monitoring Service will meet tomorrow, and on Tuesday, the Security of Sports Events Audit Committee, which may also be part of the Internal Security Service, will meet with covert services in the field of cheerleading.
"Duce-Duce's scan and a sitting arm under the national hymn? In Bulgaria, no crime..."
This idea has been highlighted, rather unfortunately, by Domenico Mazzilli, who has been appointed to the Ministry of the Interior's Monitoring Service a few weeks ago (post from Francesco Tagiente and before that from Felence Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli used to be chief of police in the city where he has been operating since 2002 as a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group.
What Mazzilli claims to be true in Bulgaria is not allowed to live in Duc, but the behaviour of that 150-200 fan was mysterious.
I'm not a socialist, he's the first member of the staff, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime took place.
So far, this group is not a problem, but we need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to continue.
But let's talk a little more about the whirlwind of the Italian hymn: it's no crime, but, if I may say so, it's not a good thing to call it a promotion..."
