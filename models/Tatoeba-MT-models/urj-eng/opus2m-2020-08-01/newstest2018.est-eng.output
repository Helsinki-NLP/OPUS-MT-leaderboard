Four members of the Kemerovo Group were arrested in Estonia and Spain.
According to the postman, the police in Spain arrested Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo Group operating in the underworld of Estonia, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, arrested in Spain, was arrested under the authority of a court of law.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects in Estonia.
It is suspected that the so-called Kemerovo criminal community members aged between 27 and 57 years are the main perpetrators of criminal offences.
In the Spanish Malaga province of Mijas, the alleged leader of the criminal community was arrested in the Spanish province of Malaga.
Three men were suspected in Estonia, one of whom, according to the data collected, is the lead figure of the criminal community and two are members of the criminal community.
The data collected suggest that there were clearly shared tasks and roles in the criminal community.
The purpose of the criminal community’s action was to commit criminal offences and thereby to earn revenue,” commented the President of the Criminal Court’s case-law, Public Prosecutor Vaur Verte.
"We do not rule out the presence of suspects in this criminal case," added the prosecutor.
These are people who have also been involved in law enforcement in the past, and some of them have been punished for criminal offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become commonplace for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," commented Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Criminal Police Service, said that detentions were preceded by an indictment that lasted nearly a year and a half.
"In the first half of the month, long-term work was realised and we held the suspects of crimes in Estonia and Spain at the same time," he said.
He found that police officers in Spain were helping with detention in Spain.
For years now, we have good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian military.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can get them from another part of Europe," said Leis.
The information collected so far suggests unanimously that in the absence of freedom, suspected men may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the D.A. requested their arrest and the Court of Justice also approved it.
The man who has been arrested in Spain is awaiting his surrender to Estonia.
In this case, real estate, vehicles and cash are seized to ensure confiscation.
The pre-crime procedure for criminal matters shall be conducted by the Office for the misdemeanour of the CCP and shall be conducted by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
In 2005, the City Court of Tallinn condemned Slava Gulevich and sentenced him to five years in jail.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered to be the second most important man in Estonia's criminal world following the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he began to deal with blackmails in Tallinn.
He claimed to have taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes operating at different hotels and charged monthly roof charges to businessmen.
The international joint operations, the confiscation of proceeds from crime and the decisions that have entered into force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the so-called "Dikayev criminal offenders" of the so-called "Dikayev" criminal case, who were confiscated for EUR 80 000, or the judgment on a third party in the fact that Igor Aleynikov created a criminal community in 2006 aimed at the illicit trafficking of cigarettes and the committing of crimes involving trafficking in human beings in East-Viru and South-Estonia.
The amount of revenue that has been confiscated there is close to EUR 71 500.
In these criminal cases, progress has been made by the daily exchange of information and evidence by police officers with foreign colleges and prosecutors and, if necessary, by cooperation in any country of the European Union.
The Civil Society Organisation warns against travelling to Missouri.
The Organization's Organization for the Advance of the Colored People (NACP) has warned about state-of-the-art politics and racist attacks against black people travelling to Missouri.
The Group's statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, invites all African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to be particularly careful and careful when moving around the state, taking into account the entire race of suspicious racial-based events that have recently been identified throughout and also here throughout the state."
According to the NACC, the group was encouraged to issue travel warnings both in the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to overcome discrimination cases, and also in the fact that the targets for state law enforcement officers are, to a large extent, relatively minority.
"The civil rights of the people are being violated.
They are drawn along the road because of their skin, beaten or killed," said Rod Chapel, President of the branch of NAAH Missouri, to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never had so much complaints before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organisation for the United States of America.
The group referred to events such as the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sands, from Missouri University and Tennessee, black Tory Sands, from black students in black.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas driving through the state, and Missouri police arrested him without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that in the state, vehicles of black drivers are being stopped by 75% more likely than those of white drivers in the state.
"The point is that people should be aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people must be prepared, as is the taking of bail money or informing relatives that they are passing through the state."
On the basis of the latest data in the hate crime notification programme, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missurin in 2015, which places the state in a cross-section 16 of the state in a number of cases.
The alert is also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in the search for home or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued a travel note on travel to and from Arizona following the adoption by those States of immigration laws which obliged the local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations because ACTU stated that this increases racial profiling.
Normally, the Foreign Ministry is issuing travel warnings for other countries, but recent stakeholders are beginning to use this measure in response to certain U.S. laws and trends.
Hepatitis: What could anyone know about the different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which may develop into hepatic cirrhosis, i.e. liver wrinkles and liver cancer, is of a haematopoietic nature.
Hallo Kutsar, an epidemiologist of the Agency, tells us that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of hepatitis - fever, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of skin and mucosal tissues.
The latter disease also results from a popular name for hepatitis of the liver.
In children, hepatitis can pass without symptoms.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined on the basis of laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can be converted into chronic hepatitis and run for decades without symptoms, which means that man may not know anything about his dangerous liver-damaging disease.
The hearing Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in more detail.
The hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us with contaminated food or drinking water, sex, infected human stools into hands and hands to food, soils, objects, mouth contact, and drug use.
The risk, or risk group, of hepatitis A infection includes the family and carers of the sick, people with chronic liver disease, people who have sex with the infected, men who have sex with men, drug users, travelers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
Infectiousness can be prevented in vaccinations, in particular vaccination is recommended for a large number of travelers and for persons at risk for hepatitis A.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before being used for food.
Hepatitis B viruses are common with the exposure of sick people to blood, injection of drugs, tattooing, occulting, blood-infected social agents (tummy brushes, shaves), donor blood, sex with a hepatitis suspect, and hepatitis from a mother to a foetus/reception child.
The risk group for hepatitis B infection includes injecting drug users, infected people's sex partners, men who have sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health, rescue and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high hepatitis B disease.
In order to prevent hepatitis B it is possible to vaccinate people; in particular, it is recommended that vaccination should be given to persons at risk and to persons with chronic liver disease, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
The other preventive measures for hepatitis B are: to avoid the use, tattooing and delivery of alien hygiene and manicure equipment, other tools and injection needles, and to avoid the use of condoms in the event of harmful sex or sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national vaccination plan and free of charge for children in Estonia.
Hepatitis C viruses occur in contact with the blood of a sick person, in the case of drug injection, tattooing, exfoliation, blood-created lifetimes, donor blood, sex with a hepatitis suspect, and hepatitis disease from the mother to the foetus/infant.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, infected people's sex partners, men who have sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, family members and carers, health, rescue workers and policemen exposed to blood and other body fluids, persons with HIV infection and passengers visiting countries with high levels of disease C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: to avoid the use, tattooing and delivery of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other tools and injection needles, and use of condoms in case of dangerous sex.
C vaccine against hepatitis is not a vaccine.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus that is derived in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Therefore, hepatitis D infection is present with hepatitis B or with chronic hepatitis B patients who have an infection with hepatitis B or who have a hepatitis B disease which is a common infection.
D hepatitis D viruses are spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, with their contaminated injection needles, sexually and rarely infected mother to the foetus.
D The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus strains and people who do not have immunity to hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against hepatitis D virus infection.
E-hepatitis viruses spread on an oral basis with water and food, including infrequently cooked meat, fish and shellfish, donor blood, shared syringes and infected mother to the foetus.
Keepers may become infected with E in countries with high levels of disease.
The prevention measures for this hepatitis are hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after taking a toilet, before cooking and eating, after taking care of the sick.
Fruit and vegetables wash before consumption, avoid eating low-cooked meat, fish and seaweeds, drink only safe drinking water and avoid consumption of drugs.
Although in the last round, the competitors tried to push a double Olympic winner off the road, Farah, a 34-year-old, found strength at the end and won in time of 26..4.,51.
Farah did not think long, pulling along with his wife Tania and children after the finish.
This was a special moment for me.
I miss my family very much.
Being on the ground with them was wonderful," Farah said to the journalist.
In London, Farah targets the golden doubles of the fifth title competition between 5,000 and 10,000 meters.
Everything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Dam in gold." Gustav Klimti's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Barer's special story" is a far deeper story than the birth of one of the works of art in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries of Vienna's cultural life.
Even further on the history of time.
An awesome amount of information would have been useful, perhaps in a tougher cut-edge, a tighter topic that was allowed to be used in the title, to have more effect on the exceptional story.
The story of Adele Bloch-Bauer in the picture of Gustav Klimti and his painting of "Daam Gold" and the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer, and a much more extensive and universal-looking history of the appreciated Jewish family and the German occupation, together with its consequences, is in the light of the present case.
The first third takes the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of a pulsating region and who himself has been in the capital of Austria, you can only imagine how more than a hundred years ago life in the Ringstras area came or how everyone turned their head in the Central Cafe when Klimt stepped in.
The concentration of artists was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and when you see a name known in the book, you feel like a gram closer culture.
For example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was operating in a city where the incessant guilt and the highest level of suicide in Europe is a city where nothing gives rise to the development of the story.
Or, or so - any hypothetical jacket adds colors to the culture of the early 20th century in Vienna.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union from a trip to the Soviet Union.
In the last few decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had grown explosively, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the century, almost every ten inhabitants of Vienna had Jews.
Kadele's parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married her twice older Czech sugar magnate with Ferdinand Bloch and posted to Klimt for her famous paintings, her father had already become the biggest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet did not pull the whole glamorous life he belonged to.
When you look at "Dam gold," it's hard to believe that, towards the end of life, this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order a portrait from Klimt from his wife, Ferdinand Bloch was the hottest painter in Vienna at the last moment.
At that time, Klimti's order cost 4000 SEK, a quarter of the price of a good place in the farm.
The fact that some portraits suspected of having a master's love story with a model did not discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist in the course of the work continued for the rest of its life.
Anne-Marilie O'Connor - "Dam baby.
Gustav Klimti master's, Adele Bloch-Barer's portrait of a special story", Varrak 2016, translated by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work started with Adele, Klimt was in Ravennas San Vitale's bass, and the researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics of the Empress Theodoras, which were seen there, gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adeles as a painted mosaig.
Klimt presented his "Dam gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at the same time (in 1907-1908) another golden land was born in "Sullus".
Artistic historians did not notice the likeness of two women.
What does the story have to do with Hitler?
"I think that in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him money to make his work available to the public", Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the Director of the Invedere Museum and wished their family Klimt Assembly to go to the museum.
Six years before the death of Klim, Adeles had been preparing for another edition on Klim.
Also in his will (Ale left in February 1925), he asked his spouse to leave his two portraits and four Gustav Klimt landscapes in the country.
He gave his bridesmaids to Mary and Luis, his niece.
A year after Klimt had completed "Asteria Mona Lisa", he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but he failed to get through the drawing process.
Sometimes Hitler’s later anti-emeticism is considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him to the Academy, but none of his investigators really were Jewish.
In particular, the task of the Austrian authorities referred to in the Mary Testament had changed greatly by 1939 - it had become important to find works for Nazi parties in the rich Jewish art works of Vienna.
Some of Adele's work at home, but not Klimt's, were also suitable for a personal artefact.
Six months after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year trial began between the Austrian Government and the heirs of Bloch-Bauer.
In this regard, it is only noted that if the "Spiration" sees Ale Bloch-Barer in the castle of Belvedere in Vienna, the "Dadam Gold" is to be seen in the New York Neue Gallery.
And before you go to Vienna to read the above-mentioned book before you go to Vienna.
Even if you don't plan on going to Klimt's job, because at least my movements turned around after closing the book more Nazi and Jewish than the painting sold for 135 million dollars and the model Adele Bloch-Bauer re-elected.
So it's not as hard as the family's fate story, and it's a very seductive story.
Noteably, the beginning of the book made it easier for an event to focus on the family of the Leids.
The 17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada to the 17-year-old.
In the dream, Gold himself was 200 m swimming very close to his last record of swimming in the back of his own 200 m, swimming very close to 2.16, 62.
The tip mark dates back to 17 years after the Canadian Junior Championships took place on 2.16,58, the Priit Aakku will mediate the Swim Society.
The edges will be the last one, the 10th A-final.
In the finals, he went through a dance with a time of 2.15,76 and won a good spot with a new powerful cape.
Of the record of Estonia (2.15, 13) belonging to Alina Kendzior, Gold remained separated for a little more than half a second.
Estonia's record of all time rose to the third, and its fresh tip is the fifth result of all time.
Youth's future is still on the way to the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m free-crowding and 200 m and 400 m complex swimming.
Last week at the Canadian Junior Championships held in Toronto, Canada, and Gold made a successful start there too.
He won 200 m in a free-drinking night with a time of 2.03, 22.
It was so quickly floated from the distance of the last half of 2008 for the last time.
More than ever since, in Estonia, only Elina Parkõka, the Estonian recordsman, has been swimming this distance.
Another 100 m free-crowded Estonians in Canada won the bronze medal with an excellent record and a new top mark of the Estonian season 56th of June.
For example, this year's older Kertu Ly Alnek has lost this dance only a century later.
He was able to reach the personal peak of 100 m more when he was able to swim in the opening of the call for a letter on the 1st of March, the first of October, the second of October, the second of October, the second of October, the second of October, the second of October, the second of October, the second of October, the second of July, the second of July, the second of July, the second of July, the second of July, the second of July, the second of July, the second of July, the second of July,
At half the distance, he only reached the second place when he was swimming in the finals of the finals of the 2nd, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th, 7th
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season data in four different distances.
The President Trump goes on vacation, critics re-installing the greenhouse gases.
The time of vacation is now - that is, it also means relaxing for the President of the United States of America, Donald Somp.
However, as Trump has so far been one of the presidents who had taken the most out of the holidays, critics are changing for months.
According to the United States Today and the CNN, the president is planning a 17-day holiday to be held at a private club in Bedminster, New Jersey, in his own name.
Although the President's holiday began yesterday, the Trump opponents on the holiday have already taken the floor for the weekend.
They're giving Trump too much time to rest.
In fact, the president has a habit of spending weekends in his own homes of Florida, Virginia and New Zealand.
By the way, Trump has not been the most retired President in his 196th day.
For example, George W. Bush had to spend 67 days on vacation in this time, Barack Obama half less than Trump, only 21 days.
But at Trump, things tend to get a little out of control.
Counted days after becoming president, Trump said in "60 minutes" that there will be no time for a long rest during his midwife, because very much needs to be done.
He also expressed his disagreement three years ago about Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is cutting off the press heads".
According to the White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
It is officially called a job leave, during which there is no time for reading the Fairer or any other form of entertainment.
In addition, there must have been another reason for the leave of employment.
Namely, in the White House, the air conditioning system will be replaced and the entire staff will have to leave the facility.
Ovalaabine and other presidential offices are also located in the front of the village.
"I don't think anyone else would like to be on the air in August, if there's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioner," said the White House's spokesperson, Lindsay , who stressed that the President would continue to work during his stay.
When President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Copying critics from Facebook do not apply to the public office unless you tolerate the criticism of voters.
Our country's father knew about the poor media coverage anyway.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long in the paper to get rid of him from everything from domestic politics to political principles.
Of course, he was irritated by criticism.
But he did not force his critics to remain silent.
In 1783 Washington said that "the freedom of expression may be taken away from us, and darker and quieter and quieter, we may be led to the slaughter of sheep in a way that may lead us to slaughter."
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland, who has to work hard to be more Washington-like.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and erased at least 450 people's posts, who published their opinions on his official Facebook page.
From this end of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union (US Civil Liberties Union) brought him to justice for this matter.
The governor's staff considered the action to be empty and web comments were all over the counter-reactions in the style "Who cares?".
"It's only Facebook," said many people.
But it matters.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is, in fact, a popular Republican governor in the most popular state in the United States of America.
His discharge is well above the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a thoughtlessly responsive funk.
He has led the state with a firm hand and remained firm about his principles.
In addition, he has been using Facebook as the main tool in communicating with his constituents, for example, by presenting his bald head for the first time after chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's newspaper, which is a public forum officially marked, managed by the blocking of visitors who receive taxpayers' dollars from the dollar, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's press representative Amelia Chasse defended the interview given to The Washington Post about the behaviour of the governor, claiming that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.
It is too easy to paint a picture of the web-sliding internet trolls, spam mailer, or full of hate.
The Post talked to a number of real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's what they really are, people who communicate with their elected leaders, teachers, company owner and pastor, not internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thought-out, and not gross.
In his journal, the pastor quoted the Bible, pressing Hogan’s cataclysm into the Bible.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ráani, from the Maryland Bowie, did not provoke hatred, but rather real hate crimes.
"I politely told him that I was disappointed because he has not reacted to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in The Post's news story in the comment state.
"I also do not like the idea that, as many people comment on the same subject, someone immediately calls it an implicit collective effort, rather than admitting that this is a great deal of concern for citizens."
What the governor's staff called "the targeted spam attack" would be called "the open support" by others.
The Facebook Age allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking the critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's a lot cleaner than it used to be when the same thing had to be done to send out workers to collect and burn the newspaper with critical instructions, or arrest the protestors and make them remain silent.
That's exactly what's happening right now, just learnt.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for taking down Facebook and other social media channels.
The President has been sued by the users of Twitter who have been blocked out of his Twitter stream.
One of the first judgments with a marked significance on this matter was taken last week in Virginia.
In Alexandria, district judge James C. Cacheris decided that the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County broke the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter on his Facebook page.
Kentuckys also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for the use of ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, postal costs had a similar effect to those of the Internet during Washington.
Between 1776 and 1800 plenary sessions, the number of newspapers and anonymous writers embroidered his way of management.
And even then, Washington had to stick his ass with anonymous trolls.
Papers were written in newspapers under pseudonyms such as Yuriola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making D.C. decisions.
In accordance with the historical documents collected in the framework of the Web-based George Washington Letter Collection Project, he buried his office under petitions which criticised his views on the partnership, trade and association agreements with the United Kingdom.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of expression, differences of opinion and debates are the start of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty expects the comfort of his home in Renaissance Square.
The previous number of European premiere Ronan Rafferty will look forward to home comfort within the next three days if the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf courses of East Lothian Renaissance Poker.
A northerner, who was leading the last round ahead of the last round of the Archerfield Links routes in the previous year before Paul Nevere's surrender, has become attached to the new venue and is fulfilling the role of the president and founder of the club, instead of the founder and CEO of the village.
"See how Renaissance Club was built, and now we see how the club with this event shines in full glory," Rafferty said.
"The players see the track in its best shape, it's in a glorious state.
They have done a great job in creating this place.
He is a zealous supporter of the golf game and is proud of what has been achieved here.
This allows the track to be presented in an excellent manner."
An Englishman Everes looks forward to being able to defend the nobility for the first time, even though a man has won a prize in his 32-year-old career in both the Junior Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"It sends a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremamatura Open title because it was taken off my winning competition flight a year later.
It's magical to come back into this area.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we would always carry in our hearts."
Gary Orr will also return to the contest on the inland side of Gary Orr, who joined the senior European tour to the beginning of the year when he received 50.
It is his first event in Scotland after his participation in 2013 in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
"The place to play is always a little more meaningful," said Helensburgh man Orr.
"You want to be good, but you can also feel an extra bench.
I have replayed a great deal of pleasure and quite a real golf game.
I am pleased with the way things are doing."
The Trio will join in the field the winner of the former Masters Prize, Ian Woosnam, and the champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance are two of the six Scottishs at the competition, the rest of which are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Access is free of charge, and parking a car costs 5 pounds for a single passenger car and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and death in Indonesia with grandeur in the land of the land of Indonesia
When Cardinal Degei prepares dinner, he doesn't use a stove.
He even rarely uses pottery.
In a wooden cabin in Enarotoli, the capital of the panic region of Papua Province, in the district of Papua, in the capital of the district of Panama, the hostess is placed directly at the fire station by the housekeeper in local language.
In half an hour, the coaled bubble will be taken from the fire and punctured with unstomached hands with a keen skin.
Degei is sitting on a dirt floor with no furniture, and he also does his daily household chores, for example, washing the laundry with cloudy water from a nearby area.
The role of the toilet is filled by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of four women in his wife, he is not destined to take care of any farm.
Polygamia is right here.
However, working late may be dangerous for most of the men of the village who are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are still wars here.
"No one would dare to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
This is a rare insight into life in Papua Mountains. It is the former Dutch colony, which was joined to Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, during which only 1026 old Okucants were forced to vote under the eyes of their troops.
The movement that stimulated the release of the Dutch people's sovereignty was quick to turn their rage against the Jakarta Government, which still maintains its strong control over the region by keeping foreign journalists and human rights guards out of control.
The country was officially divided into Papua and West Papua in 2003 so that the independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
In order to arrive, you have to fly a province from the capital of Yayapura to Nabire for 90 minutes and then pass the five-hour journey to make you feel sick by a rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19 000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tars and covered by wafer iron roofs that have been turned by the rust into yellow browns in different shades.
Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, not to mention journalists, and almost no foreign country has ever visited here.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Popes of Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
Other changes also took place.
"We're not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, referring to our hand-painted turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"before we carried it on the body, we only carried the leaves of plants."
The Pope is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and statistics on infant mortality and illiteracy are one of the worst in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia's gold-rich land.
Just 100 km from Pania, a mountainous region of about the size of New Jersey, with 153,000 inhabitants, is the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine in Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion in gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be proud of consumer timber stocks, which are estimated to be USD 78 billion.
However, these treasures are the source of the Papak suffering because they result in the smothering presence of the mighty Indonesian army.
The study in The New York Times of 2005 showed that Freeport paid local military and federal units around USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 to a single officer.
The Pope's efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this gold and be treated with mercy.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 Popes have been killed since 196 and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
According to the RAC, in the 1970s there was a mass killing of genocide in the mountainous areas of the Papua tribes in the 1970s.
Last year alone, over 3,300 peaceful protesters arrested the Indonesian police in the area of police.
The 2016 report on "We're all losing" by the Bersbane archbishop contains evidence of cruelty committed in the previous year, such as out-of-court executions, torture (a second report indicates that rape and acts of force are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful protests.
"It is difficult to count the number of officers, because such incidents take place every year," says Andreas Harsono, research researcher at Human Rights Watch in Indonesia.
Screws are still tighter, because the resources of the Papua have caused the influx of reinhabitants from abroad from Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants are Christians, but demographic change is changing, as economic migrants from the Indonesian population from Jaava, Kalimanta, Sumatra and Sulawes come from Muslim economies.
Jaava family dinners sell shrimp and gado-gado with mixed vegetables, which are served together with peanut sauce.
They can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than local popes on the traditional market," explains Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to the capital of the province of Jayapura, Spain, for his work.
"Papus Papupa Mama's [Women] are therefore losing their market share."
The Indonesian President, Mr. Joko Widodo, who is known among the people as Jokowi, promised to deal with these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won his way to the President's Palace in Jakarta from 29 out of 27 out of the 27 districts of Papua, including Panama.
Very little has changed in the suburbs and the locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted in favour of Jokow in the hope that he will fulfill our hopes for the restoration of justice," you says.
In fact, Pania was struggling only two months after Jokowi took part in October in a low state.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotus sang at the fire for Christmas songs when two Indonesian camps appeared on a motorcycle in the darkness.
Desperate children told them to turn on the front lights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, the capacity of one of the soldiers to their vote and later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses say that drunk girls were chasing children and beating them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children among them.
One child, a 16-year-old Yumio, was beaten so brutally that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the close-up election committee was set on fire, and the next day, things continued to escalate.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered in a fair request for a meeting of the local police department and the military command centre in front of the football court and at the local police station.
They carried ceremonial yachts and presented a waita-dance of the Papupa honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and were copied into a bird song.
Some protestors began to cast stones on police and military forces.
In the face of a serious aggravation, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio. "If the crowd is more than three times the resistance, shoot them," said the official document, as seen in the magazine TIME, but which has not been published to the local media.
In the former town of Kego Koto, a senior in Yerememia, Kayme (56) felt threatened and called for peace to be maintained, asking the people to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left arm," he said to the magazine TIME on the porch of the wooden house in his bright colors.
Kayme still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled fires.
"There was a lot of money, a lot of shots," he adds.
The home man Alfius Youw got a cousin looking at him three times, saying three times.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure he was involved," said to the press, “We thought it would be Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, would use only one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
Pope's Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told the reporters that he was only under his command for the security of his station because it was attacked.
"We must protect ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulstiyo of the Papua Police Representative in 2015.
"that's the question of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five other protesters were killed and many injured.
About the killings, it was only the next day that Jakarta arrived in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Yayapuras gave a passionate speech, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the arbitration in Papua.
"I want to solve this case now that it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism for the resolution of human rights crimes.
Almost immediately the excuses followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the '90s and in the early 2000s.
The point is that we have dedicated ourselves to solving these crimes, but we have to follow certain processes," he said.
On 5 June, in Jakartas magazine Wiranto took back his words, saying that he has no intention of creating a mechanism in Papua to deal with complaints.
Instead, he said, "All will be settled by the law."
Wiranto, accused by the UN of human rights crimes involving the death of more than 1,000 people in East Timor in the blood of the 1999 Independence Reform, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including in Pania.
The families of the victims of Panama accepted such claims with darkness of speech.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he's still scared.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that the people of Panama are afraid to crack this incident.
He said he got hit in the mouth after he helped bury the four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot foreign residents at the Panic Neighbourhood in Deiya.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, as a link between the villagers and the manager of the building who refused to send the unconscious man to the hospital.
The male, 24-year-old Ravinus Douw, who drowned fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Innocent villagers protested on a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the word, the villagers created police officers with stones that the latter responded to the alerts.
According to locals, a mobile Brigade (Indonese Army Police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge," said TIME 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw injured persons report.
"I've been hiding myself for two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the relevant police officers and the withdrawal of the police mobile Brigade from the area.
The Government of Indonesia has always been a problem for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of thought-in development feeds on the dissatisfaction of honey, many, Dan and Damal tribes living in the sublime central mountainland of Papua.
Many of them have joined the VPL with the rebels' army, which defends the rights of the popes, by organising, as a matter of course, attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the VPL leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Ídas Kogoya.
In response to this, the army has, under the pretext of the 'Protection of the Sovereignty of the State', arrested Pania over the past few years and held thousands of people in custody.
Some of them will never show up again.
Paniad is known as "the tragicly forgotten place" among the Papua people.
Poverty feeds dissatisfaction.
The little rice that Enarotalis sells is too expensive for locals to buy.
The bread is the same as it is not available.
The whole food is grown mainly by the bata, a little fruit and leaf vegetables.
Absorbing is a work of women, each of whom is able to maintain four or five batate farms.
They usually keep most of their income to the family, the rest sell on the local market.
Ten batats pay only 10 000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over the course of this period, there has been a growing imbalance between the inwards of the Popes and new migrants, which have arrived quite recently since the opening of the new routes at Nabire airport.
The few jobs available will be better educated and more prosperous migrants.
The Popes themselves often lack the resources or the skills needed to run a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there are no jobs and no money here," says John Gobai, President of the Council of Panian tribes.
The isolation keeps the world's face away from the Pope.
In addition to external media, strict restrictions remain on foreign media.
At the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basle Longchamp were sent out of the Pope because "they did not follow the appropriate practices", although they had been granted a rare authorisation for filming.
According to Phelim Kine, Vice-President of the Department of Human Rights Watch, there are no promises made by Jokow regarding the abolition of the restrictions on reporting for transparency and development in order to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to report to Papua's most remote restless countries and West Papua, in the United States of America, are threatening new threats to the rejection of the visa and to the blacklist," he said.
The absence of a turning point in the press means that the pressure on the Government of Indonesia is very much limited to the close neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States in Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands encouraged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "diversity of crime" in Papua, including the shooting of Pania.
These same countries have also historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, rejected group charges, said Jakarta to the journalist: "In Indonesia, there is still democratic order and freedom of the press, so that the evidence of human rights cases is hard to hide."
People around the world want more foreign governments to be noticed.
When the Dutch official delegation was in the front with the national human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar on 4 May at Jayapurat, the local people cut off the letter of their silence, which wanted to remain anonymous, asking for "We want freedom."
The new presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the Popes do not believe that they will vote in favour of Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the shooting of Pania," says Hobai, Chairman of the Council of Nations.
He wants to give Jokow an understanding that, in addition to the fact that people in Panama are constantly living under the threat of a violent army, they are struggling with the misery of their violent educational and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Panama, like the other popes, consider their voice to be a debt to Jokow, which he must repay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the shooting victims in Pania were able to cope with the last symbolic counterattack they buried a body in a country that was opposed to the police department and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on foot, they will not at least let the defendants forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with a head cut off.
"What else can we do?"
There was a fire in the mouth that swallowed the high blower of Torchi Torchi for the second time under me.
On Friday, the fire struck one of the world’s greatest residential towers in the city, forcing hundreds of people to escape from this building at a height of 337 meters and from a 79-story building.
It's another fire that's been destroyed in just two years by the high price that's been called the Torchik, the Torchik Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up on a fire alarm and yelling at people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down the 50th floor," said a resident who called himself George to Reuter.
According to civilian law enforcement officials, the firefighters erased the flame at about 4 a.m. in the local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said that they were working for the victims to secure shelter.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used in the outer surface of high-religious materials worldwide.
In the investigation conducted following the fire in 2015 by the president of Tech, it was found that the most damage was caused by the decoupling panels and isolation on the outer surface.
The police have said that they believe that the isolation of the London Grenfell Tower and the façade panels could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire that took place in June, which killed some 80 people.
Look: These phones are probably going to be sold out in the fall.
Spring and autumn are sweet times for tech fans, because then telephone manufacturers will look at their new top models.
In the spring, the store will be sold to the company, the Huaei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, and new hit-phones will also be expected for the shops in the autumn.
According to Kristjan Seema, Telli's Marketing and Sales Director, this year's flagship is characterised by an innovative design, an eye-scanner, a screen and a ultra-fast processor with Resolution 4K on the edge.
In the world of technology, the company was very excited, which has also reached the front of the sales table for Estonian smartphones.
In autumn, the smart people will be allowed even more immediate express loading, a durable battery, a high-quality camera and a higher security of water and dust.
He added that rumors already allow assumptions to be made and predict four top models that are likely to conquer sales figures this summer.
These four high-end smart phones will reach the shops in autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should be in the middle of September for poets.
You hear, however, what a new Apple model looks like and what can be done by this is spreading a lot.
If iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences next to iPhone 6s, it is expected that the new model will be completely different from the previous one on the 10th birthday of Apple.
Four colors have been spoken of: black, white, pink gold and kroo.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone's front panel, lost the home button and the tracker is built in the screen.
Apple designer Jonyve insists that a new iPhone model looks like a smooth glass.
There has also been a discussion about the chemical version of iPhone.
In addition to the visual scanner, wireless charging and a higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
Sure, it's one year's expected smartphones.
The pre-ordering of the U.S. New Model Galaxy Note 8 will begin on 23 August.
There's been a lot of famous news leaking about what the new "Que Note 8" looks like.
It is said that even more is intended for business, and S Pen provides even more functionality.
There should be two cameras on the phone, one of which is wide and the other is a teleobic object with a narrower field of view.
No one knows what the two rear cameras are capable of yet, but in any case, this is the first test that is certainly comparable to iPhone 8.
However, we look forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has brought three smart phones this year at the top of Nokia 6, their flagship - Nokia 8 is still missing, which will be presented on 16 August.
We look forward to the screen and the ultra-faster Qualcomm Snapdagon 835 processors and a reliable battery, which is a 5-inch edge to the edge of Nokia.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of aluminium housing and significant water and dust resistance class IP68.
Like Yuga, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's solid flagship has so far been XZby, the manufacturer has confirmed that there will be at least two smart phones attached in the near future with even more innovative functions.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
With regard to the new model Sony, it has been speculated that its screen is at least recent.
As the reality arises, we can see very soon, since, in particular, Sony has published his autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place from 1 to 6 September this year.
According to the reports of the leaked telephone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The D.A. Post disclosed the telephone calls between President Donald Trump of the United States of America and the heads of state of Mexico and the United States of America.
On 27 January, Trump made a phone call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, to close the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States broke a wall with him for a public execution, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump set up his presidential campaign's promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and pledged to pay for this project in Mexico.
Transcripts of his first speech were also published with the Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull, who are experiencing a intense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America take refugees to Australia is "surrendering", "insolent", "indistinct" and "indistinct". He claimed that the agreement that was made during Obama's government would leave him impression of the "much" because he has proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States of America.
Trump concluded by informing Turnbull that "it was the day's most unpleasant speech".
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint lodged by the City of Tartu in the case in which the City of Tartu rejected their offer for the purchase of a bus service between July 2019 and 2029.
It is a question of whether or not to reject the OÜ MRP Linid bid for the public procurement of Tartu because the tender did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Aurkin, President of the Ministry of Justice of the United States of Estonia.
This is the period from 01.07. to 30.06.
MRP City Lines appealed to the Supreme Court for a judgment in the District Court of Tartu.
The Supreme Court did not take any action on this matter.
Although many people in social media complain that the noise coming from the Weekly Festival upsets their night and that the whole city is full of drunk festivities, there are many who have no bad words about a festival that lasts on the beach.
I am even very surprised that the parties at the store were so polite.
I didn't see any vagueness or rudeness.
"I've seen your father-in-law", says Laine.
"It's nice to come, to be and to enjoy Pärnu, which is like the winter winter," she adds with joy.
The covetous laine dream that comes from the beach does not bother.
While he still heard music playing on the beach while living in the city center, music has not reached his home food yet.
"But I hope I can hear you," he says with good grace.
Agnes, who talked with the evening newspaper, says that the grand festival is rather good for Pärnu - it will help to make a good contribution to the business of local merchants.
In addition, he is pleased that the summer capital has come to visit so many countryers.
Party noise doesn't bother a woman.
Although I'm no longer on the beach, I'm glad the beach's been alive.
And I'm glad people are moving and it's been like this three times already," says the woman.
The first time, it was a little worse than the first time.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he meditates on.
However, the noise on the beach is common to the summer mayors as he said.
"This Weekly is a very good promo for our small town," says the harlot in the park.
Noise and noise haven't threw his life in the balance either.
What's going on?
We should all stick together.
Think of how it would be better to communicate between nations.
A loud voice man is not to be crushed.
It doesn't bother me, although I live nearby.
"Good people can save themselves and have no trouble", he says.
The guests who have come to Pärnu are polite to his words.
"With the bottles, of course, they've exaggerated a bit, but young people are young and Lord God - let go, but be people and do it!" he says.
Coastal residents have traveled far away by this time, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive effect on life - people like that noise," says Tiina, who walked with her child in Pärnu.
Even though last year it was even further than last year's intervention, his family's sleep in the festival does not mind the music of the festival.
Last summer there was a stage on the other hand, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, and we actually come all the way to Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and reduces the dividends to re-survive business.
British education company Pearson said on Friday that it will cut 3,000 more jobs and reduce its intermediate figures by 72 percent, thereby launching another restructuring programme to overcome the commercial distress.
Disposable jobs, which according to the CEO John Fallon, are highly likely to be concentrated at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, will be transferred to 4000 jobs lost during the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced in May that a further 300 million pounds (USD 394 million) of expenditure under the third cost allocation programme was to be cut in order to try to re-energise a business that has been hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company which agreed to sell last month's shares in the Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations regarding the year have not changed since the announcement of revenue from a 1 % increase of GBP 2,05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convulsions in Kabul: a suicide attack on NATO was killed in NATO.
A suicide bomber was attacked by military officers in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, by an officer who killed one of the NATO soldiers and one of you wounded.
NATO's statement said that five wars and interpreters were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that Afghanistan has caught this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in the Herat Moscheerüre.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO's statement said that on Thursday evening an explosion occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with "the human being carried himself with a prepared explosive".
The application claims that everything is injured in a stable state and is treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to the Correspondents, the United Nations and the group known as the so-called “ISIS” are an ever-growing source of concern for the forces in Qarabaghi, NATO Bagramis.
According to the UN, 1662 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, some 20% of them in the capital city.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul mainly shot at at least 30 people in the guerrilla region.
They claimed they were under attack.
On May 31, a major bombing in the downtown of the city killed more than 150 people - it has led to the most deaths of a military attack in the country since the forces led by the United States were defeated in 2001 by the Taliban.
This violence promotes the uncertain security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of U.S. forces helping the military and the police.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have contributed to public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghan.
The EPPA annulled the decision to postpone the suss Regulation following the action for appeals.
The United States of America Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) withdrew the decision to take action against the introduction of the Obama-Time Regulation which obliges States to limit emissions that cause mistletoe, one day after the 15 States appealed to the Agency as a result of this action.
The EPA announced the decision to continue with the "Ozone Determination Activities in 2015" late on Wednesday, saying that this indicates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe that we need to hold a dialogue and listen to them from our state partners," said EPA President Scott Pruitt in his statement.
Pruitt had announced in June that EPA’s intention to reject ozone content determinations, which measure the sulphur content in different parts of the country, had been announced in order to determine where this level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to meet the stricter air quality standard.
The 15 main democratic states, together with the Columbia Region, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision is illegal.
The Government of Donald Trump has tried to reverse several environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, according to which it is part of a more ambitious plan for economic growth.
But these attempts have led to counter-reactions among democrats and nature groups, which are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that the air intake of ozone-containing air may "deplete the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of becoming infected with respiratory diseases", such as asthma.
A pig can come to the party.
In Germany and cattle a party may come because the strong rain threatens the European Union's second largest producer of wheat, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may be that hundreds of seasons of weeks before harvest may mean that the fruit intended for the bread industry will only be suitable for animal feed.
"The quality of the wheat is far better than last year and worse than in 2015", said Agravis Raiffeisen’s analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of the wheat in wheat can be used as feed, which is twice as usual, in Agravis forecast.
Farmers as well as their European colleagues have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
The winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by the hot flush.
In July, Germany was hit by rainfalls, which have continued in August.
Many eyes have turned to Northern Germany, where rain prevents harvest.
So far, only five percent of the wheat has been harvested.
In the majority of the area, the harvest has not yet begun, the local harvest has been notified by the buyer of the local harvest in Cevavis.
"It's been a really rough day," said Frank Deckert of Rendsburg, the chief trader of Ceravis.
Consistency in everything, or the Finnish interior design scheme, is called out for by the protagonists.
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interstellars of brass homes, because through large windows, the views of Saimaa’s fish reach many (life) rooms.
Every step, the attempt of our northern neighbours to create both harsh and perfect (energy-efficient) homes begins to be seen.
In addition, Finnish wood-use skills in building and finishing materials, furniture and furniture deserve to be respected and respected.
Stimulating techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fair houses, both the builder and the (house) designer.
It clearly points out that black, white and grey shades of association, if these additional wood and plantations are added, can be very entertaining.
Good ideas can be picked up for a long time, because the Mass will last until 13 August.
Accessories and carts suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
At night against today, the line was drawn down to the weekend Festival Baltic and Martin Garrix did everything he could to remember the last performer.
During the performance of the Garrix, the people were in real turn - singing, festivities, dancing in a way that was admirable.
When Garrix finished, the whole mass was proteined from Pärnu Beach to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures of our photographers trying to catch the Week during three days.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing the potential opposition.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to go against the most attractive boxing match in the near future up to 66,7 kg in weight category, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in the ESPN office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, an undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked to the other end of the corridor to welcome the Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s Swamp Champion.
After a unanimous decision by Garcia, the victory over the second-time world champion, Adrien Broner, on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are part of the head of the scale table.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you luck."
Lomachenko protects his belt with Miguel Marria against Saturday night at 19 am ESPN.
When a couple played for photographs, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klima, pointed out that a possible conflict between fighters would be a “perfect measure”.
"I'm ex-convulsive," said Garcia.
"I moved up [3,3,5 kg] for Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm 6,5 kg small.
I want to go down in the light of my mind.
And he has to move up the lightweight [61,2 kg] and then we can fight.
Fans have wished for this.
Let's make sure they buy it."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The World of Pox needs this fight."
Klima raised the question of whether it should be paid to look at it. It is part of his strategy to let Lomachenko debut 61,2 kg by the end of this year in order to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 Nokaut) who is interested in looking at the winner of Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell's fight after their 23th prize round in the Forum.
"Looking at this fight could be costly because fans have wanted this conflict," Garcia said, saying later, that she would be open to fighting on any channel that offers the best financial package.
"We are the main player.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said that he thought Lomachenko was a great warrior and could go watch his Saturday match.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in praising Garcia, saying that he thought the three division masters from RISside looked "very slow; I'm sorry, Mikey... you wished for that nap. "
Garcia stated that the aim was to show the impact and then to fight.
The breasts confirmed that they felt how tensions are growing in the struggle between them.
"This is a battle to be realised.
No other conflict creates so much attention and sumina.
I am more than willing to work for it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is exactly that.
This is gonna be a good fight."
From what parts of the world are they moving to Estonia?
Last year, the PPA extended and issued a record of more than 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly traveled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, if it was decided last year to issue a temporary residence permit for 6702 foreigners, the number of years since last year was 4928.
Communities cannot tell how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be carried out at the Ministry of the Interior.
When nearly 500 students moved to Estonia a year six months ago, in recent years this number will be close to 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased sharply during the Ukrainian crisis - in 2014 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of Ukrainian citizens is increasing most in Estonia – last year 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than left.
"The foreign community has always been great in Estonia, and because of the complex circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many people are facing the family", stated Kristin Rammus, the Minister of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of students who had been granted temporary residence permits was higher than even the number of Russian citizens, although in ten years the total number of temporary residence permits has been higher for the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here to work in large numbers, then Russian citizens for their family migration.
"In view of this historic Russian community, they are more likely to have even the greatest family ties with people living in Russia," said Helina Maasing, migration scientist at the National Defence Academy.
"While looking at where Estonian-residual Russian citizens have moved to, there is immediately east-Virumaa after Harjumaa", he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens were granted temporary residence permits, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who requested to be granted a residence permit decreased.
"Hype is due to the fact that, instead of extending the residence permit, a new residence permit has been requested for permanent residence in Estonia," explained Ramus, the Minister of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in Estonian residence has remained stable for years rather than stable.
In order to continue to reside in Estonia, foreigners who have lived here for at least three years may apply for a new residence permit from the previous year.
Its aim is to promote the survival of inactive people.
However, long-term residence permits require, for example, five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit may have been reduced as well.
For example, last year was granted a residence permit for a student who has worked here for at least three years.
Now the students can change jobs, and the Estonian state no longer seems to be losing sight of whether the wage criterion has been met.
This residence permit became popular - applicants last year still hold passport holders (109), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
In total, 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese people, were granted a residence permit for residence in Estonia.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants has already been at 126.9.
In ten years, in fact, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are one of the most active applicants for Estonia's residence permit.
When three residence permits were issued in 2007 to Nigerian nationals, 200 last year.
Nigeria will come to study in these universities.
Estonian universities are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turkish, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely thanks to the number of learners.
They also have the rule that where the community has been formed, there will be simple others," added Rammus.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, just as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from London.
If about 6000 third-country nationals are granted annual residence permits, this is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union are to add more to the percentage of migration," Maasing commented that the figures are actually small.
According to the Statistical Office, 14 822 people moved to Estonia last year, but 13 792 people left here.
This means that immigration went beyond emigration for a second year.
The majority of the exits and immigrants are Estonian citizens, but more are among those who leave them.
For this reason, the migration of Estonian citizens was reduced last year by 2,000 people.
Estonians travel between Finland and Estonia in particular.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion takes on sats, converts and arguments.
The idea of the North is nevertheless history for Mary Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I could dream at a museum for hours and admire modern sleeves and collars.
If you do something about it, you will study it and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery.
Mammu Couture's global world may seem like a living stranger to some, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide what kind of pain your life is for.
I've got a friend who's got a whole sauna full of haute cuturre dresses I've created.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and wears a red carpet every day, he also wants to wear and wear the most beautiful dresses he has ever seen.
You can live your own life special.
The fashion designer does not recognise the gap between bright events and gray everydays.
It is this debate that led to a rolling plan to take the highest fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people, to whom the fashion will not often reach.
The mammoth collection was presented, for example, in Võus, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashions, where a 45- model royal deficit filled the whole street.
In Tallinn, there are often pop-ups, nods are well, but there are more emotions elsewhere - calling bravao, standing up, trying to thank you by the hand.
Most of the audience came to re-enact themselves, but now they're fans of Mammu Couture.
If you exceed human expectations, they'll be inspired.
And I like the feeling that I'm in my way of doing it like I'm on summer night.
We had a 50-metre-long red carpet, full of beautiful dresses all over the street, and it looked like they weren't going to end.
It is also not fashionable for a country to admit that the creation must be presented to a brilliant supermodel, and it is a pleasant place for ordinary women.
Often I call on my own clients - they're always happy to come.
It's such a nice experience, you can shine on the stage in a beautiful dress.
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my performance, I'm always behind the stage to give things the most sand as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerves wouldn't allow me to watch the show calmly.
Now it's this kind of tool manager, who doesn't just want to play a representative role, but to be in the middle of everything.
I have my sewing machine in the studio, I do most of the collections myself.
I like the whole process where you play with details, discover.
I'm never far from my work, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to fit into the day of one temperate woman's day.
These hours of work are still a great deal of work in fanatics.
I can't tell you when my workday ends, for me it's just a day full of joy.
I'm really lucky - it's like an incessant chain of luck: I'm doing something beautiful, man gets something beautiful, and he gets a compliment.
Many times it's been said that there are magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The vastly murky sacires that made Mary famous all night long have remained the signature of Mammu Couture until today.
Mürsepp U18 of the boys: the Estonians' sub-group weapon has now been turned on us.
I'm sorry, I'm in the middle of a fairy tale.
The first thing happened was that we couldn't get our hands on our desks.
And if there's such a big difference, nothing to do", Eesti U18 commented on the fact that basketball players 61:75 were left behind for the United Kingdom by our only basketball player in N.B., BC Kalev/Cramo assistant trainer Martin Müürsepp.
Opponents took 28 balls from the table and received so many more attacks as a result.
We were also not prepared to defend them aggressively or attack, it was created.
The enemy attack ended in three to five seconds, and we were unable to build protection.
In the defense, however, they managed to hold hands everywhere, and we couldn't fight.
It hit the ground on the floor feet.
The work of the opponents was done better.
According to Mürespa, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to remove the resistance from the ground.
The last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents have already received many quick baskets.
All of us were now turned against us now by the due diligence and close persecution that was on our side of the sub-group.
Today, we did not have the strength to resist their aggression.
The mermaid remained at peace with his care in Kalev, Matthias Tass.
On the tour in general, you can say good words about the whole team, so until today, there was a single shock.
It is a pity that such an aggressive opponent has already been met before.
The cup has always been self-sufficient and played out today, but it seemed like he was tired - he's been wearing a lot of money.
But he did some pretty moves I've seen in training before," added the tutor.
Fascinating numbers: In the number of these basketball balls, the EM tournament scored three quarters less than 10 points...
In the U18 age class, not only does the EMI B division of young men go to the basketball tournament in Tallinn, but women started last night in Dublin.
Estonia's game with Poland, unfortunately, was about anti-recording.
Estonia lost its cover, but after the third quarter, it stood at 9:49, perhaps only in the last ten minutes, the opponents took their feet off the leg, and that period remained at 16:16.
In the first and second quarters, Estonia threw 4, 3rd point...
In the first two minutes, the Estonians hit two of the first four whiskers, then they hit 25 of the game, then one in three, and then another 21 out of the game...
Soon, almost half an hour later, 47 shots of one were caught.
In addition, 2 points 2 out of 4 freeships came from the 4th freeships.
The number of loss of the ball during this period was reasonable, 12.
At the end of the game, Poland had 33 whiskers and Estonia had 13 percent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two disasters, and Portugal 83:16 was to be admitted on the first day of the week.
NATO ships are coming to Tallinn to supplement stocks.
Today, the NATO 1st permanent mine group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend for a scheduled port visit to Tallinn to complement ship supplies and prepare for future exercises.
During the visit, ships are preparing to return to the sea and provide crew members with the opportunity for a few days' holiday.
After a visit, NATO vessels will remain in Estonian waters to carry out numerous exercises and be ready for future operations in search of historical explosives.
"Estonian participation in the NATO unit and their cooperation in local waters reflects our integration with the Allied forces", said Master Major Arto Reinmaa, head of the operation and planning department in charge of the Navy fleet.
As of 29 June, a member of the NATO 1st Division of Mines shall be led by Lieutenant General Gvido Laudup, a Latvian Marine Commander, who took over the roles of the Supreme Commander of the United Nations in the ceremony in Riga, over the role of the Estonian Marine Officer, Lieutenant General Johan-Elias, in Seljamaa.
The group's flag is a Latvian Navy support vessel in LVNS Virseit, which also operates as a group leader.
This semester, the international entity is also represented by the military mine hunter Sakala of the Estonian Navy.
One of the four groups of vessels under the authority of the NATO Marine Authority is the NATO 1st Division of the Mines Fighting Force, which is a manufacturing unit of primary rapid responders, which may be sent to different parts of the world within five days.
Until 13 August, the ancient past of Pirita's monastery will once again become a place to be shot 13 years ago by the Brigitta Festival, which was launched by Maestro Eriklasi.
This year’s Birgitta Festival will receive the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Joszti (36) to be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Joost Risto: The audiences come to the classics of the opera world: "Traviata" and "Tosca", the ballet protests of the enchanting "Bolerost" fun "Karlssonin" and also the lack of an autoculture of Joseph Haydn's wonderful Oratory "Years" by the creative team of the same world, who in 2015 brought to the stage of Pirital Haydn's other masterpiece of creation.
The trademark fair is much more than just concerts and theatre performances.
It is greater than any music theatre in its usual form.
It's a festival where the spell takes power and never lets go again.
The experience that a listener can gain in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls sound and deals with human perceptions in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you have been the artistic leader of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't maestro's Special Klas' shoes look a little heavy?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Special Klas, it has been very helpful.
He directed me through my entire study career and also supported me at the beginning of my career in direction.
Maybe it's just because of this that makes it easier for me to continue her work.
In particular, she has given so much good to the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, all this will be transferred to me as well.
It was great to join a team who knows how things work out.
It was just a special big heart from Klas that gave me the strength to move ahead with Birgitta Földgitta Föld in Tallinn's Philharmonic, with the help of Birgitta Föld.
And here I am, and I can do it.
What could cheer the audience up at this evening's festival, what are your special offers?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and surprise to present the first ballet written in the story of Astrid Lindgren.
It's "Karlsson flies".
And one criminal nuance about it is that the author of this ballet is Juris Karlsons, the composer of Latvia, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
Apparently, he's had Karlsson's character in his life since he was a child.
Risto, how do you feel about all this?
Thanks to my supportive partner for sure.
Good work requires a system of operation and a lot of love, and that's what I'm lucky for.
And I have noticed that my personal feelings do not depend on as much on other people as on my own, as much on how I might deal with every new day.
And such an informed record keeping, keeping a good record and actually smiling at yourself in the mirror in the morning, significantly raising my fortune.
Especially now, when there are most important samples, I've been working on this especially hard, and it works.
Laughing itself will enact the brain and raise the tone.
It's just not a word for word.
I think that man doesn't know half of the things about his body that the universe offers him, but each one of you will gradually discover it.
In a moment, it's almost time.
Do you have any rituals before you step into the division board?
Yes, the cloth must be replaced for the more comfortable.
This is a moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I have no chance of resting or having a little sleep before the big show.
I even like to have an active conversation with people, even before I step into the division board.
But all of you come to the Birgitta Square, here's something to discover, not to a very big opera and ballet friend.
Enjoy the fun video with Risto Joost.
The following results of Swedish tests for the assessment of the age of Swedish asyl applicants were published:
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asyl applicants to evaluate their age with a new medical approach. Recent results show that more than 80 per cent of the subjects tested were rated as older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Legal Medicine (Rätsmedicinalverte) started testing at the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up for a more accurate assessment of age during the Asyl application after the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the age of several alleged minors.
To date, Migrationsverte has sent a total of 2481 tests to test 6880 and the Institute for Legal Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid to 31 July 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) was estimated to be 18 years old or older, and in 25 more cases, the Institute of Justice assessed that the test "may be 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the human being is "previously younger than 18".
The test shall be used only if the age of the person is under arrest.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Legal Affairs, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We do not see a big difference from last month's statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local newspaper.
The fact that much of the cases were assessed as older than 18, does not necessarily mean that asyl applicants have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said in 442 cases, "there are indications that the subject is 18 years old or older.
However, when the Svenska Dagbladet paper examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that 243 cases had been directly claimed by the man that he would be able to achieve this year’s 18th year.
This medical age assessment method, which involves postnatal X-rays and generational MRIs, followed by the analysis of dental doctors and radioologists, has been criticised in some areas.
One of the sceptics is an endologist at the Karolska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose tasks include assessing human biological maturity to determine whether they passed the puberty before or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the current measurement method should be used.
The determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we cannot be certain, then we should not pretend that we can," he said to the newspaper Metro.
The Johan Göransson Court of Justice protected the tests from the Institute of Legal Medicine: "Generally, the risk of child immaculately becoming an adult is low.
The risk of a person being a little less than 18 is at least about 10% at the highest."

The 20-year-old hammerer Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut in the World of London, getting a good 18th place with 67.
Orel was M.M.'s youngest female warrior, and a joyful woman confirmed that she was hoping to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well, and I had a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately took my average result, the second test (62.80) I risked too much and the third test (67.37) managed to keep my head clear," Orel said after the competition.
I was looking for my spell, and I'm glad I found it.
The debut of Maria Orel MM ended with 18 people.
The rainy Orel was not interrupted by Orel, because he's been training winter through the TT Stadium.
"I'm scratched," he said with a little baby.
The Olympic Stadium in London almost had a house full of people, whether or not Orel felt people around him or was able to turn himself off?
I get it, but in a positive sense.
Everyone says it's gonna give it a rest - that's it.
If you compete, you can try it.
Orel confirmed that MM's debut will be satisfied and that he is still waiting for a lot of good competitions: "I came here this year in season 32, i.e. with the final result, I finished at the 18th.
This is a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MMl - that's all that matters.
I'm going to have a good experience, and some day I'm going to have to fight for the Medal.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a party shift.
West Virginia's Democratic Governor, Jim Justice, announced at a meeting on Thursday afternoon with President Trump that he would change parties.
"Whether it's true or not, the Democrats left me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed so much and thought about it... today I say to you, to the West Virginians, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
At the meeting, joys came to light.
"It will become Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"I'd like to tell you that it's time to play another game."
Trump had previously promised a major announcement at the meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, the state's only billionaire, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that it owns coal mines in five states, and coal mines from his father.
His value is about 1.59 billion dollars.
At the same time, the National Committee of the Republics (RNC) announced on a Tuesday afternoon that "the party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would rather prevent the country from making a better change than working for it".
"The announcement by Governor Justice is simply the most recent rejection of 15 governors and control over the history of the highest number of states," said Ronna McDaniel, presiding Mrs. Ronna McDaniel, president of CBS, in her statement to CBS.
It is no wonder that where there is a lot of people, there are also many injured people.
Last night, Urmet, who was in the medical room last week, told the evening that they had to distribute a lot of patches.
The wild and wild are the main ones, out of twitching and light fall.
Of course, head, back and feet, too.
According to Mr. Urmet, the guests will come to the festival with false shoes, and so the problems will come.
The doctors have also had to assist visitors with a couple of major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one broken leg.
We have also made arrangements when a person has broken his hand or finger.
Smaller seams let's do this, bigger ones send to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the festivists are asking for a painkiller for treatment of pores.
Coe thanked the Russians for their sincere apology for the doping candal.
According to his words, Sebastian Coe, the non-governmental leader of the Light Force, said "Russia's Thursday's honest apology" because of the doping candal, but reiterated that it is not the time to allow the country to return to sport.
At the IAF Congress, which took place the night before the World Championships, the Head of the Russian Force, Dmitry Shylahtin said that the ban on competition imposed on his country is correct and has a firm purpose in combating doping.
He apologized 'to all the fascinated ones from whom the gold and silver medals have been lost in the contests.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the non-competition ban established in November 2015 after the World Anti-Dumping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of State-supported doping in Russia.
"I think this was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the journalist.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Union also admitted itself that they had had quite a difficult time and that they would make every effort to re-establish the Union."
According to Coe, he was pleased that Russia had accepted the criteria for reinvigorating itself.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the working group's proposal that this is not the time for Russia's withdrawal," said Coe.
"We must do everything possible within the next few months to make this normal.
We have always taken into account the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian facilitators, who meet the strict criteria of the IAAF, will compete as neutral athletes in the world championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia does not yet meet many renewal criteria.
After a report to the Council of IAA, he told the journalist in London that the doping regime was still insufficient and that the disabled trainers still operate freely.
The motor vehicle revolution significantly changes the demand for metals significantly.
Who's the winner and the loser?
The fact that the electric car revolution changes significantly from the fuel market to the infrastructure also creates new winners and losers on the metal market.
Although mining companies such as Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place to another, smaller mining companies will not help.
Glenbalance is now earning coal and oil, but in the era of electric cars, the demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel is growing.
This year, the decisions of the United Kingdom, France and Norway have raised their contribution to the spread of electric cars, which will allow the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming years.
So Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will place cheaper model 3 electric cars on the market.
Blémberg New Energy Finance forecasts that over the last two years, electric cars are sold more than those using petroleum fuels.
"For some metals, this changes everything," said Capital Farms Crete analysis Simona Gambrin to Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as caves and lithium, which has been growing in demand for years.
There are about three times more copper in electric cars than in the ordinary car, reports Glencore.
More copper is needed at loading stations, which, according to Exane BNP Paribas, will increase the demand for copper by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in the demand for accumulators for motor vehicles means additional lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese demand.
Glencore will receive income from the rising trend of electric cars from the copper price increase and from the world’s largest cobalt producer, forecast by Jeffers Group.
According to this broker, the other winners of the victory over electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market reacts to a changing trend.
This year, 70 percent of the metal exchange in London has been priced at a cave.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
The copper has also fallen 14 percent this year, mainly due to economic growth.
Glencore's share rose by 20 percent in London, reaching a line over the price increase to Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billito and Anglo America.
On the side of the loser, there are venturers such as Recyclx and Campine, who need to adapt to the new era.
Lead’s main end-use is the power supply of batteries for drivers of petrol- and diesel-powered cars.
Motor vehicles use lithium-accumulators.
"it is a serious risk to demand unless another purpose is found to overcome the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, metal market analyst of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
In the form of a lead price trend, the impact of the rolling trend has not yet been seen.
Pli is 17 percent priced this year, which is the best metal in London among the most important industrial metals in terms of price increases.
Investors will see a problem with metal in the long term.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars in competition," said Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
If the fuel demand falls, it's going slowly.
Maybe it'll be like this in 10 years.
In the meantime, tougher exhaust standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, dependent on frequent engine start-ups from advanced reciprocating batteries, will be assessed by an open lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as light metal replace steel, as a lighter car can drive further with less electricity.
This is already reflected in an additional 1.6 million tonnes of margin demand between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7 percent of the world's total production of aluminium.
This trend is likely to get worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year because increasing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
The steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce amazing motor vehicles.
Ka ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are trying to develop a lighter alloy steel to resist the aluminum.
"The overall steel should be the answer to this development," said Sylvain Brune, Analyst of Exane BNP Paribas.
Europe has some real successes.
The end of the oil age may also lead to suffering on the plate.
About half of this time last year was spent catalysing this precious-metal diesel-powered car, reports metal refiner Johnson Mthey.
"Many high demand raw materials such as oil and plate may not be in high demand in the future," said the Natixis raw material analyst Bernard Dahdhh.
This does not mean that the raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change within 15 years.
The record producers believe that there is continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Marc Grynberg, Uncore's leader, said that in 2025 more hybrids from full-fuel cars will continue to be sold in the year 2025.
In the 10 years term, the great hope of the platinum producers is for hydrogen-based cars developed by the Tokyo Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on the platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, this technology has not yet been commercially justified.
"Dise seems to be a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribass Brune.
In July, German car manufacturers received a major rebound because Stuttgart's court banned the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How football financial rules affect Neymar's transition to Paris.
The rules aimed at preventing unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar from changing world-classly from the Spanish and football club to the French Club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any action by UEFA, the governing body that is in the European game and which has the power to prohibit crews from participating in the prestigious Masters League market, will be waiting for Paris Saint-Germain to arrive.
UEFA's honest game financial rules in 2011 (FFP) mean that PSG must at some point prove that Neymar's transition was financed without undue loss.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (262 million) solely for buying out the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar's salary will be tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of the transition to the Neymar France Club.
The PSG will undoubtedly be able to recruit Neymar and add such money to its starboard line, given that the team is financed by the society that is ruling the disaster of the energy of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on recruiting players, but they need to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to come out with themselves in football.
The FFP was set up by Mr Michel Platinum after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
This former player believed that clubs that succeed in finding large debts would actually deal with fraud and risk dumping if banks or owners were to give up support.
From 2011 onwards, the FFP has focused on monitoring their losses instead of the debt of the clubs.
This amendment means that the business model Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea's in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then making a lot of expenses to make the team better and create a common brand - is harder to implement.
During the current three-year evaluation period of FFP up to 2018, clubs may carry losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platinum was banned in 2015 in disgrace of the President's Office, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceffer has still devoted himself to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not true and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules," said the Associated Press last week Andrea Traverso, a supervisor at the FFP in UEFA.
Although PSG paid Neymar for a buy-in clause in one total instalment, it is possible for them to allocate this amount for accounting purposes for the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract, which allows for the provision of a transitional fee over the next five years in the amount of EUR 44,4 million per year over the next five years.
For the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, received the most severe penalties at the neck of the city.
A fine of EUR 60 million (at this moment USD 82 million) was imposed on PSG, which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the Club was asked to limit the Team of the Masters League to 25 players in the 2014-2015 season.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to plan over the regulatory financial institutions by revoking its income through the companies related to the club owner.
A kari company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was high.
It has been said that a certain part of the Neymar PSG service can come from Qatar through payments from the World Cups of 2022.
However, PSG and Katar 2022 deny that Neymaris can become the ambassador of the World Championships and claim that UEFA regulators could easily expose such a maneuver.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to ignore the rules.
Ladies and gentlemen of the situation said on Thursday that UEFA has not discussed the transition with PSG Neymar in advance with the PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that they are guaranteed anonymity because they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that the PSG earned more than EUR 10 million of profits in the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of approximately EUR 542,4 million.
The latest financial year data have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to have a good impact on sponsorship trade, trade and trade in shirts.
The club expects an increase in turnover of at least 30 % in relation to the contract.
On Spain too, when clearly upset by the departure of one of the biggest and most important letters, Neymar tried to prevent the transition, claiming that PSG is ruining the FFP.
"This is a clear case of "money doping" with the club and the country," La Liga said Mr. Javier Tebas of Spain to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American Magade, shares La Liga’s view that the country is financing the club.
"This is the consequence of property rights, and it has completely changed the whole of the land before and during the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect financial rules because the country may have other ways or other interests to represent such a great player in the country."

50 years ago today: a hurricane-dimensional storm in Estonia, tearing roofs and windows from houses.
A century of storm called orca, which on 6 and 7 August caused major damage, in particular to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In the north-west of Estonia, during these days, the wind speed was more than 30 m/s over these days.
My old man ran from one curved tree in the garden to another and touched his hand to support them.
Everything was dark and stuck, like the end of the world.
Taama flew from the roofs from the houses, recalling the interview of Estonian Nature from the magazine Linda Kurova Haapsalus in 2002.
Linda's wife saw the garden that she planted collapses.
But what do you do with your hands to support trees where you can resist such a storm?
The sea came under the door, from window to window in water," said Mrs Linda, who was living on Haapsus Kalda Street at the time.
The fact that you were full of trees and the roof of the train station had flown 20-30 metres away, Linda saw most of the Hapsalus just like the next morning.
According to him, the trees behind Paralepa were in the ground, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looks very depressing, the storm goes through beautiful old trees with rags and prags like war.
In August 1967, Virumaa was not able to suffer very much in the West of Estonia in comparison with West Estonia, but the damage was great there, wrote Virumaa in February 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padis Park were swept off the ground, but our parks in the area also suffered a great deal of suffering.
In Tallinn, wind speed was measured at up to 35 metres per second, about 130 meters per hour.
In Tallinn, at the seafield on August 6th, a little girl in the evening of August 6 said: "Mom, mom!
Chickens are in the air and can't get down any more!", wrote Virumaa magazine.
The Põlli Manor building in the field was destroyed during the storm, so that it was decided to decompress later.
The August Storm was unable to withstand the constructions of the Tür mouth-to-mouth arm, which was no longer restored later.
On 12 August 1967, the newspaper Red wrote that the cleaning of cities and settlements from fallen trees and their branches would progress slowly, and the residents could contribute to the harvesting work.
The storm also suffered agricultural crops, and the newspaper reported that "the party organisations must be both promoters and directors of the organization and the harvest of the crops".
The hurricane can be spoken of if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of clean winds in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul was measured at 48 m/s for wind speed.
The measuring instrument was destroyed on the island of the plain story, so it was not possible to record exactly the wind speed measured there.
The secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning work and poor beach weather.
The colder summer weather also means a smaller harvest in Tallinn bathing areas.
"If it isn't, then there's people on the beach, and if it isn't, there's no people on the beach," says the cleaner.
In the north-city of Stromo, the south-east of the town of Tallinn, the south-east of the north-east of Strom, the south-east of the north-east of the coast, the south-east of the north
They will be offered a melodic competition by a low-speed tractor that will cut off the stripe on the plate.
In fact, the last of the last seven centimetres of sand is looking through by picking out the seagrass and left behind the people: caps, cigarettes and more.
People still come to the beach, whether or not water is warm or not.
If it is beautiful, then people are on the beach, and if not, there are no people," says Aleksandr Usov, Head of the Cleaning Works of the Haaberst Foundation, private company.
It is 6:30 p.m. and the beach has a bitter harvest job, since it has to be on the ground at 8 p.m.
Usov is on duty from 4:00 a.m. to work.
In addition, he will keep an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and Paljasaari Pikakar.
The waste amounts have fallen.
Years ago, it was much more than that.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning up the beach for 15 years.
It used to be that if something had been put up, it had already been broken the next day.
Now they're keeping what's on the beach.
Clean price price price prices price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price price
Larger works on the shores of Estonia are the cleaning of seaweeds or adrus that have been washed on the shores of the shores of Estonia.
For example, on the Pirita beach, it has to be transported to 400 000 tonnes on the coastal season.
"This is an incredible quantity," says Usov.
The second big category is domestic waste, or all that people leave behind.
There are eight large container containers on the half-kilometre of Strom’s strip, which need to be empty three times a week.
That's how much we're gonna get.
However, the colder summer weather has meant that the waste is five times less than it is otherwise.
The third species constitutes abandoned goods.
In most cases, these are the diets.
This time as a yield, Usov has swept out the area of the model car from inside the sand.
These owners are waiting for a frame to reach the beach.
"It usually comes out more than that, but it's a normal catch." Usov already knows he'll soon find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take the toys to drown them again in the sand.
The waste will be spread out.
The representative of Haabersti's administrative services, Erika Scholler, acknowledges that the screening work of the tractor is disrupted by locals.
Noise, which lasts from hours to early morning, interferes with the dreams of people living in the neighborhood.
On the day, however, this work is impossible.
One in six is to be screened twice twice.
"If we don't do this, the district will fine us," says Scholler.
However, the aim is, like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, to send the strom beach to the international blueberry quality mark.
"Compared to Europe, there is much more work in Estonia to ensure that the beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more flour and stones and harder to simulate sand.
However, our beaches are less of a commodity than elsewhere in Europe.
After hearing that the beach is talking about junk, Martin is forced to enter a press/harvest conversation session near strom’s beach, highlighting the current weaknesses of the beach.
In the morning, every side of the picture is gross.
The problem is with birds and harvesters who have pulled the garbage bags to the bottom," reports Martin.
While it may be difficult to assume that people can change their previous behavior, Martin expects the city to do something in a trash can and put them on covers, for example, to prevent at least birds from going there again.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of strom.
It can be seen that the city will take care of it.
With playgrounds, enlightened and recently asphalted teas, this has become more pleasant.
It was once so that only one way was allowed to ride the roller punches," notes Martin.
Findings of Arékeüt in strom: coins, only coins.
The 40-year-old Dimitri, who as a treasure treasurer is looking for a beach with metal detectors, has had to be used up for the long-lasting period of time.
He does not believe that today, nor will he ever find anything valuable.
The sea gods are not being generous enough to do this.
"I've been doing this for a year, and I haven't found anything valuable yet," says Dmitri.
As a hobia cardinal, there are some euro coins, caps and also dangerous nails in Dmitri's treasure bag, which later throws them in the trunk.
It's usually a coin.
"The gold, rings and the like are not usually", notes the treasurer.
Bank of England reserves interest at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates remain at the same level as they are due to the fact that inefficiencies in economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have been softened by speculation as a result of the increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain at a disadvantage, as households’ fixed income has put interest on interest rates.
The policy-makers of the monetary policy committee (MPC) voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 rates at 0.25%, and fewer members demand an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank dropped its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that pressures on households' incomes remained, as inflation is expected to rise by 3% in autumn.
In addition, the Bank also indicated that the increase in the rates is necessary to control the Brexit-related inflation over the next few years and that it may be necessary for the financial market to increase the cost of the loan higher than its average over the next few years.
The members also voted a year ago to withdraw the Participant of the economic mammoth package, which was launched as a consequence of Brixit.
In February, the Bank will close a fixed-term financing scheme offering banks a cheap financing, although he said that the plan now expects a bid of GBP 15 billion, which is GBP 115 billion, to be expected under this scheme.
In the minutes of the decision on the determination, the Bank states: "The GDP (GDP) in the mid-term estimates will remain ineffective in the near future, as the difficult situation of real income for households will continue to affect consumption."
With regard to the determinations, it was repeated that to correct the inflation, it is necessary to "sufficiently draw up a financial policy" and "at a much greater rate" than is expected on the market.
The stock exchange is now predicting the first increase in the third quarter of the following year and the second increase in the year 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any jumps were gradual and limited.
Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to May forecasts of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018 was maintained.
After this news, a pound of money went down in relation to dollar and euro.
The pound dropped to 0.5% of USD 1.33 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to change is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have confounded the growing hopes of growth as a result of the increase in GDP in the second quarter of the previous three months from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the previous three months.
It says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it will start to build up slightly at the end of the year.
The most recent inflation report gave little reason to cheer up households affected by rising inflation and terrible wage increases, saying that the situation is getting even worse before it improves.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent the impact on incomes in the next few years, but half of the forecast for the end of the three-year period is expected to recover significantly.
Due to weak pounds, the growing demand for British production also stimulates the economy, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs.
The decision shall take effect one year after the date on which the rates were introduced in August last 0.25% after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden decrease in the nail.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully absorb prices and the economy.
Before the final decision of the bank, there had been an increasing demand for raising the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on vulnerable households; in July, three policymakers called for an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although it was expected by the Bank, and is expected to return to recovery in the coming months.
Ü said that excessive growth compared to the 2-percent target was due to a total weakness of the pound.
Coreco, the director of mortgage brokers, Andrew Molake, said: "In view of the recent fall in exchange rates, it seems that the mortgage market is becoming ever more and more cost-effective, as lenders want to work and expect to finish the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end, as refinancing, often without a fee and at a low rate, has become increasingly popular."
The NHS has prescribed 10,000 people with a conflicting HIV medicine for 10,000 people.
Patients have since September access to preventive treatment of "transformative" HIV after a hit at the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that during the initial three-year clinical trial, public health is now estimated to make available to 10,000 people pre-exposure (PREP) tablets, which are given prior to the interval and have shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86% in high-risk people.
NHS agreed to finance a trial after the Board of Appeal supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year that NHS would be able to pay for the PREP, despite the institution's own claims that the medicine should be financed by the local authorities instead.
Simon Stevens, Executive Director of the NHS England, welcomed this movement announced on Thursday as a "new widespread intervention", while the National Aid Fund (NAT) described it as "in a reverse moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a course of HIV medicines that will be taken before an event to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials show that PREP significantly reduces the risk of transmission among people at risk of infection.
Before taking PrEP, it means that there are enough medicines in your body to prevent HIV from becoming infected.
Such medicinal products may be taken on a daily basis or no later than two hours before an emergency.
The suitable candidates include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated for treatment.
The clinics are identified by appropriate persons who agree to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, trans-European people and those whose HIV partner does not receive antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register their wish to participate in a local health clinic participating in the program.
The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England will sign a contract to get medicines this week after the international tender procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PREP by collecting clinical evidence of what the product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new widespread intervention should complement and boost the fight against the widespread and increasingly successful spread of HIV.
This is another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades with one of mankind's greatest health problems."
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of NAT, said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly aimed at those who need it and belong to a risk group, offers an opportunity to change the U.S. HIV epidemic.
Since September, people with high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool that is individually manageable and does not depend on negotiating with a partner, thereby improving many lives, through a clinical trial funded by the NHS.
We warmly welcome this communication."
Terrence Higgins Foundation Executive Director Ian Green said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial across the country is speedy pushed and that no HIV risk group member is excluded.
Now that the PREP's clinical trial medicine has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10 000 people at risk of being infected with HIV.
The Public Health Shadow Sharon Hodgson said: "The beginning of the PREP's clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and the Government's feet being dragged away.
Evidence shows how many changes this medicine may bring to an end the risk of prevention and the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take a step forward to fully understanding the advantages of PREP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be taken over as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and take us a step further to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
The price of electricity increased by 12% in Estonia, while the price of electricity in Latvia and Lithuania fell by 12%.
In July, the difference between the next day's electricity prices between Estonia and Latvia and Lithuania was reduced to EUR 1.94 compared to EUR 7.71 in June last year.
The main cause of the price difference is the failure of the Lithuanian-Sweden Community.
In Estonia, the average price of electricity was EUR 34,33 per megvat-hour last month and the price rose by 12 per cent from June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five percentage points from 36,27 EUR to meghat-hours.
In Finland, the price was 34,17 euros and the price for electricity Nord Pool's system price was at the same time EUR 26,37 per megwatt-hour.
Prices rose by 12 and 7 per cent, respectively.
Electricity between Estonia and Finland moved 75 per cent from last month's hours to Estonia and 16 per cent from Estonia to Finland.
The rest of the nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not take place for the next day.
Electricity between Estonia and Latvia moved 99 percent of Estonia from Latvia to Latvia, and 73 percent of the hours had full power available.
According to transactions held last July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the price of electricity in August can be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per megwt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the production price increased last month and transactions were made at a price of 5,04-5,47 EUR/tonne.
High living - half floor and smart design devices have turned this small apartment into a roomy home.
Joanne Ligh, a banker who is a passionate owner of real estate, changed his home to the Great Knightsbridge in July 2014 for the Court apartment.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed up her bags and resold her apartment is a tribute to a new design.
"before I lived with my ex-partner in Knightsbridge on a much bigger surface," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this apartment at Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and offered the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete innovation.
In the beginning, it had to walk through the kitchen in order to reach one bedroom and a apartment with a complex layout. Joanne wanted to add to the storage room and half to use the high ceilings.
"I wished for high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi, a design and design student in Notting Hill, Duck & Shed to take advantage of 3.8 m high ceilings and to create a home that is not just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a half floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to get involved creatively.
"Metal construction is quite complex," she explains.
"We had to reorganise the rooms so that they would be on top of each other without falling down.
This was not just about building a platform, but we used steel to make sure that the height of both the top and the bottom space is correct."
This setting enabled Erfan to create two rooms at full height in the room with plenty of dramatic elements.
On the other side, the modern copper light from the Retrouvius window opens up to the glamour apartment under the view of the view.
The mirrored golden furniture, silver details and retro-retro-retro-like Serge Mouille’s luminaire highlight space style.
The use of the mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatricality, space and lightness.
The mirrors are attached to each end of the back corridor to make it look like a look.
The kitchen leaves a mirror in the back wall of the other room as if it were an open window.
At the entrance, the mirror cupboard offers a place of storage for all Joanne’s tools and dishes.
In the living room, the ability to close the kitchen section will be added if not used, creating an image of a more global space.
Fermentary kitchens are nothing new.
However, in this kitchen, it is a unique fact that it is a garage type with a raised door.
"This was a little design trouble," Erf explains the MDF door with steel strength.
"It has a counter-optim, which is why it slides very easily if it is pushed up."
For the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, additional bedrooms and a better living plan.
"At the end of the hours, the floor is what you sell - or what gives the property value," says Erfan.
"The landowner enters an obsolete form of room and makes calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor by using high-quality materials that add luxury to space.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help create an emotional connection with home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electric shock in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart sound like a voice."
This shows that a good design and an increased area will help to make a rather unusual apartment quite a surprise.
In fact, they may even create a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
The main character, Dane Jensen, is a high-level bounty hunter, who competes with a colleague for a promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money earned, which is forgotten by any ethics.
He sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first part of the film, I thought it was the world version of "Card House" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech manager are similar.
What's going on, the smaller the element of the film house, but the moralizing intention of the filmmaker is becoming more and more evident.
For a moving experience, the main character will suffer from cancer in his son’s illness.
Now we have to make a choice between work and family life.
A dreamer son of an architect's office makes his father think about major buildings in Chicago on foot, like faith, goodness, love, and not even the disasters of the twins.
After the third scene where a son opens his face, it appears that the filmmakers have certainly started to cry because even with the deepest heart the viewer cannot keep tears from seeing the suffering of a sweet cancer boy.
When his son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, his father will finally understand his work's debauchery and do a good deed to an old man looking for a job.
Now, I'll bet on myself - if the film has a happy life, I'll present my vision after a movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the screenplayer can praise you for at least one drink.
For the moment, there is a doubt that I'm going to miss coffee - when the husband calls Dane from the hospital and the husband rushes down the hall towards the hall.
However, the son is greatly healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, this also turns out to be a good thing, because now it is time to deal with the family.
I can feel good about myself too - I know how to predict the story of the Americas.
In giving the truth, the film is well designed, and all the necessary elements exist.
Can cry, can laugh, actors are good and moral beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure it'll bring it in well.
The senior new chief of staff intends to control the media consumption of the President.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F.C. can really handle this.
In that case, he would be the first one.
Politico writes that the new head of staff in the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news, in the hope that it will keep the above level in water.
Here's a lot of reporters from Josh Dawsey:
"When John F.ke, the new head of staff of the White House, met with high officials on his first working day, he highlighted the key issue of President Donald Trump at the White House, which he planned to solve the bad information coming to the President's hands.
He told the president that the information had to go through him, whether on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if he was given good information."
The Kelly Diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried it, and they have failed to control Trump by tracking his media.
The presidential relationship with television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his television practice has gone nowhere.
"While Trump was upset by dishonest media coverage, he was rewarded to show that he was also fairly included in the affected publications," said former campaign consultant Sam Numberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that " According to six former campaign workers, the key to controlling Trump's best practices is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a confidently praise-absorbing feeling".
Okay.
The idea that the habits of using Trump Twitter have never been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us don't know that Trump's signals would have been even more exciting without their interference.
We'll never know about messages that Trump didn't send.
If his assistant was able to save him, even once or twice, from trouble, their efforts were worth it.
No one has been able to prevent Trump simultaneously to create a phenomenon.
The part of the problem is that people in the White House, which consists of competing clicks, are merely trying to promote their own interests by providing the Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not necessarily be credible.
In May, Politico, which reflects the whole story, wrote in advance in May about the willingness of advisors to feed to the President information of a highly dubious value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
"Previous and former Trump responders say that Trump can respond to negative pressure, especially to the harmful effects of the notes, explosively, with an obsession with the identification of their source source.
This also happened at the end of February when someone gave a negatively printed copy of the website of GotNews.com, which belonged to the Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walshi of being the source of the White House's non-information notes.
It doesn't matter that Johnson's been suspended permanently because of an insult or that he didn't provide any concrete evidence or that he's been making and taking them back in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking the defendants about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the current chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the Head of the White House's Office, Rob Porter, "have tried to establish a system for the management and documentation of hard documents at the Trump".
How did it work out?
The kõ will try to do exactly the same thing three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader of Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still fighting for influence.
These unchanged factors make the mission very difficult.
Road traffic traffic from a foreign capital city is not about to be allowed to perform as a performer.
A lot of foreign music is present in the city centre of Tallinn.
Those who talked about this evening admitted that they were playing in the city without the permission of the municipality.
The first thing we could find was three road users near Viru's gates who had taken as many dogs as they could.
It could be seen that musicians with raspberry and broken clothes were back-bag travelers who could use a shower.
In the face of appearance, the company's only wife played a story on the chorus with fun rhythm, while a man next to her played three balls at the juggler and called the passersby.
The second man had sat next to them on a backpack and smoked in his heart a self-published piece of shit.
These three dogs did not let themselves be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who played for Noem and with the balls, told the Arion that they were making music on the streets for both fun and money.
The purpose of the association’s attendance was to collect a financial contribution on a vessel flying to Finland on the same day.
Asked if they asked the city for permission to play in the city, to shake Noem and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we will never stay in one city more than a day or two, and most of the time, we will be allowed to do so for a month or so.
There's no point in paying for this," Bob explained.
About 20 minutes later, when we got back to Viru's gates, we saw two women staying with musicians and driving them away.
The company moved in with backpacks and dogs to the Viru Centre's intersection to try to be happy.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom was playing the violin, the other clarnette, and the other one was carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to offer people entertainment to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained Trio Pianist Mivosh.
Mivoshi says that they are aware that the performance must be authorised by the municipality.
"Of course we don't have it," he said in a joke.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, if the police come, we're going somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
In July, Eesti Pank purchased EUR 149 million in euro in the framework of the general government asset purchase programme of the euro area, the bond portfolio of the central bank increased to EUR 4,36 billion.
No more detailed information on purchases will be published by the region.
Eesti Hardo Hansson, President of Eesti Pank, has previously explained, in response to the deliberations of the members of the Riigikogu, that the Eurosystem central bank’s asset purchase programme covers three different categories: covered bonds (covered bonds), asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market to order the sellers of the bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing the return on low-risk assets and this motivates investors to take greater risks.
As a general rule, in the context of a public bond procurement programme, each NCB purchases sovereign government bonds, other sovereign bonds are not purchased.
Since the Estonian State has no bonds, Eesti Pank makes so-called replacement purchases within the amount allocated to them.
Replacements are also made by central banks in those countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
With Hansson’s approval, Eesti Pank buys European institutions’ bonds, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank’s bonds as a whole.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds under the asset purchase programme from March 2015 onwards.
In the meantime Elering's bonds were also purchased, but Eesti Pank has stopped buying Elering's bonds since June 2016.
From June onwards, both Elering and the central bank of Estonia will buy the banknotes of Eesti Pank on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore the pit and return to "Millions of Divisions".
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midlands have once again faced a fierce conflict with determined travelers who have ignored the well-covered well of the Council to win back the field that is left of their wool.
The Travelers have settled in their 20 trailer summers on the field near Solihuli Street, a prosperous "Millions of Divisions".
They have returned with the horse, children and truck fleet after they were thrown out of the country only in May, without letting themselves get mixed up in a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team held a weak position in the defences, squeezing its vehicles from the remaining part of the vehicle which was left to the fore.
The Commission of Solihuh, which has been closed by angry people, says that the council is "necessary to deal with the problem".
One anonymous resident said: "They moved there on a Monday evening after they had been exterminated from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be ashamed that they are going to act because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The Travelers were there in May, he timed out, and now they're back.
They came in last night, probably even more today."
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such things by obtaining long barriers to protecting its parks.
I live on the road to Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy that I have to continue to pay the commission if the council can't even do that."
One local citizen who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is ridiculous. We only saw how the last of these travelers left, and there is already another attack.
This time has grown a lot, and in grassland even a horse is being remembered."
The representative of the Solihuli Council said: "We are aware that the country near Streetsbrooki is an unacceptable campsite and we are working with the Solihuli police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as soon as possible.
The gathering of evidence will be very helpful if as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help to create an image of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekly Festival is also visited by the Minister of Culture, Indrek Saar, who is pleased that Estonia has been able to bring the real world’s top names into Estonia.
Asked why the weekend festival is so important to Estonians, the Saar responds to asking all those who enjoy the three-day talk to the festival fully.
But he does realize that the true workers of his field have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists who have been able to bring to Estonia, "the absolute vertices of this musician will be brought home - that is often not what happens in our wear," says the Minister of Culture.
What artists, though, do you think are most likely to speak about the island?
I think I'm a very old person, and for people like me, I'm sure it's one of the most unfortunate artists of all, Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
According to his recordings, all of us at any point have gone to pieces," he says.
However, he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian creators too: starting with NOIP, and they can be read whole.
In fact, this well-known concentration of names is very high," he says.

Updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism that has hit the car manufacturers.
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers software updates for more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the President-in-Office, the company believes that "there are more intelligent variants than driving restrictions", referring to European cities, including the city of Tallinn, Munich, which has considered prohibiting or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be upgraded for the emission of diesel engines.
None of the companies described these operations as recalling.
European car manufacturers have published the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States of America to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, oxides from diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and may lead to asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be installed for the neutralisation of exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies will increase, making it difficult to keep the car price competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the Government of the Union Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of treating powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of a problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who silenced the use of so-called Fraud devices that enabled the emission display to be adapted to the regulations while testing the car, but withdrew under normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been accused in the United States and others are on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean investigation.
Last month, in Germany, the Head of the Audi engine development department was arrested by the Vice-President of the thermodynamics sub-unit.
The former President, Mr Zccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from release and may go to trial in the United States of America.
At the beginning of this year, the audit in Germany was pulled into a court investigation on Volkswagen when the public authorities accused Audit of installing the system to circumvent European emissions requirements, thereby extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States of America.
Inclusion in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen, the manufacturer of luxury cars generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The European Union flags are being awarded to Estonian schools for 20 000 euros.
By 1 September, the school will buy the European Union flags to mark the Presidency for Estonian schools.
A total of 105x158 centimetres of European Union flag 570 educational establishments are obtained.
The flags are intended to be exhibited in the indoors, they must be carried out in a high-quality print shop in the indoors, also with a tunnel fixture, mediated by ERR’s newsport.
The Lippuvarda label says: "The gift for Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union of Estonia.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 at the price of the Ministry of Education, one ticket costs EUR 35.
The murder of a journalist is causing a growing threat in Mexico.
Workers on the weekly newspaper Riodope usually meet on a regular basis to review plans to reflect the latest chaos in the state of Toloa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
Today they are gathered in a shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own security.
They say it's important to change your routines.
Two of them will discuss what is safer, whether to bring the children with them to the office, which was the target of the grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the front of the room: "the enemy", "the neutral", "the allies".
They ask reporters to provide the names of each column with no evidence necessary, enough impressions and internal senses.
Being hired by the government or cartels is suspected of drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists as a whole of evils who are making it dangerous to reflect chaos in Mexico.
As far as violence is concerned, there is no breathtaking, and the more bodies are congested across the country, the majority of them, according to the Committee on Journalists' Protection, have since the date of the oath of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012, at least 25.589 journalists have been killed after attacks and threats under national protection and during this year at least seven journalists have been killed in all states.
The most recent deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce in Javier Valdez Cardenas, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His existence shows deep sense of his presence, although his presence can be felt everywhere on the ceiling of the Rioce building hanging a large picture of Valdez showing the average face with the letter "Justice" and two 30th reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts, which show his face with smiling glasses or his character.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate Public Prosecutor’s Office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, only two cases have been brought under judicial responsibility according to the Committee on the Protection of the Journals.
As in most cases of annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, ranging from thousands to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to court.
The work of Dome continues to reflect the violence in the Toloe, although their hearts are broken and the earth is now even more dangerous.
The Ibarra meeting on security is of no use to the data and justice of air murders.
"It's very stupid to waste your time at this meeting," he says.
"As long as the reason is not known, you will distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, the capital of the state, on the morning of 15 May.
He was only able to drive a few quarters before two men stopped him from the red Tokyo Corolla, forced out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means, in translation, "the twelfth river".
An armed man drove out of Valdez's car and made an accident out of nowhere.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a wife and a two-adult child.
Rumour has it that Culiacanis is free to spread.
Valdez is mainly a subject of silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since the arrest of Guzma last year and in January of his release to the United States, Selfalo has been one of the most bloody battle fields in the country since the rivals are fighting for the execution of the power to fight the rivals.
It doesn't matter that every day a person or even a person is shot on the streets of Tolalo, or that the corpses are swept up in an abundance of two-time drug mausoleums that are bigger than the homes of many living people.
Let me just forget that the time of peace suggests that only one fear leads to the state of the sea with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States of America.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers associated with his work, the Co-Chairman and President Ismail Bojorquez (60) felt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that the killing was facilitated by two faults.
The first of them was the publication in February of an interview with the dwarvesman Damascus Lopez, a cartel competing with the sons of Guzman and at war.
This letter may have upset the sons of the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they got to the newspaper shop.
The mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after an attack took place in one of the papers that gave rise to the same story.
Valdez was both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues expected that he would exist forever.
In 2003, he worked as a veteran reporter at Noroes, a newspaper, when he joined five colleagues to create a dome, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that in Toaloo "it was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
In time, the newspaper got a sense and a sense of sales and promotion with its bold and honest accounts.
The reporters liked to publish strong studies without fear of censorship and readers in an enchanting edition of which they could read stories that no one else would have dared to look at.
Eight years after Riodode was founded, the newspaper won its Latin American award for its latin American award for its prestigious Maria Moors Cabot.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award (ICC) for his courage to follow Mexico’s medical history wherever it takes him.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to move on," he said, accepting the AKK Prize.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that trafficking in drugs is a way of life in Tolino.
"You must accept the task of the press office with another option is to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The dome collective longs for Valdez, a joker who snuffed like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared the impressions and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They supported his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from his office to the El Guayabo bar across the road and always sat at the same table.
Now they ask if his love of routine became his destiny.
Her life has also made them question how to do her job best and survive.
"They don't like it when you pick up their women, their children, their legitimate business, the secret landing sites used to sell drugs."
"These things should not have been touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is that even at the best times, strong self-esteem and self-maintenance are weak.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away from it.
According to Dope editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier.
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Tamaulipasi, Veracruzi, Guerreros and other states that are home to toxic association between profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
The landscape is changing all the time.
The room where Riodode’s staff met for security training was suddenly no longer allowed mobile phones; a few days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two cops were looking for a relief from 40-degree heat in a tree.
The government ordered them to guard the Riodoce office in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Some reporters wondered half-witness if these police officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen the governor himself has called suspicious.
It has been a long time since the reporters have traveled to mountainous lands where control is in de facto revolutions.
The publication of the wonders this week discussed three key issues.
One of them was the murder of the brother of the former box legend Julio Cesar Chavez in Toaloa.
In addition, they had an outstanding record of government spending money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from the D.A.'s office in Culiacan, one of the most expensive restaurants in the quarter away.
There had been no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write what every restaurant in the city knew about it was both a place of trade and a place of worship.
The reporter found out from public documents that the restaurant has been registered as a politician in the Authority’s Revolutionary Industries (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the past year.
Recently, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in large-scale coverage cases.
The reporter asked the reporter to write about the previous incident in the same place, including how we called El Chapo's carrier Guzman's son escaped from the army.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have looked for Valdez's column to get information about kidnapping from the best sources.
"We would have known what had happened by now," said the 46-year-old Arrrea, whose dresser's design served him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels with our sources are lost."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the murder of journalists, and the inaction of employees has become something they never expected to see activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a couple of signs and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning to protest for another journalist.
Salvador disappeared three days after the killing of Valdez in the Republic of Micoacan in the Republic of South.
A burned body has been found, and according to the official, it belongs to him on the basis of DNA tests.
Presses throughout the country have become more louder and criticise the term "SOS press" as a group of protests on roads and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez will be in Washington, trying to collect international support in the Valdez case in order to set justice on foot.
The day after Valdez's death at the meeting with the Governor of Ilooa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked for him to be transferred from the government’s activities to another location, worrying that his objectivity had been affected by anger.
Valdez had once again said that Mexican journalists were "restricted in" by organised society, fellow civil servants and the interested society.
In his last book "Narco Press" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by the gangs, but are also done on the command of the politicians and the security authorities, who are organized to deal with crime.
Last year, Article 19 of the Media Monitoring Group, Articulo 19, dedicated more than half of the press attacks to police and public officials.
"Mexican you die because they want you to remain silent," said Ramirez.
The murders seem to be attacking by the carnage.
Never forget the death of bija Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulpasis six years ago.
His body was found with a letter signed by the fear Los Zetas: "I'm here for my reports."
By the end of the head he was cut down, computer activator and headphones lay next to him.
Some have decided to close their doors, for example, in Chihuahus, the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuhus, after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue to do as they did in El Manana de Nuevo Laredo, their president, in 2004 when he was murdered by El Manana de Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez drug cartels were referred to by Diario de Ciudad Juarez under the instruction: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left the country or even the country.
It's a ghastly decision.
It's hard to find work in Exil, and they still have to look out for streets to avoid threats.
And sometimes they are being chased, as happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered together with four women in 2015 in one apartment in Mexico three months after leaving Veracruz.
Those who remain in office and continue to work need to talk about risk-taking decisions every day.
Ibarra, who ever wanted to become a poet, admits that the appearance of a drug business scares him.
"Mexican's on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At the midnight of one recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked up, the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the front of their head on their ass and threw beer when they suddenly started vibrating all the phones.
In Mazatlanti, a deaf town along the coast, 19 persons were reportedly killed in the fires between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as did messages from several cartels found in the region.
On the same route as the same reporters put news on the website using the mobile phone using Riodope.
the next day, the front page needed to be changed.
Sirenes hurled all over another area of fire.
Bojorquez was on alert to police officers to see if they were alert.
If they were, they wouldn't show it at least.
The founder of the fallen newspaper under a massive press, where his average finger is visible to the whole of the Tolino, was carried out by the Dome staff in his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "as if, on the same day that Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send him to make a return to the streets?"
Dinosaur used the protection colour to prevent enemies.
At first glance, it seems like an image, though quite scary.
Scientists have now seen the first findings of the unbelievably vastness of a chicken miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauruss".
It has been so well preserved that it was even possible to prove that the skin covered with his arms was a red brown color and its past had been somewhat "tough".
The report published in Current Biology described the entity as "the best preserved armor dinosaurus ever found" and as "one of the best dinosaur specimens worldwide".
Fossil is a new type of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the period, 110-112 million years ago.
An incredibly good survival of open scientists who describe it as "really significant".
According to the National Geographic magazine, this armoured vegetarian has best preserved this type of fossil that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined the Suncor Millennium at a mine near Fort McMurray in northern Algeria.
There was something again that did not resemble the surrounding stone and decided to look into it.
A museum of paleontology was sent to Royal Tyrelli from the open.
For the next six years, it was developed to extract the animal from an area of 2500 pounds (1,100 kg) of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is finally ready to bring the public forward.
"If you cry out in the eye, you can almost believe he's sleeping," said the leading author, Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"it goes to scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
In his examination of the skin, researchers found that this vegetarian, who is covered with armour and resembles a shifting tank, was likely to be threatened by significant meat-food dinosaurs.
This multi-armed dinosaur used a red and white protective color to hide from predators, and applied a parasitic technique called a shadow and used by many animals today.
This, according to experts, allowed dinosaurs to be better placed in the neighborhood and prevent enemies, since the larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt him down.
This 110 million-year-old nodosaurus family creature came to the news for the first time in May and is now visiting the Royal Tyrelli Palace Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it Borelopelle markmitchell Museum's laboratory by Mark Mitchell, who was a member of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours looking at the animal at it.
Thanks to the surprisingly good preservation of the individual, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the arms on the body.
They discovered a counter-intelligence - a common defence method in the Republic, which means that the top half of the creature was darker than the bottom.
Although there has been a widespread spread of antagonism, the findings come as a surprise, as Borelop is much larger than the animals today living with antagonism.
This suggests that dinosaurs were sufficiently hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs that the evolution preferred to defend itself as a survival act instead of a conflict.
However, most of the animals using modern resistance - e.g. deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable as yields, which suggests that nodosaurus had to seriously bother to survive.
"The powerful hunting of a dinosaur, which is so large and full of armour, shows how dangerous they could have been to prey on a period of time of dinosaurs," said Brown.
Chemical analysis of Armoured Organic Compounds revealed that the skin of dinosaurs was red-brown.
Scientists will continue to study the animal to obtain clues about this life, including the preserved content of its intestines, to find out what the animal would eat for the last time.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into a dying river, thus reaching the sea with a stream where he sank his back to the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Albertas was as warm as today in South Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to extend much further to the ground than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is very significant because it is completely covered with preserved skin, while it remains three-dimensional, retaining the animal's original shape," said Brown.
"This is the result of which the animal today looks almost the same as the crucifix.
There is not much to use to reconstruct this imagination - it's just enough to scream your eyes and it seems like she's asleep."
The time of the crisis was the time when the earth traveled by the huge two-legged meat-eater dinosaurs - theodillos - on two feet.
Although all of these King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than in Borelope, some of his frightening predecessors may have been hunting this armored dinosaur.
These include Acrocantosaurus, a monster weighing 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and six tons.
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in Current Biology magazine believe that Borelople was proud of the sea after death and that mummification was mud.
The presence was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Algeria, Canada.
According to the museum, it has been best preserved in the world of Armus Dinosaurus, including skin and armour, and it is a whole cone from the hips to the hips.
On average, these beings were 18 feet (five metres) long and weighing up to 3000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Two 20-inch ora from that shoulder was punctured into a two-foot-long oracle.
Scientists believe that this wild-bodied vegetarian was going through the current West Canada until the flooded river was threatened with its open air.
However, the dinosaur's suburbs were helped to preserve its armour in a very detailed way.
The stoned remains of this particular individual have been so well preserved that the remains of this particular individual are still covered by the remains of the skin, along the top of the dinosaur skull of the murky armor plates.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geographic: "This degree of preservation is as rare as winning the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it feels.
Stinky leather remains still cover the mural armor plates on the animal’s skull.
The right foot lies next to him, and the way from the toe has been stretched upwards.
I can count the weapons on his back."
How did one of the activist answer the question, "Who are the streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell received a total shock.
The only day after traveling to New York, it sat in St. Louis's resident Airbnb in a rented room bed, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He got caught up in a post from his former schoolmate.
It said, "Police just killed a 18-year-old, and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had sent this information to his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened up Twitter.
Pidemega @TheePharoah's mail had been distributed on a number of occasions in his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area passed on Michael Brown in real-time, unarmed for the death of an 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white policeman in Frisbee Missouri.
He posted a picture of the Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"It's crazy," he thought of Ferrell himself.
Life was nothing to him or to his community.
He hung up his phone, but later later he saw the noise that reported on this occasion gathering of people on Canfield Drive.
Photos of the police and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a note saying, "Ferrison's police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time stream where a cop was standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop pulled a gun in his mouth and screamed, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and what we might call typical."
At the moment, I felt a sense of terror.
I was angry and cried."
He booked a flight back and drove home the next day.
When he landed at 23 o'clock, he went to his father's house to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided that they would drive the next morning in the same room as the two of us.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson the next three years is the central theme of the new documentary "What Streets?", which will appear in cinemas on 11 August.
It's a story of survival and protest, love and loss, goodness and courage from the sight of people who live in this community and who have answered the questions in the street.
When Ferrell and his daughter, who wore a flower dress and had the appropriate crown in it, went to Fergusso, they spoke again about the experience and living conditions of black people, which they had talked about before this evening before.
"Do you remember when I taught you how to defend my rights by the black community?" he recalls asking himself.
"We're going to Fergus right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take him with me," Ferrell said later.
"What is happening now is... the future conjugation of what has happened.
He needs to know and see and grow in the middle of it.
He needs to learn about activity and organization, and at the same time feel the different layers of black experience and living conditions and what we need to do to be free and free.
Even if I succeed in raising him by not personally taking a personal stand for racism, he will not be different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do her a bear's favor if I protected her from this world."
The first stop they made when they arrived at Fergus was on the road to South Florida - the police station across the road, which had become a certain kind of campsite where the activists were waiting for news of the police officer Darren Wilson, who was not even charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined a local businessman who made lunches.
They put together food bags and helped them to share with protestors.
For Ferrell, a new type of activity began to slowly take the form of a new type of activity.
"My activity changed completely after 9 August," he said, pointing out that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was President of the League of Education Students of the minority and focused on food law and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organisational experience.
It's all just a lat."
Weeks later Ferrell met with Sabah Folayan, co-director of a film during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, the film operator, were just trying to document what happened.
A question came up in Ferrell's mind, "Are you trying to document what is going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism is due to the innumerable number of cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard, and we wanted to do so differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for the activism of prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement changed the project attractively for Ferrell and six other places to film "Whose Streets?" the team watched for years after the shooting of Brown.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"For me, the important thing about how these people are portrayed, because that's how they look at me."
Although the aim was not to focus on the experience of Ferrell - to show that the movement was not "the guidance of the redeemer, but the meeting of the community", as Folayan said, he became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "What Streets?" is documented by the most personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as love and marriage to his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing for the first time when he was ready to see a linen work.
"But I realized that this work and the humanisation of black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story underlines and reintroduces the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider movement of Black Lives Matter.
Two of the three initiators of the movement who thought about social media in 2012 following the killing of black teen Trayvon Martin, the topic references #BlackLivesMatter, are homosexual.
"In the leading role, black homosexual women have maintained the movement in general," said Ferrell, "and this is precisely because we have to fight on several fronts constantly.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden."
Folayan agreed, pointing out that "the movement is actually kept by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He claims, however, that "it is not a question of creating any equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the center of the film because of her identity.
"He was the person with the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman, living in these places is much at stake.
"His energy can be viewed through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras are long gone from Ferguson, but racial links between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional penalty imposed on Ferrell for blocking the road at the time of the protest is still 2,5 years.
He describes the social policy atmosphere in the region he calls home, just a "stomach explosion".
However, he still attaches importance to the mantra that he has fallen into memory since he went all three years ago to the streets of Fernando.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's an obligation to win.
We must love and support each other.
We don't have to lose anything but our chains."
How to get over the top of the week's party after the weekend party.
Some of the stronger men find out after a nap that what's going on, that's gonna help.
Or they may be referring to the term "out of control, stay drunk".
But this is just an inevitable delay and a good health problem.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning after today and we'll see the Weekly Trall - or whatever else we need to do - and get over it as painlessly as possible?
Drinks of water.
Alcohol down and down, after a great morning, or, if possible, instead of an ana.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid while drinking alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
With water, minerals are also washed out of the body, and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritable after drinking, it is especially good if it is bubble-free or only slightly gasmed.
Go for a walk.
It would certainly not be worth going to Grandma's house to break trees - this could be a fatal wrong decision.
A slight walk helps the body to remember what it's like to be alive.
In the tent lying down and lying down in the bottom is a more demanding way to heal.
Give your body the energy back slowly and carefully.
If you've already done well since last night's drinking, you should definitely try and load a big fat steak into the stomach.
Start with a fresh juice containing sugars in your body that are silently broken down.
While around lunch is suffering from health, you might want to try some broth, for example.
And then a little bit later, the back of the back.
Sneak coffee.
This drug will release your body from any water.
As you have already said, water and juice are your friends.
To contribute to the pain absorbers, encourage them to contribute to the pain absorbers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent pain in the evening, you have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and lose your performance.
So you're going to ruin your liver even more and then you're going to get worse.
In addition, the analgesic will not last much longer anyway in the body.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it's gonna upset your already ravaged stomach.
Or if you don't take a partner, you'll be fine with yourself.
It works as much as walking, but walking does not get orgasm.
However, too active a tempo and frantic poses during the period should try to be moderate in trying to be moderate.
You got to be kidding me.
Time with a friend-tacker, stupid talk, make simple nonsense, and smile nicely over yourself as well as other (principles) people.
A joke and a laugh may not make you laugh, but it is certainly more fun to bear the consequences of them.
Once it's over, it's over anyway.
The professor of the department and the staff of the University of Oxford are wanted as suspects in the murder of the University of Oxford.
According to the report, the University of Northwestern University professor and the staff of Oxford University have been searched nationwide for suspects after finding the body of men with deadly stab wounds in one of the luxury apartments in the United States.
According to the Cook County Court case, on Monday, without bail, warrants were issued for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Warren, accused of their alleged connection to the death of Renton H. James Cornell-Durnleau in the first-year murder.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Durunleau died after multiple stabs.
According to a warning issued by the police department to the community, the body was discovered on 27th of July.
The cops received a phone call and found a victim who had multiple stab wounds on the way to the Grand Plaza apartment building.
According to the officials, Cornell-Dunleau was identified as a murder at the scene and the investigators considered the stabing to be a murder, while the police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology since 2007 at the University of Northwestern.
Vice-President for Public Relations, Alan K. Cubbage, said in an e-mail application that Lathem has now been temporarily suspended from work and is prohibited from entering the cities of Northwestern University.
"This is now a case for the competent authorities to investigate, and the University of Northwestern is working with investigators," said Cubbage.
Warren is an senior assistant at the Financial Department of the University of Oxford Financial Department.
The representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the police in the United States and have prepared to assist the U.S. research authorities in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wished him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglidel, president of the Chicago Police Department Communication Department, insists that suspects give themselves up to the authorities.
"Polices have an idea where they are, but we are working more and more on determining the exact location," Guglidel said.
According to the gugligel say, the suspects will help them to search for local, regional and national authorities.
Guglidel said that the police received a phone call from the operator of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a crypt tip that something happened in apartment 1008.
According to the description of the police, it was a magical view.
According to the Gugge, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July as well.
He said that security cameras confirmed Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglidel.
The following management sent a letter to the population: "The police are currently working on the identification of the history of the chronology and the victim's background and investigating different motives, including the possibility that this was a family member."
Enterprises that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber.
Veett wanted to measure employee confidence in its e-commerce start-up company, but the surveys were useless.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some workers did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Jõtt, who manages an e-commerce company, Madison Reed, which sells commercial goods with 75 employees in San Francisco.
He called on external persons to help him.
New types of start-ups dealing with human resources are at stake, which will help companies to identify how their employees feel.
Development and licences of software, which is determined to measure employee involvement, allow companies to conduct a series of interviews, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and complaints hotlines and, in some cases, allow them to go through C-level guides and directly contact the board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where's Fitbit for your company?" Jim Barnett, co-sponsor and CEO of Redwood City, Glint, whose software research is used by companies to measure employee involvement, asked for Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO.
According to Chechnya, in the three years he has been using Glint, he has gained a much better understanding of what his employees think and feel.
In addition to the follow-up studies and surveys directed at specific teams, it offers a company's credit card, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which leaders have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must remain aware of their work culture in order not to become the next Uber that has been wrapped up in scandals since the former employee published a post post which described an agitating environment in which those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to own a survey is a profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance area may be worth more than 118,7 billion dollars by 2020 according to the website Let's Talk Payments data for financial engineering statistics.
A start-up company in Denver Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, noticed an interest and growth in Uber's suspicious reputation this year.
The Convert has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered himself as a customer.
Like Glingki, the Converent allows companies to send customized pulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and look at maps of problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous communication service that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the Executive Director, the appeals go directly to the Governing Board.
"The public opinion has taken over the regulatory authorities," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of the Convercent.
Quinlan said that if an undertaking is found to treat its employees badly or to be inappropriate, the company may have serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, workers leaving and cases, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain with more than 25 000 employees in 500 sites, has spent more than a year on the Convertworld to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and operations and provide an easy way of communicating with the corporate headquarters.
If the employee wanted to report the problem in the past, he had to contact the company headquarters’s telephone number or email address, file a formal complaint and hope that it will be taken seriously.
It was a often shocking and uncomfortable process, said General Adviser James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday, who claimed that there was no good way to monitor workers' complaints.
However, now that the company is using the Convercent, there are potential problems, such as discrimination, harassment or dishonest wage practices, which have not yet reached the leadership of other cities or states, to identify and deal with more effectively and effectively.
"I have access to the holographic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who is leading the Ruby Tuesday Risk Management Team.
"And we will protect our members from disputes with employees."
Quinlan said that companies started to take much more seriously in 2002 for ethical conduct, values and employee involvement, i.e. after Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical irregularities in connection with Enron’s scandal.
However, only when the "social media grew up", the companies realized that they couldn't prevent them from washing their stuff online publicly.
"Before using technology to monitor your behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convertent provide their software services as a service, receiving a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
In February, the Converent was financed by 10 million dollars by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, increasing the value of the capital collected to 47 million dollars.
Glint invested $10 million in Bessemer's venture partnership in November, increasing the company's total fund to $60 million.
Such investments will not come as a surprise if account is taken of the relationship between enterprises, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that today’s employees expect more and more jobs than before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just bets on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to an undertaking that has a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, they feel that they are being listened to and that the work they do is satisfying, they are more dedicated to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Department for General Benefits and Staff Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both the Convence and Glint.
Investors earn income when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are dedicated and involved.
If the analysis tools of the third party allow for a higher level of employee commitment and involvement, it is no wonder that they will find support.
Owning knowledge of employee involvement is important to the opinion of professional experts.
However, these data will be useless if the company's supervisors do nothing about them.
In fact, when an undertaking requests feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that changes will be expected.
And if changes do not take place quickly or at all, this may lead to disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you ask 4 000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 conversations," said Kotter International President of the Advisory and Business Administration, Raath, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
'Cause if things aren't done, the workers are thinking, "Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why would I care?""
In his speech, Madison Reed, who is carrying out six investigations among the employees, has been able to take action on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
After receiving feedback from disappointed workers after the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
Ruby Tuesdays, however, collects new data on employees and it is expected that in the long term this will lead to long-term employee commitment in the industry, which is well known for its large labour market flows.
"If you are not devoted to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose businesses."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing rapidly.
Although the 2008 crisis and trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic countries are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg, referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to central bank data, since May total economic output per capita in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania has exceeded expectations.
At the back of the road is the low debt burden, the institution is rapidly improving and business and free-market-friendly policies are improving.
"Baltic countries with one Slovakia are among the few euro area countries where the real NCB per capita has a significant convergence with the EU average," reported the central bank.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total economy per capita is equal to the wealth of Western Europe, in 2015 the total output of the Baltic economies per capita was made up of the average of only 2/3-15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement.
Low wages have led the Baltics to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is growing this year, the local people are not enthusiastic.
According to a recent Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the population of Latvia and Lithuania estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, this was considered to be less than half of those questioned by the economies of their countries.
NCAA’s decision to cancel the twice-a-day exercise will make Bruins’ days long.
It's almost 23 o'clock when the UCLA football team stops for a chat at the edge of a new training field in the campus of the campus.
Some of them have peeled off their shirts, revealing their sweaty backs from the work of the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these hours of time will give them a break from noon.
The players taking part in the summer courses will head back to the finals of the joint assembly after three hours of training before returning to the Wasserman and Football Center at 6.30 a.m. next morning.
"The next three days are a real challenge for them," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
NCAA's decision to cancel training twice a day to reduce the load of players has actually made their days longer - at least until the final exams have been completed on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA’s first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 7.15 p.m. in order to fit in with the players’ already on time.
The switch from two workouts to one day means more days with one workout - the start of the Bruins training camp was increased compared to the previous season almost a week's advance and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons during summer courses.
They are scheduled to have 18 training sessions until 20 August before the formal preparations for the opening of the September opening session against the A&M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA amendment, although it adds one more item to the close agendas of players.
"They have a huge burden on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," Mora said.
"And they will break through this trial; they will struggle, they will be beautiful young people.
I believe that when the weather comes and we have more time, it will be really nice."
Once the camp is over, the training of UCLA will be closed, which is not an easy task, taking into account a clear view of the parking lot close to their fields and from the nearby Luskin centre, a higher-class hotel that has already received access to the gate mail from the surrounding protection network and the football.
From this weekend, the Bruins players are occupying the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems may arise with free rooms during the season.
"We are going to establish security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real concern, and it is not overstated to think that people can rent a room and film a workout there.
If you have a record of your workout, it might make a pretty good deal.
But we'll use security in there and on the 8th parking lot.
Let's do our best to make the best use of what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about it very much.
We're in a good place."
Remuneration for revenge on the Savisaare-Ivanova Union, Kristiina Ojuland and EKrest, born in Savisaare-Ivanova, who were forced to leave the Reform Party to join the forces of Maria Kaljuste, created by the merger of the forces of Maria Kaljuste, who had been forced out of the Republic of Estonia, created for our Tallinn and our parties to take up the election of hopeful businessmen.
However, the chicks will be seen in autumn, and the key question will be whether they all have enough disappointed voters.
Who's left with the Saviar?
Once the support of Edgar Savisari has become small, there may be no suspicion of events organised in honor of his union of elections.
A single member of the Riigikogu, some former and present middle districters and many unknown faces - will this be the union of elections?
Is there any reason why some of the faithful followers and friends of Savisaare circumventing applying in Tallinn could be considered to be the reality of the exploiter 'Savisaare List', which is facing corruption and suspected corruption crimes?
On the Russian-language pop song of the music video recorded on the municipal roof of Lasnamäe, the elder of the district; and in any case the original computer, in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, when riding on a bike, must avoid the noises and squirrels of the road - is this the environment’s first-ever voice of 16 and 17-year-old voters allowed to vote for election boxes?
We look forward to what other political parties think of a young election campaign.
If Channel 2 or TV3 viewers receive a black square instead of entertainment from the beginning of August, two options remain: to agree that only ETV, ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and English France24 channels, or to give up every month a tenth of a month television operator in a free range.
There are also those who are likely to make public ad-free television fun at first, but, although they are reluctant to pay for television and advertising.
The music that locks the ear, the loud people and the trash on the streets are the unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
However, if you do not want to get a share of your memory, it is worth going home to the country to find out about the country and to leave the place of sleep for the festival village if you don't want to get a share of it.
Washington changes the card number of the data.
The press releases cite President Donald Tõmp, who said that a new U.S. immigration plan is planned to change the code of the map.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The Bill of Bills will discuss this matter in two Chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money because it changes the way the US issues green cards to nationals of other countries.
The law will reduce outreach and replace the current programme.
The new application process provides an advantage for candidates who speak English and have financial resources to support themselves and the skills that benefit our economy," Trump said according to the United States media publications.
The Siberian seto young people are moving to the city, pensioners are returning to the country.
Yevseivi Anatoli will once continue the tradition of the famous gold miners of the famous set off the Earth River.
He works at home 140 kilometers away from Mana's additional river, on display, as a driver in a hardware store near Kui.
It's hard work: two months in a row without weekends 12 hours of work and then only 10 days at home and back.
Anatoli has only seen gold once in a three-year period worked in the Artillery.
"There is a hard time: when you go in, you will be thoroughly checked that the wine does not bring it, and going out to avoid the gold," Anatoli says.
Mare Piho is talking to the local seto Jaan, who has told her a lot about his family's memories in Siberia, in Haiti.
The remaining arctic culture of the Siberian setos will also affect domestic sites, because it is just so amazing, it believes that Piho Mare, who has studied the far-distant setos, considers them most closely.
His first visit to Siberia will take 30 years this year.
During this time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a total of one year.
How many sets still traveled out in Siberia at the end of the 19th century and in the early 20th century to get to this country?
This is an uninterrupted question.
I'm saying it's $8,000.
I've calculated it for the siber's set of men who have thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say, because at the time, up to 30 people in one group could have come, but the passport was only given to a man.
Pass was given only one, but with him there were children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look how big this territory was here.
This was many times larger than the historical Setomaa.
After all, it needed to be educated, managed in some way.
Setod came here as farms, but their life changed, because here they came into areas that were not only related to agriculture but also to the river (wheating), gold mines, industry.
For example, many Setods later went to work in a classified city in Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built a U.S.-U.-U.P.) when it was formed.
At that time, the Setos formed a majority of the population in this region?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, there was a long tradition of getting married and becoming many.
Seven or eight children in the family were normal.
How much different is the culture of Siberian setos and different from that of the country's setos?
They are different, although what was brought here was never the same there.
They brought in a lot of peoples.
Then they made their own (Civils), but they always made a difference between what had been brought and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothing of setos, because it's colder here.
Food changes.
For example, in Setomaa, the meat was salted, but it was just outside here.
Where are the villages of the Siberian Setos and what kind of life lives there? / graph: Alari Paluts
The communication with the country was spiritually strong, it was considered very important.
I think now it's starting to return to Setuma, it's starting to affect them.
Those girls who have lived in this family have listened to amazing stories.
PHO means the people of the Estonian Setos delegation who first came to Haiti to visit Seto Kingdom Day in the beginning of July and lived in homes for four days - J. P.
What's left of it, it's amazing.
"It is very easy to come and go, because the city has a good place to live: at a railway stop and at a crossroads point," says Reigo Tamm, from Ooperisolist.
The city is no longer just a military capital for a long time, we have a lot of nature, sport and nature, and we get pizza at every corner.
The way is a torch-thop city.
There is a small island along the White River running through the city, where killers tend to have a jaan party.
"It doesn't look like this beautiful place in the train window", says Reigo.
Anyone who is not afraid of cold water can swim in the river because the river is full of springs.
I'm swimming there, man. I'm gonna be fine.
On the riverbed, you can have a picnic and just make a romance - you can look at the flow of the river and think ahead and back of life.
I'll be there walking with my girlfriends.
Pastor Tamm is, apart from everything else, on the riverside between three bridges, practicing his own treasures: "For this place is by the city, there may be no one who can resist when his stories sound."
"There is a wonderful view of Tape, but there is also a health trail where you can run, go skiing in the winter, and now play discgolf, for example - a golf course has been made, discs can be rented from the sports center", Reigo is headed by.
Of course, old professionals go there with their disks, but I haven't been able to play there yet.
It is probably necessary to invite Rasmus Kull to visit Tape first, because he has experienced discgolf player and has a disc.
I think he's lending me a loan.
The Reigo and Pine Mountains were no longer the current operas of their childhood.
At least during the whispers.
There are a lot of tears, disappointments left on this mountain, and you can be in my sport.
Not to mention the broken hemorrhoids and the skis.
"The whole city is currently full of construction works, all of it will change to feel," says Reigo.
However, the old and tired stable building is a very attractive place where summer responses are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the director of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to a stable summer theatre with his theatre.
Although this year's theatre season with "Alexei Karenin" just ended, on 11 August, there is a railway station called "Avengering" when the old building moves around the 1980s.
"Until 11-13 August, the days of the city of Tapa, in which the open home-houses of the hospital building have been awakened, and cultural events, including the folk rally, are taking place," says Reigo, who suggests to visit the city from those days of 91 years old.
In a small yellow cabin on the hill of 1 May, there is a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very much and very much information", says Reigo to a place full of the history of the City of Tape, most of which focuses on rail and the military.
Reigo recalls that if Tapel goes through all the recommended places, the stomach will be empty soon, but luckily, the small town is full of lattes.
"We have such good places and sometimes when sitting in a coffee shop, you get the feeling that you're abroad," she describes.
Trained and young soldiers who have come to the Temple spend a lot of time in pubs and cafés, so sitting there, it's a strange feeling that you're in Estonia and in your hometown, but around you, this kind of foreign company is together.
I think it would be a great pleasure to listen to the stories of the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, moving us a lot.
In Greece, two Bulgarian Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping.
The television network quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who announced that two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
On 1 August, the police arrested a group of people who were illegal in the island of Zion, including two Bulgarians, on the island of Zion.
They were released the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry said to the television channel bTV that Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing harsh penalties on all those who are caught in a place of rest which is not intended for that purpose.
Controls continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Puppies teach wolves to kill sheep.
Since the break in Hiiuma farmers must again give the wolves "teaching material" from their herd - apparently the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a lot of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, a total of 23 sheep and injured eight, writing Hiiu Leht.
The corresponding number was only three in the previous year, 1 24 in the previous year.
In the context of the discussions, the environmental agency also has data that last year, Hiiuma was not born in the wild, and Hiiumaa's Board of Trustees was informed that there were two wolf nests fixed on the island this year.
On Monday night, the wolves broke 15 sheep in the village of Kabuna, the municipality of Emmaste, and injured 18 half of the remaining sheep.
On Wednesday morning, the wolves broke one of the sheep in Reheselja village's pasture and seriously injured another who had to be killed.
The rules for the handling of genetically modified crops must be clear.
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sends a draft law on the release of genetically modified organisms (GMOVS) and a draft legislation on the amendment of the Constitutional Law to the Constitutional Law to the co-ordination circle.
The amendment to the law waives the establishment of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) agricultural sites and operators, which will then be used as a plant health register.
The amendment of GM's agricultural operator's obligation to have a prior agreement with a person dealing with beekeeping within the prescribed limits is amended.
Although there is currently no cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, we need clear rules for the co-existence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least as long as it is not decided to declare Estonia GMOs-free," said Sigmar Suu, President of the Department of Plant Health of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"The same has to be borne in mind that the measures developed must be objective and proportionate, account being taken of the costs and administrative costs incurred by both private and public sectors," added Lui.
The draft law repeals the provisions of the GMOVS on the dataset and the training for the management of agricultural sites and operators in GM, lays down the requirements for the handling of agricultural products and for the start of economic activities of GM.
In particular with regard to beekeeping, the current obligation of the GM farmer to inform beekeepers about the start of GM cultivation is replaced by an obligation to reach an agreement with the bee before the start of cultivation with the bee.
The draft law was sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to examine this in the Bills Information System and, if they so wish, submit their opinions to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect in particular persons active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Agricultural Office.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop may be grown - MON 810 maize MON 810 maize.
Until then, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in the cultivation of GM farming.
The reason is that Estonia does not have a maize pest, a European stem product for which MON 810 is resistant to maize maize.
Also, varieties of this maize line are grown in southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climatic conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Development has commissioned studies to detect contaminations with possible GM organisms in the seeds of various suviraps, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that the seeds of rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
It can therefore be concluded that there is no conscious cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, as well as confirmation that there has been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mouriho thinks that the United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius" in the form of "genius".
Jose Mourisho believes that the United States has been recruiting Nemanja Matic in the form of a "genius" after the mid-player Sampdoria made her debut on Saturday night.
A 40 million pounds over buy-in from Chelsea began at the latest pre-season game in Dublin in the Uefa Super Cup Real Madrid before Uefa Super Cup in an initial score of 2-1 on Tuesday, with the impression that Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were safe to attack.
However, remaining away from the season-old Asia of the Blues, Maticul was in need of a match and only lasted 45 minutes, according to Mourho, he must certainly improve before the season of Premier League begins.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mind," Mourinho said.
"We will help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Ma, another recruited Victor Lindelof and Zelu Lukaku and Mourinho, who began to slowly start their season, began to place their eleven men at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho is still looking to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done "great work" by concluding contracts with three of his four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realize three out of four," he added.
"I'm even happier if they can make it happen from four to four, but they've been working hard for me."
On 1 August and this time, Muhus, the GSM broadcaster, on the other hand, got his foot on the foot.
According to Mati Martinson, a live bird observer living in the desert, the first son of a bitch was equipped with a messenger in Sõrve, and this nest is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the big sleeper in the Mullutu-Suurlah.
Because the Sõrves is not a cropland, Saarte Häl writes.
On Tuesday, it was a long time ago that one of the devils, and this one on the island of Muhu, got on the sender's side.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is, in fact, a new project carried out by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
A son of a bitch named Mati GSM was supplied last year with a GSM transmitter in Sõrves Türju.
"His actions on the Internet are all around us: how he went to Spain in the winter, coming back to Germany and Poland for a long time, and then coming to Saaremaa," Martinson spoke.
The British inventor had a British inventor put a microchip in his body to access the house and car with a handshake.
The British inventor became the first person in a country to install a microchip so that he could only open his front door with a handkerchief, access his head and even start a car.
Steven Northam, a 33-year-old, had a little chip put in between his thumb and his index finger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, consultant at the Royal Hospital of the Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Winchester, Hans, to ensure that the installation procedure is in conformity with medical standards.
The technology is similar to that of a microchip for cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The number company will also change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, asking for one lock for 300 pounds.
This married father of one child has now installed technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibition cost thousands of taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to military documents published in the press, the decision of the White House to operate a helicopter of the Navy last month for an American production event went to the South Court to pay the taxpayers about $24,000 for the South Court of Auditors.
The green and white colour Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the next meeting, had been the central number for the demonstration of American construction programmes at the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House, renewed industrial products from all 50 states during their tour.
The helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with the hunt from Maine, a fire extinguisher from Wisconsin and a forklift aid prepared in Mississippi.
According to documents from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the helicopter operator responsible for helicopter operations, the White House called for the White House's military cabinet with the participation of the helicopter's presence, FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south yard for the "unusual" event.
"I thought you would be aware of this, because this is an unusually attentionable event," said the HMX-1 commander the day before the event in e-mail to your superior, Deputy Navy officer in the field of aviation.
It was noted that the helicopter will arrive south on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the morning of 7 p.m. for an event beginning at 15 a.m. and remain there until the yard is cleaned between 18 and 21 p.m. on the same day.
It was added that if leaving the White House should be delayed, the return flight would require a second ekipah due to limitations in working time.
The initial flight crew was present at the helicopter during the event and the escort security crew remained close to the aircraft during its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to determine from the documents provided to the magazine TIME whether or not the other ekipahing was needed at first.
The Hatchi Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documentation shows that HMX-1 has been examining whether this event may be in breach of this provision.
"We asked if it was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told that it would not," wrote the commander.
"It seems you don't have a choice," replied the Deputy Chief Officer's deputy.
White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law would not cover it.
Even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform in the debate at the meeting at the time and tried to keep government regulations under control.
The use of an aircraft known as “One” or “Air Force One” for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them to travel.
Instead, the request to use them as a clean photo session is unusual.
Trump was noticed in February when his first campaign in Florida Melbourne had a background on the president's plane, and his Twitter account is falling on messages that complain about the way his predecessor used his president's plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the display of "made in the United States", which represented products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers of American materials," said the Minister of the Press of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often test the ground around Washington and the south yard to practice shooting at the President of the United States' White House with centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 sampling landings in the White House yard in the White House.
According to the official, the flight to the "prepared in the United States" event was considered to be the standard of study flights for that month.
In addition, in that day, the Escad helicopters flew for another 11 hours for "non-presidency support missions".
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of this event were in the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in the organisation of the exhibition on the southern yard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not keep the budget documents for the presidential budgets and the exact costs of the event are difficult to determine.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 annual price, the compensation rate for VH-3D is USD 24 380 per hour of flight.
The escort documents indicated, for the duration of the flight from its basic base, its fleet from Quantico airport in Virginia for 30 minutes on both sides of the route from Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is far below this amount.
"The calculation of the costs of the payers on the basis of estimates of compensation rates is very wrong," he said.
"These estimated compensation rates include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND survey, the Department of Defence’s compensation rates do not include personnel costs, but they cover fuel, maintenance and contracts costs.
Sean Spicer, a former White House press representative, was at that time defending the use of the helicopter at the event.
"The point is to show the things that America has made this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Republic of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds, if not even many people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight this."
It is not clear whether Trump was in contact with a helicopter in the south yard during the event, or not, but he sat behind the fire truck driver.
In the White House, Trump turned to Sikorsky's representatives, making a joke about company products in his personal aircraft park to media publications.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through the tears arrived at peace and joy.
In 2011, Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, 800 m running on foot ramps, and the pickup was taken off the stadium by truck.
Immediately before that, he had been defeated in the distance jump of the universe in China.
In February 2012, the EMI in February was pleased with the low-cost injury, but at the Debut Olympics in London, it received a paragraph of 6013 on 23rd.
Still, the misfortune persisted.
In 2013, after the opening day of the Estonian record, Moscow MM received a thumb injury in the Estonian distance jump on the Estonian record schedule.
Two years later, he became the 15th place in the World Cup in Beijing and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but this too was more than the disappointment he wanted for a athlete to be disappointed.
The most powerful kadallip was only passed last year by Šadeiko, unless at first a letter was sent to Amsterdam's Emil in the distance jump.
I'd just like to put together a single fair competition once in a while.
Once," confessed Shedeiko.
The worst was before: a month later, his Olympic competition was interrupted by the first obstacle due to the injury to the thighs in Rios.
The time had to be cut off - did you even continue with the seven competition?
Are two days of training worth all this?
She thought for a long time, but found peace in herself.
I had to think about it.
This experience is quite difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympia were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think about it.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pills in the bag yet," she says about her self-cleaning.
I could turn around and go forward with all my mind.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the sufferings of carelessness, but she realized that the athlete must first and foremost find out for himself.
After all, he was so grounded on all sides.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said that he would not give up, and he wanted to prove himself what he was worth," says Mägi.
There's some kind of peace in him now.
He's doing this for his own good.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set 6280 points for the new Estonian record in Götzise's multi-competition.
In a high-level competition, he improved the personal peak in the gunfire by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran into a record-time obstacle.
Then the multi-competitor felt that it was not the ceiling of the ability, but that it was erased as only the primary doubt.
Mägi, who has been following him for years, says that Šadeiko is a musician.
He's an athlete, he's good at training.
If something's wrong or wrong, he'll say it right away.
He knows his own body and trusts his own knowledge.
That's what we need to start with.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
Shedek has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind of person who's doing a workout," he says, and says, "the most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also provides a good result.
The baby happiness of loved ones makes you happy.
Good feelings have also been given to Šadeiko by the happiness of those close to him.
Her former workmate Maris Mägi and Sister Grete have recently become parents, and the multi-competitor has received support from new weathermen.
"It's been very interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol whose drinking is equal to the brain's "tretting" of the brain.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes - the wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a scientist at Yale University.
In his words, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" taste of wine.
Snooping glass, whipping water in the mouth, enjoying it and experiencing aftertaste, we make our brains work to create a taste of wine.
Sheperd said that wine molecules do not actually contain flavour, but taste comes from the way wine stimulates the brain.
He provides a comparison of how the brain "sees" the colors of the brain.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates a taste of wine," Sheperd says.
The things that still affect the formation of wine flavours are, for example, our age, gender, and even the amount of spit that a person produces.
Sheperd, of course, tells me that wine is not just to get drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take too much sip, the system will be oversaturated.
Too much drinking can harm your brain instead of harming your brain - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three drinks of wine, loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced spiritual ability are at risk.
10% of the employees in the ICT sector in the ICT sector receive less earnings than their parents.
In the font of the personnel search firm, data reveal that 10% of the employees in the ICT sector in Estonia receive less pay than their colleagues.
Ten percent pay gap between men and women, writes the portal in Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the R & D activities of the entire ICT sector.
The total number of posts was under 8 577.
63% of the posts were employed by staff.
"Although only 3 companies acknowledged that the pay gap was in the male favor and the rest of the companies considered that there was no pay gap, the average wage per month for the same work is on average 10% higher than that for women and on average 8% higher than that for men per year," said Ilmar Pääla, an analysis of Fontes.
"Narcose" season three commercial clip: now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Netflix hit series will enter the central location of Cali's map.
Despite the fact that the killer of Pablo Escobar was exposed in the second season of "Narcose", the series of Netflix has not come to an end for long.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the flow services and the first one has already been made up of a commercial clip that makes a series of new enchantments.
In the third season, the DEA will pay attention to the world's richest drug business organisation - the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful crosses, such as the Fortum 500 companies, simply by means of more bribed government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is a cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) is the head of the cartel, and is a member of the new U.S., of the family.
The recently released commercial video shows Pedro Pascal coming back as Javier Penna, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement to assist the war against the leaders in the war.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcose" will be on the 1st of September.
According to the UN, the role of Afghan democracy in politics depends on the role of women in democracy.
The Head of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesdays that elections can represent the people only if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Mr. Nicholas Haysom, Head of United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are candidates in the local Soviet elections, three women are candidates for Vice-Presidentship and more than 30 of the voters who have recently registered are women.
"The emphasis on the importance of women's role cannot be exaggerated," he said in the statement he had made on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women are fully involved and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has failed, for its part, a electoral process that coincides with a transitional period when the role of international military operations becomes open to agreement.
This year's elections will mark the first time that power will be given calmly from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, women have a strong role to play in the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Regional Electoral Commission, 1.2 million women out of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

From the Philippines to the world of the world, or the Ulgkot trip to the heart of mossies.
The oiled bags are summer classics, which have become a product of their own in recent years, which, in fact, must be hung at the end of the hand by one of the correct summer speakers and which, despite its modest origin, has been known by traders to weld an additional price label for the hit.
The heeled bag is probably one of the things that has existed every single time in life and whose ownership has not created any special emotions.
It's just real, and if it isn't, there's nothing broken.
Now, however, shoulder bags are making a real race, and fashion fans have changed their fine designs for the summer months to easily translate bags.
This is not only a bag, but it is so popular today as a street bag, and brave women even walk into it.
However, it is worth explaining here first whether a summer loop like this still sits or if it is worth putting wet and laptops into a slightly more formal amount.
Variety has turned shoulder bags into a true love of women in summer.
For example, when reading foreign fashion models, the first thing you'll notice is that on a trip, the fashionies will visit the local market as the first thing they'll do on a trip and buy themselves a shoulder bag, which is then true of the entire holiday time and which goes along with the beach, the market and also with the girlfriends in the city.
Some of them are so generous that they buy a bag bigger and sell or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that among the readers, demand for bags is so high that in the real world women (and men!) are likely to go hand in hand with each other in order to become a happy owner of some of the bags.
In some senses, such madness is also understandable, because rare times are these times when in the fashion world some of the things that have risen into a hit position can be bought for a few euros.
True, smart merchants have also discovered a simple change of money in this regard, and thus the thinner luxury brands also call straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Obviously, it should not be for the poorest clients to feel like mere mortals who are promoting around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to purchase a shoulder bag with a price of over EUR 1 000 for Dolce & Gabbaa.
However, the translation of the bell’s translation bag can be used for 6000 Euros.
Unlike most of the Mohits, however, shoulder bags do not come from some great fashionable ones, but their story began far from the beginning.
The name shoulder bags allegedly come from far away from the Philippines, where they have been blown away.
The fluttering of the heel bag is there, in particular, where it is not often seen by the exporium and the locals.
It is said that it comes from the 14th century B.C.E. and is quite similar to the normal basket drop.
However, since the shoulder bag does not need to be broken as hard as a basket, they can be fitted with patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and thus more effective.
For example, recently, there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather strips in them.
In particular, shoulder bags may be sent to actress Jane Birkin, the largest of which had not been foreseen for the most brute shoulder bags.
In fact, he matched the shoulder bag with all kinds of outfits and did not even have to go to the Cannes Film Festival in this way.
The popularity of bags today does not mean much, but the fact that taking care of them is the head of the head and, unlike any other sumaan, they need not be maintained by special means, but also by water and wet towels.
As in the case of retailing, since classical appearance, brands have emerged with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you may be able to buy a strawed rib top or a tiny shoulder oatmeal.
However, it is worth noting that the classic shoulder bag never goes out of style, but shoulder by shoulder.
But what about the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries now, a bag of classic translations of this kind, which resembles its style of basket, has been open and has been short, as well as straws, straps and strings, has been used as a classic for centuries.

A man who disappeared in the wilderness three days ago was found dead.
The treasure left her home on Wednesday night in Kärla's suburbs in the unknown direction.
There was a phone call on the way to the last contact last night, Friday night, and the phone positioning gave the man a place to be located in Lääne-Saare, a village in Mõnnuse, where he was sought with a helicopter until midnight and early morning with dogs.
Then his cell phone became empty and his location could not be determined.
He kept looking for him this morning.
Thank you to all those who contributed to finding the Treasure.
GBB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant.
The association expects McVitie's CEO to confirm the long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant of the company.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has silenced the Tollcross object's investment in the future.
In a factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies are produced, as well as other products, more than 500 people work.
The owner of McVitie's company, Pladis, said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years.
More employees and trade union presidents were hired to "are the first to hear" when something changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter addressed to the owner of the company, GMB Scotland asked McVitie's company "to express concerns about the fact that funding is not used to modernise production lines".
Drew Duffy, GMB Senior Organizer, said: "The fact that we are not getting the object's chief manager's clarity about Tollcross's business needs and the investment plan for the future makes our members deeply concerned.
There have been a number of generations of families working here, and the workforce consists of a large number of local communities and the people of the Glasgow community, making it essential to promote decent employment in an area where there is high unemployment and social exclusion.
Glasgow therefore needs, in terms of employment, wages and well-being in the eastern part of the world, and in the light of the increase in the cost of living and the chronic decline in production of Brexit, a highly growing company in McVitie."
The representative of the poster said: "The object of the Customs Cross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company responds directly to it because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
A couple of months ago, a regular meeting was held between the Tollcrossi employees and the representatives of GMB, where a number of issues were obviously discussed.
So we discussed with our employees that, like all other businesses operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our companies and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than GBP 5 million in Tollcross, most of which has gone into production lines and to improve operations.
We fully understand Tollcross as the heritage of the site and if any change in the activity of the object is to occur, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about the approach to Neymar?
Laga may regret her interest in Marco Verrati.
The Paris Saint-Germain will not give up its attempt to lure Neymar into their ranks by offering him a $189 million supply to buy out. But did they warn Russia three years ago about this record conquest trip?
This murky approach has opened the summer transition window, and the Ligue 1 Club is ready to crush more than twice the current world record of buying-in, which was set up last season after Paul Pogba returned to the United States for £89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will result in Neymar becoming the world's most expensive player and, above all, the most paid professional athlete in the world, who will receive more than 500 000 pounds per week from PSG after payment.
The city is obviously angry at both the approach and the break-in of Neymar, even though the close source to the Catalan board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the footballer since his arrival at Santo in 2013.
But did the President of the PSG warn the football world about such a chance three years ago?
When the City showed an interest in the contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaf harshly warned all clubs that are thinking about recruiting one of the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll step up against them and contact their players," said Al-Khelaf.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with any of our players, they have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have stepped across this border because the Spanish Club has previously shown interest in PSG's mid-player Marco Verratt this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave on any condition and that Barcelona could be struck back as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in Neymar form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges, not borders, after Brexit.
"Brexi is seriously threatened by a whirlwind between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," warned Varadkar at his first visit to Northern Ireland after his appointment in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made it possible for the free movement of current people and goods, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not boundaries," he stressed.
As early as he said, he would prefer to remain part of the European Union, and since this is not possible, he would prefer to remain part of the European common market.
This would preserve the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to change the exit of the United Kingdom would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained the Prime Minister of Ireland.
Noteing that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: "We could certainly have such an agreement with the United Kingdom."
An alternative would be to return to customs points that would announce historical fragmentation and failure.
"The key to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of the everyday life of Northern Ireland.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
Märt Foundation: Ironman is able to pass through each one of its first half-long triathlons.
In the winter capital of Otepä, the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics was held today, while the semi-long Ironman competition took place around a thousand triathletes from over thirty countries.
70,3 miles of distance consisted of 1.9 km of swim, 90 km of bicycles and 21,1 km of bicycles.
Among others, the first triathlon of his life was also defeated by Märt Association.
"I thought it would turn out to be complicated and eventually it was complicated," said the Foundation's finish.
Despite the complexity, the Foundation found that, in fact, the triathlon is a forceful head of everything.
"It's not the distance that kills, it's the tempo that kills," he said, hinting that at the right pace it will reach the finish of each head.
Except for Sepp: "It's okay to have physical activity, but unfortunately it can't swim."
The municipality had been working hard since February.
At the beginning of 4-5 hours a week, and later, at the end of the week, ten hours a week.
