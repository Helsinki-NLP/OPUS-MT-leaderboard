A 9-year-old boy was found on the street running away.
The police have had a search warrant for a 9-year-old boy's escape on Tuesday night.
The disappearance notification of a boy leaving the West Tampere with his friend has spread through social media.
According to the police department, the boy has been contacted, and he has no risk of life and health.
The son's father told the Evening Sannom half-night that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start some ex-post reviews.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, once again in terror - tears apart paint in Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paints in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to work in the Masters League as well.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristian Ronaldo from the League of Masters nationalities turned at least for a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid Ronaldo was the only one who moved to the top of the goal-makers' list when he shot a visitor on the Nahtar Donetski network from two hits of penalty kicks and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his ground level to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess, which was flat with him, has 77 hits together.
Real won a match of 4-0.
The story has been over in the Italian football league in Serie A since the beginning, but in the Champions' League in D, it started with a 2-1 guest victory over the city.
The victory was done by the rich ten minutes before the end of the Juventus Alvaro Mora.
The attacks on the city bore the absence of knee-jerk Sergei Aguero in the absence of knee-jerk Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend’s dial game, came into the field only with the last ten years of news.
The second United States association also experienced hardship in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering the 1-2 loss.
The ManU's 20-year-old foreign defence firm Luke Shaw's visit was due to last only 15 minutes.
The dangerously-looking slider cladding of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the ManU package that was attacked towards the paint so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven’s home stadium for a century before medical staff went to see him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in 41th minutes to a 1-0 wire, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreo flattered before taking a break with an increase in time.
In the second half of the period, Luciano Narsingh made the PSV's net profit.
In the season of painting, the Champions League started A-block Paris Saint-Germain.
The issue was that of an Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who changed his US shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and lifted the ball past the back of Malmö's goaltender Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made PSG 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
PSG has been bet on the season's performances.
The default is not wrong, but Malmö, which is part of too long Euros, is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the star of PSG, first met Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team lost the Moscow TsSKA at the B-block match in Germany to Queensland 0-1.
The opposition appealed immediately to resign - the President gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Mr. Robert Mugabe, has once again given the same speech he gave at the end of last month in Parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, an 91-year-old, was in the full spirit of Mugabe.
The MDC, the chief opposition party, called on Mugabe to resign from his duties because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that confusion had happened only in Mugabe's office and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech previously and now China's impact on the country's economy has been addressed by China.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis.
Germany and Austria have proposed the next few additional EU leaders summits due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council following the summit, will evaluate the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how more effective registration could be obtained in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the internal ministers' table.
The Professor said in an emergency call that he shot his wife.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked for a voice in an emergency call to shake the police home a little bit and told them that he had shot his girlfriend.
In particular, he noted that their own mother was present and alive and probably afraid. The professor told us that the contact information of a dead woman's family would be on the phone.
In the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and on white paper a message written in hand: "I am very sorry and hope that I could reverse what I did. I loved her, and she is the only woman who ever loved me", in a letter signed by Lamb, read according to the authorities.
There was no indication in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University, Mississippi in Cleveland, had already gone 500 kilometers to the school campus.
Lynn Buford, Chief of Police of Delta State University, noted that the university authority received information about shooting at 10.18 a.m.
According to him, Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while after this.
There was another death in the day, and I took the spirit of myself when the police caught him.
The next day after the ammo, students and teaching staff kept their eyes shut behind closed doors, and the authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motive.
The researchers studied details in both places, and the Lamb-knowing teachers told us about the man, and the researchers had a picture of a rich but probably problematic teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor's hours.
According to the Gautier police of the district of Prentiss, the professor had no history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, on the other hand, had mentioned in his book, which was written by the Lamb, which had given a confession to the "loving people" with which he was able to spend an academic life.
Both work at the Social Science and History Institute, which had 17 staff members, and many of the students attended the courses of both men.
However, references to problems were raised.
Professor Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamba, said that the professor seemed agitated and nervous, "as if he had something wrong.
Another student named Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him at the end of the academic year 2014-2015 that he was under stress.
In the past, Lamb had asked Delta State University for medical leave because of some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two current rates.
Recent changes in university remuneration policy meant that the argument for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
University Director William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lamb was in trouble.
These questions cannot be answered.
After leaving the campaign, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Paris.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life off with a 38-caliber gun in the backyard of Mississippi in the United States, about a mile from the home of his parents, Methel Johnson, the M.O.D. of Washington County, told me.
The Lamb car was still in the driveway.
The police did not immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told the police that he believed that the man had known the people of the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb started her work as a head of Science and Education at a university with 3 500 students. In 2009, there were 12,000 people in the city .
In the spring, he received a doctorate in education.
One of Lamb's latest friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me that he met with Lamb's mutual friends when he was 15 and 20 years old.
He was still in high school, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who spent years trying to teach Hairston guitar play.
"The pond was at that time a real heartbreaker.
All the girls were on his side," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
The Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but according to any document, they were not engaged.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river house in the small town of Gautier.
The cop said the dog was okay.
Prentiss's former husband, Shawn O'Sten, told me that he had resigned from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had stayed together and had a daughter who is now 19.
"He was quite upset," O'Sten said about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Sten had never met Lamb but heard from Abigail, his daughter, that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail both appeared in the summer event three years ago.
Later, they called together at times, too.
According to O'Sten, his name is to write and play his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and a part-time entertainment director at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside of Gautier, reported that he had seen Lamb and Prentiss on 5 September after Lamb had called guitar and lipstick for a limited audience.
There was nothing to explain that something was wrong with it.
"Happy couple", Shaffer said.
"We slept together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who had died, hosted the first year's seminars and had specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times," said Professor Don Allan Mitchell of England.
She was married, and she had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was the chairman of his own brotherhood and University.
There are 900 people gathered at the Delta State University Congress in Cleveland at a memorial event in candlelight, including staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife, Liz and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended a night event where the choir of the university presented the songs "Bright Printing Star" and "Amazing?"
Education starts on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get the students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Audrey and Rogeio Solis report Mississippi in Cleveland.
Auxiliaries: Associated Press editors Emily Wagner fraud in the Mississippi in Yville and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police are telling us now that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was also made clear that even though Lamb referred in an emergency call to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to employ less seasonal workers.
Toys R Us is not going to hire as much seasonal workers as last year. However, the dealer of toys and baby products tells us that he is offering existing workers and seasonal workers the opportunity to work more hours.
The company intends to hire 40,000 people to shop and distribution centres throughout the country, which in 2014 hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the new employees will start in October to December.
Although months have passed, the trade season is approaching at a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers for shops and the dispatch and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the return to the future film was a significant moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
The first night also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the arrival of the royals, and I noticed that there was no place next to me, and I found out that Princess Diana was coming next to me," Fox told me that she was coming in the trailer of the Back in Time document.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to the date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document is related to the Return to the Future films, and the document interviews in addition to Fox, Lea Thompson and Christher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future movie received its first night 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely a time travel film of all time for me," Spielberg stated.
Back in Time will be published in VO and DVD format and will be presented in the selected cinemas starting in October.
UN Secretary-General: no military solution in Syria.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon commented on Russia's enhanced military efforts and notes that almost five years of conflict does not have a military solution and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to join forces and support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban reported on its intention to meet five permanent member states of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria.
Ban regretted the fact that the divisions between the Security Council, the Syrian people and the States have caused a situation which is impossible to resolve.
In the context of the Syrian crisis, Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the same kind of solidarity and unity that reached the Iranian Treaty in the context of the Syrian crisis.
Chapter 8 of support questionnaires: Is Donald Trump serious?
The best ones have been tried to stamp an empty talker.
He's also sick in the head.
Some can predict the collapse of the Trump.
In the Republics, (to date) results have been sought by all means to draw Trump from the Gaul Command.
Ten out of the eleven national galleys show Donald Trump two-digit support numbers, some of which are seriously considering what it actually says about the conditions for the real estate mole.
The elections are, of course, just in the beginning.
It has not yet been announced that Trump will be elected candidates for the Republican Republics.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was able to give space to the incoming Herman Cain.
For several reasons, a just person would have a common public election for several reasons.
External groupings, such as Jeb Bushi Super Pac and the Economic Conservative Club for Growth have taken note of the strong position of Trump and began to dig his cock for his fall.
The following recent gallup data show that the property mogul cannot be ignored by means of an adjustment:
There's been a complete twist in the position of the right position.
Just as Trump said he was going to stand as a candidate in mid-June, according to the Gallup of the University of Monmouth, only ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogus.
By mid-July, 40% had a positive image.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding proportion was 52 per cent.
Now six out of the ten Republics have a positive image of Donald Win.
About three out of ten, the image is negative.
These figures also hold in the states where elections are held first.
In last week's Vinni Market Gallup, 60 per cent of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two out of three Republicans would be pleased with the nomination of the Trump.
In the CNN and ORC gallup last year 67% of Republicans said that they were very pleased or satisfied with the possibility of selecting Trump as candidates.
Only two out of ten would be very dissatisfied with the Righter's nomination.
Ben Carson is almost as eager to receive TM (43% would be very pleased with Carson's nomination and 40% of the Final's nomination).
Who is the next most popular candidate?
The third is Marco Rubio, which accounts for 21% of the contribution.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republics would be dissatisfied or extremely dissatisfied if Jeb Bush were elected as a candidate for the party.
The majority of the Republics do not consider the Prompi segment to be problematic.
Donald Trumpi has been widely criticised for its overwhelming and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of a real estate mobile to be appropriate to the President. The views are reflected in the opinion of the ABC News and the Washington Post.
The same is true of Iowa, where the first meeting is held: 52% of Republicans believe that Trump's personal properties are acceptable to the Chief Defence Officer.
However, according to ABC and Post, 44% believe that Trump is incapable of operating effectively and that ten out of ten consider the Trump temperament to be incompatible with the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take the Winm seriously.
When the Republicans ask who is most likely to be chosen as a party candidate, according to CNN and ORC gallup, four out of ten believe Trump's chances.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of 10 people would have spent their money on behalf of Jeb Bush.
Ally: Republics have never had a very reliable circular before.
In the last four out of ten Republics in the last election, Rick Perry was likely to be a candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romene.
The majority seems to consider the Tõmp campaign as convincing.
Even if the Republics support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
A member of the expert considers that a split camp is likely to benefit more than that when the opponents of the Trump are divided into different candidates.
Monmouth University's opinion at the beginning of September revealed that in an imaginary double fight between Trump and almost anyone else in the Republic, Trump would almost always receive a larger support crowd.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubioto by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichia and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's still standing still.
Is Cruz Trump's only true opponent?
Ben Carson would win a 19-point difference from the Trump in an imaginary double fight.
A narrow majority of the supporters of the Trump say that they have already taken a vote.
According to the gallulpi published by CBS and NYY on Tuesday, fair half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation may change for a number of reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of the best-favoured players have not made a final decision.
A more competitive competitor at the moment is a neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who have already chosen their candidates are twice as likely to vote for the better.
Six out of the ten Republics will agree with the finalist view of the migration.
Following Donald Trump's invitation to the campaign, migration to be rapists from Mexico two months ago has been a hot issue for 2016.
Part of the concern is that the powerful talks of the Trump banish the important Latin American voters from the Republican groups and hinder the renewal of the brand.
However, according to the findings of the ABC News and the Washington Post on Monday, six out of ten Republicans are still on migration issues on the same lines as Trump.
As long as migration is in the light, Donald Trump is also in the room.
Dissatisfaction with governance is at its top.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republicans' votes in total.
According to the latest opinion of ABC News and Washington Post, this was the opinion of six out of ten Republicans.
These two candidates are also agitated to the U.S.C.
According to the opinion of Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the activities of the Republicans in Brussels: 54% are dissatisfied and 21% on the brink."
Jeremy Corbyn debuted the Prime Minister at Question Time.
After the election, the first appearance of Corbyn at the Prime Minister's Question Time is looking forward to being welcomed.
The new film of the Labour Force Labour's new film Jeremy Corbyn is due to rise for the first time not to force David Cameron at Question Time later.
Corbyn asks for the first six questions shortly after noon. The media and the representatives of the working party will follow him closely.
Corby has called for less theater and more fact for a weekly stand.
He has also found that he can skip part-sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
Corby's leadership will be weighed for the first time in connection with the meeting. Corby will be subjected to a parliamentary test now after the talk of the consensual government assembly and of the Corby's TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
The decision to discuss the Labour film at the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday has been criticised by a number of Tory party representatives. The silence has also ended at the headlines of several newspapers.
The silence of Corbyn during national singing attracted attention to the silence of Corbyn.
Mr Corbyn's representative noted the status of Corbyn during the national assembly, with due respect for the vote on the Sanctuary of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr Smith, a member of the Corby's Presiding Board of Directors, told the BBC in the Two's Newsnight programme that he would have invited the party president to come together in spite of the opposition to this Monarchy in the National Dialogue.
The Ten-Secretary has refused to enter Corbyn's singles, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs. Less than a sixth party of the party originally supported Corbyn's choice of direction.
Robin Brant, the correspondent for BBC policy, considers that political differences between the UK EU membership and the conditions under which the government will grant the benefits have accumulated in the working party since the appointment of Corbyn.
At the meeting of the TUC, Corbyn explained that Labour intends to propose amendments to remove the restrictions completely.
Hours later, Minister of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government Smith stated that the party's position was very clear: it only resists government plans to lower the limit of 26,000 to 23,000 pounds.
Corby is the fifth Director-General of Labour, who David Cameron has been facing over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The President of Labour, who promised a new approach to politics, says that he has chosen the public to present to Cameron on 30 000 proposals to the public.
According to Corbyn, who was elected from the Islington North Electoral, there are too many clashes at Question Time, and he promises to avoid clever interpretation and promising and, instead, to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Corby has found that Minister of Defense Angela Eagle has been following him on Question Time, especially when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also cast the idea that others may also be able to speak at times, and he will talk about this with John Bercow, President of Parliament's House.
Upon Corbyn's rise to the party leadership in 2005, Cameron stated that he wanted a doll-the-art policy, which is often linked to the polls, but some years later he found himself to have failed in his goal.
Since Question Time was first broadcast in 1990, it has been considered to be the main indicator of the management's judgment, underroom management and position, but according to the criticisms, Question Time has become a caricature that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers from youngsters to photographers.
The center of Johannesburg is a dangerous environment for homeless people.
A wise way of learning and making money has been found for the group of former Catholics.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit description studio that teaches homeless youngsters to photograph their home area and deserve it at the same time.
The BBC News met a young person who has completed the project among the first among them.

Wearing wet strength as the UK wage rises in the UK.
Punta strengthened as wages rose in Great Britain, and SABMiller pulled FTSE 100 into an increase in FTSE.
In May to July, wages in Great Britain rose by 2.9 per cent from the corresponding period last year. Bonuses were not included.
The faster than forecasted growth was the fastest since 2009.
The pound increased by 1 % and the rate was quoted at $1,555. The pound was also confirmed in proportion to the euro and quoted at EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.99 per cent and reached 6,229.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose exchange rate was 20% lower when the company received a preliminary offer from AB InBev, the competitor.
When it came to effect, the trade would unite the world’s two largest brewing companies and bring brands under the same roof, including Budweiser, Stella Arto, Peron and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9% in the old water of the competitive Richemont Group's positive result, which concentrated on luxury products.
Richemont's latest sales figures are better than forecast. The development of sales was also a consequence of the development of Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share rose by 5 per cent of the miner's announced intentions to raise the stock by $2.2 billion as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Product and Paper Corporation The share of the coin was the largest drop in 4,3 % at the expense of Goldman Sachs's drop in the company's share price for sale.
JD Sport's price rose by 3.1 per cent after the sports company announced that its return before taxes would increase by 83 per cent to GBP 46.6 million.
JD Sports: higher wage costs could be detrimental to enlargement.
According to Peter Cowgill, Chairman of JD Sports' Board of Directors, raising the minimum wage in the United Kingdom would increase purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover higher labour costs for the company.
According to Cowgill, an increase in labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' expansion plans and reduce the need for additional labour.
Metcash launches the lawnmower campaign against Aldi's belt.
Metcash is trying to secure its IGA store from Aldi's power in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a wholesaler of food products, has launched a grass-root campaign to preserve the market share of IGA retails in South and West Australia against Aldi's $700 million invasion of Australia.
Aldi is planning to establish two distribution centres and up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands in marketing in mainstream communications and social media, and organise events such as the Adelaide Show.
For example, the ice-cream factory Simmo in Dunsborough offers corn in IGA stores, and traders sell tickets to stock customers at discount prices for games from the South Australian Fleet League.
Metcashin is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade association will organise an annual investment strategy date.
This is an important market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30 % of the footprint of Metcashin IGA stores, and in these regions coverage is higher than in the IGA retail network of the eastern states.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their neighbourhood, and IGA traders have a much higher market share in the region than in NSW, Hong Kong and Queensland. South Australia has a 30 % market share and West Australia has a 24 % market share, while Eastern states only account for 14 %.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley, for example, believe that Aldi will capture 5% of the market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores. The chain will eat sales from all operators, but especially from independent operators.
This week, Dr. Morgan Stanley's analyst, Tom Kierath, estimated that IGA dealers could be sold at 360 million and Metcashi would be sold at 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach 500 million dollars and 600 million dollars in these areas.
Metcashin's fixed costs are high, so the loss of food sales and sales may result in a loss of $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Kierath states.
At the same time Metca is losing market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although according to a recent study by Roy Morgan, IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan believes that Metcashin's food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018. Its market share would fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% by 2020.
Last week, the chief portfolio manager of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglas, told at the event organised in Melbourne that it is highly likely that Metcash will disappear in all ten years.
Metcash has refused to make a public statement to Douglas' comments.
It is understandable that Metcashin's member of the Board of Directors contacted Douglas last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcashin’s food business has decreased by 43% from 2012 levels, reflecting a reduction in the cost of financing for the pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler will act in response and make more than $150 million a year for the annual harvest of the Australian dollar for hundreds of products per week for Coles and Woolworths. The chain would like to support traders in re-establishing their stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh goods and improve the food mix of their own brands.
According to Metcashin's CEO, Ian Morrice, price revisions and stock restructuring plans are on track, and the company is able to raise its profits for the first time in 2017 for four years.
Spring Healy, President of the Council of Australia, defends the Kokkinaki of the Sunasi Kokkinaki.
The Chanasi Kokkinakis deserves its behavior instead of special mentioning criticisms.
According to the Australian Tenors’ President, Steve Healy, the Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side-by-side victim of the recent Nick Kyrgos-related stuff, which deserves special mention instead of criticism.
The older half of a twin named "special K" called "special K", Kokkinakis was hit by an unfavorable light when the evil boy Kyrgios provoked his opponent at the ATP tournament in St. Wawrika, U.S.A.
Shortly after this, during the fight between Kokkinnakis and Ryan Harrison, the judge had to try to separate the competitors from each other. "Wawrink should have given his back to the Kyrgyz and my friend," Harrison said.
In the open US, Kokkinakis struck with shock in the field of the bat, when his match was ruined by the big crackers. Healy has faithfully defended Kokkinakis.
At present, the teenage star is in Glasgow, where he and Sam Groth are fighting for the second game player behind Bernard Toci at the Cup semifinal against Great Britain.
"I strongly believe that your Suna is drawn to the dispute", Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the US open, and he is certainly not the first player to break his mail because of his frustration. I know Thanas so well that he is not proud of what he has done.
However, he has endured very well, for example, the provocative use of Harrison in the open United States, and I think he deserves recognition.
He's got a strong team and a great family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He is very mature at the age of 19, he works hard and completes a very team. He has never had problems with other players and is being held among players. He is practicing hard, is in good condition and is a truly stable and mature young man. I think he should be judged on the basis of his own seaside."
Healy also decided to drop the important round of support from the Kyrgios Australia team, starting in periphery. Healy describes the solution to a joint decision that would be effective for all parties. However, he supports the return of the Canberra breeder to the team for the long-term approval of the team.
First of all, we want to focus entirely on the prices associated with Kyrgyz, instead of anything else," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top as quickly as possible, as Federer and Murray have observed, the young man must grow up in the light of the public, who deserves his criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are continuing to support him in order to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to provide him with his own peace. I believe that it is best for the whole team and for Nick.”
European migration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants.
An emergency has been reported by Hungary to close its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and to catch illegal migrants, who were intended to prevent the flow of migration.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered in no country, and the Serbian authorities reacted fiercely.
People who forced violence were forced to remain on the road between national checkpoints for an indefinite period of time.
The collapse began to rise to the surface.
In the air of the police helicopter, over the migrants, these people were saying, "Open the border!" and calling out insults to the Hungarian riot police.
He took part in protesting against the eating and drinking strike.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it would not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbi wants to be part of the solution, no more damage.
The situation needs to be discussed in Brussels and in other countries soon", Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The death at the border between Hungary and Serbia began a day later, when the 28-state group failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40 000 floods of asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is common. At the meeting, there was a hope that an agreement would be reached next month or by the end of the year on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary, would receive from the EU Member States.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria convened an extraordinary summit for the next week in order to discuss the crisis on the continent of immigrants.
However, Hungary did not hope for urgent action in Brussels or in the neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency situation developed so that in the two southern regions the authorities were able to use more effective means of shutting you down and speeding up legal processes in the field of asylum.
At the same time, Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Szijjarto noted that Hungary is also planning a barbed wire fence to the Romanian border in order to prevent the flow of migration from the point of view now that the Serbian border is already ready to use a fence.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners took part in the tender for the finalisation of wire ropes between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and a point of transit for migrants to the European Union. Many of these migrants are refugees from Syria and from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban claimed that the majority of incoming people are living refugees, not war refugees who have the right to asylum.
According to the new law that entered into force in halftime, it is a crime to cross or damage a barbed wire fence four metres high, built by the government on the southern border towards Serbia. The law also defines longer prisoners for convicted human traffickers.
"In view of the situation created by immigration, the government is declaring a crisis in the country," said Zoltan Kovac, a government official, informing journalists in the south of the country in Szeged.
"Let's get a tight line: illegal border crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to adopt the military measures expected next week. The suppliers of the Associated Press office at the border have for several days seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs.
Gyorgy Bakógi, internal security advisor of Orban, told me that the authorities have captured 45 border crossings to try immediately at the border and 15 further.
People crossing the border who have been helped are now under police control, accused of crimes under new laws.
The authorities are quick to repair the fence by correcting it by the authorities.
In addition, two of the two border crossing points on the Serbian border were closed by the Hungarian authorities on Tuesday. One border crossing point was closed by means of a train covered with a cross-border link.
Chaos took over the main border crossing point near Roske, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small metal container point of contact where people packed in.
About 20 came in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of immigrants blocked the main street that connects Serbia and Hungary. People reported themselves in a drinking and eating strike until they are released into Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership over Bernie Sanders, side by side, according to the national gallul plating.
The support rate for former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton is still two-digit in the race for the national presidential candidate of the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the distance.
Clinton's support now stands for 47% of the votes cast by the democratics (from 58%) while Sanders is on the other side with 27% (from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure into the presidential race, and his support for the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the pre-elections for most Democrats, it is too early to tell the candidates who they support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more sure of their choice than other candidates' supporters.
Since the Gallup in CBS News last month, Clinton has lost support of several democratic groups, while new supporters have been involved in Sanders camp.
Clinton still has strong leadership among the general public and moderate, but the leadership has narrowed down.
Clinton's support for men has fallen significantly and has only a 5% roll in relation to Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership over demos under the age of 50, and he is now level with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among the older voters.
Last month Clinton's advantage over Sanders was two-digit among the liberals, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points of neck to Clinton in this group.
About half of the Democrats would be happy to support Clinton if he was elected as a candidate for the party.
The fourth would support Clinton with a small reserve, and 15% would support him just because he's the candidate.
Six per cent would not support Clinton.
It is no surprise that Clinton's current supporters would be particularly enthusiastic supporters, even if elected as candidates.
There is more in the minds of those who are currently not in favour of Clinton, only about a quarter would be eager to support him.
Only 35% of all Republican voters would eagerly support the most popular Republican candidate Donald Trump.
While Clinton's voters are asked to be free to describe why they are in favour of his application, the most popular argument is Clinton's right performance (16%) and the second most popular answer is that it is time to choose the President-in-Office (13%) and, thirdly, that Clinton is the best candidate for 10%.
Clinton's supporters also called for his contact with Bill Clinton (9 %).
In addition, common views and opportunities are mentioned for real elections.
The Vice-President was still looking for a potential candidate, and 57% of the democratic voters would like him to join the race, and secondly, he would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When I ask the voters about the second most popular candidates for the party, most of them choose Biden.
Over half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate after Clinton and much more popular with Sanders.
If Biden does not go to the democratic candidate race, Hillary Clinton will increase its edge over Sanders. In the case of Sanders, the lead is 20 percentage points and will increase to 30 percentage points if Sanders don't go to the race.
55% of the democratics consider Clinton to be a candidate, who has the best chance of winning the real elections, but this share has decreased from 78% last month.
The Biden on the second floor is far from Clinton, but more people believe that Biden's chances of winning the real election will prevail.
However, democratic voters attach greater importance to the chances of winning candidates on issues.
The voters do not consider it impossible to accept a constitutional or possible candidate to accept anyone.
The voters consider democratic candidates or potential candidates to be appropriate in their nature.
Most people think Clintoni, Sanders and Biden are honest, reliable and representative types.
Biden is often described as being honest, whereas Clinton is often considered a leader type.
Up to 30% of the democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, and 15% of Sanders do not know. 27% do not know whether Sanders are honest.
Democratists believe that the views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden are close to the ideology of voters' own ideology.
About a quarter of all the features have no opinion on Sanders.
When the voters are asked for views on the use of Hillary Clinton's private email and its own home as a foreign minister, the majority of the voters are pleased with Clinton's explanation and have not changed the views of these voters on Clinton.
There is a difference between the general public and the general public.
Half the Americans are dissatisfied with Clinton's report, and only a third is satisfied.
Public opinion was held in March, when the conflict had just become public.
The majority of the Americans believe that the controversial use of e-mail has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36% say that the image has changed in the wrong direction.
The majority of this 36%, of six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party think Clinton is honest and reliable, these qualities can be improved by asking for the views of all the voters: Clinton considers only 32% fair and reliable, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
Of all the voters, 62% do not think Clinton is fair and reliable.
On the other hand, 55 per cent of all voters in the whole country do not think the Truth is fair and reliable either.
However, Clinton and Trump both get good grades from leadership.
Six of the candidates involved in this event, Biden, Carson and Bush were considered to be the most reliable candidate.
The majority considers Sanders to be honest, but, as with Carson, many people have no Sanders opinion.
The sample of the survey is 351 voters and the error margin of the questionnaire is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson will visit you on Donald Trump's way back to the national support survey.
According to CBS News and New York Times' latest support poll, Ben Carson has reached Donald Trumpic.
These two candidates reached more than half of the votes in the new loop, leaving other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters of the whole country, Trump still has strong support. Support has risen from 23% of the CBS survey conducted before the debate held last month in Fox News. According to a survey published on Tuesday, the support rate is 27%.
However, Carson's support would allow a massive increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has strong support for all the population groups, and in a group of highly educated people, he almost beat Trump.
Other candidates except Cary Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich will remain far away. The support of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is weak and has dropped from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida divided the third rank with 6% support.
Error 376 of the Republican retaliator's sample is 6% in the direction or the other. The questionnaire was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published last year by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is rising, supporting 19% of Republicans while the support of Trump is 32%.
In the latest survey of ABC News and Washington Post, Trump was also well-introduced in front of Carson.
At last week's men's encounter, Mr. Trump put forward acute accusations for a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning the faith of Mr. Trump.
"We need energy", Trump observed Saturday during his campaigns in Iowa.
Five members of the department charged with the death of the phoenix of the Bar Society College.
Almost two years ago, after the death of a student in the department's ritual in Poconovuori, Pennsylvan, five people are subject to counts of murder.
Members of the Department of Pi Delta Psi of the Baruch College (City University of New York) brutally assaulted the baptismalists of Chu "Michael" Deng in September 2013 and said that Deng was not delivered by the department in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim’s eyes had been tied, his back had been put on a backpack of nearly 15 kg of sand and he had been repeatedly attacked in an attempt to reach the target placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is told first to choose a headache and then to lose consciousness.
According to the police, the members of Pi Delta Psi's department did not call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they are alleged to have waited an hour before taking Deng to the hospital.
Prime Minister Chris Wabner told the press conference that, however, members would be able to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms and contact the department president Andy Meng.
"At this point, the members began to hide the tools to put the interests of the department ahead of the health of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
Deng was unable to recover, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Dengi had been hit several times in the head, the upper body and I traveled on a boring object.
"A lot of families have been shocked by the blockery's embezzlement, as at least one student per year has died as a result of the blockage since 1970," says Douglas Fierberg, representative of Deng's family, in his opinion.
Divisions and their members must be responsible for where the authorities must take an important step.
Five members of the department were accused of murder in the first instance by a large jury of the Monro county.
In addition, 32 members of the department are charged with simplification and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We would like to receive responsibility not only for individuals, but also for the organisation that officially or informally accepted the simulation," Wagner told the press on Tuesday at the press conference.
Baruch College has imposed an operating ban on the department, and the State Department has resigned from the activities of the local branch.
This has an impact on the rise in the United States Central Bank (Fed) interest rates.
The rise in interest rates and the increase in the share price increased, the return on securities is rising and the economy is falling into recession.
We know that.
On the other hand, we do not know how long everything takes and how long the effects last.
As far as the economy is concerned, we will find historical indication of the timing.
The recession has arrived up to 11 months after the first raise in interest rates and has lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often aggressively raises interest rates, not always, but the decisive factor is how the economy and financial resources react.
The central bank officials have already stressed the fact that investors would not pay attention to the fact that the interest rate rises only begin to increase, as to how long it takes to normalise the situation.
Of course, there are several variables involved.
Finally, however, market operators may note that any interest-rate excrement may be excessive.
"The first raise of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly interpreted as a sign of the end of bad money," said Julian Jessop, Chief Economics' chief global economicist.
On the other hand, we do not expect a gradual normalisation of interest rates at a rather low level.
However, that does not mean that there is no effect.
Examples of how the effects can be seen in different economic areas, based on historical trends, are:
As has been seen on the market for that period, interest increases may increase instability for some time.
When interest rates rise, the effect is not so dramatic.
"The trend appears to be the stagnation of interest income on capital after the first raise for 12-24 months, which, in turn, reflects the delay in monetary terms," says Deutsche Bank's analyst in the recent study of the effects of interest rate increases.
More precisely, during 35 years, the market is generally seen by a sharp increase in interest rates, around 14 per cent, relatively steady for the next 250 days (mean increase of 2.6 per cent), by 500 days, and by 14.4 per cent, the average rate of return after an increase in the number of shares, says Bob Doll, Nuveen Asset Management's chief is equal to strategy Barron's magazine.
According to the guarantor, the effect on shares will generally increase at a slightly later stage in the cycle and interest income will start to decline.
The recession is a fact of the economy, but an increase in interest rates usually works for it.
In this case, if the central bank is faced with circumstances which did not exist before and which could drive the falldown.
It is of particular importance that GDP is the lowest in terms of the central bank’s reference rate at any given time.
According to Deutsche Bank, 118 steering rates were raised since 1950, only once the nominal value has been less than 4.5 per cent.
In the second quarter of 2015, 3.6 per cent, many thought it would last, and the third quarter was 1.5 per cent, says the central bank of Atlanta.
If interest rates are raised in such a sensitive economic situation, there may be a risk and you may ask whether this situation is different, Deutsche said.
Market participants have been talking about raising the interest rate throughout the year, and their eyes turn to this week's meeting of the Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), which will end on Thursday.
Many strategies and economic players believe that, even if the Open Market Committee accepts a raise at this meeting, future trade appears to be only 25% likely.
“Our studies from 1950 to now have been in a supercycle, where, even before the falldown, GDP is rising very quickly as the trend of the trend has started,” states the report.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst depression in the control cycle.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has been waiting for since the last recession. The record had been 35 months, now it is going to be 74 months.
The underlying fixed-income securities have been unstable in the market’s foreign exchange interest rate and the formula also recurs on capital terms.
"The basic difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the exchange rate.
For bonds, income appears to change direction as soon as the first cycle of increase/invoicing starts.
At the end of the upturn, revenues will fall immediately", Deutsche noted.
The leaders of Charles Schwab believe that the weightings make long and short-term bonds approach each other and the curve level.
"Credit bonds are often better in such an environment, although we are still cautious about income," said Analyst Kathy Jones, on fixed-income securities, Schwab.
Fascinatingly, according to Jones, the markets have already adapted to the future trend of the central bank.
"In addition to the confirmation of the dollar and the forecasts of inflation, there are already a number of signs to be seen regarding the tightening of financial policies," says Jones.
Short-term interest rates are on the rise, return is on the market, credit spreads are on the increase and volatility is on the increase.
Broadly speaking, companies that operate mainly on the US market will benefit as interest rates will fall and local products will become attractive.
The outlook for the international companies of the debtors is weaker, as the strong dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the debt more expensive.
"Historical shows that quality shares are more profitable than interest payments in the next three months," the analysts of Goldman Sachs inform their customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet were overcompensated by weak-balance sheet companies after interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Enterprises with a high return on capital and low volatility shares were also better in terms of quality, with an average of 4 and 3 percentage points better, respectively.
"There is a big question.
Enterprises with a significant share of variable interest payments lose the most," Goldman said.
Outside the market, consumers will in general also benefit from the confirmation of the dollar.
Savings will also benefit from higher yields, and experts are, of course, disagree as to how quickly the effects will be seen.
Parlamentari Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM.
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticises the campaign for excessive popularity.
According to Bingham, the channel is currently difficult to distinguish from its commercial competitor.
Also claims to be a copy of the BBC Music Awards Prizes for the Brits Gala only.
For its part, the President, Mr Damien Collins, blames the Voice channel for its impersonality.
According to a major parliament, BBC Radio 3 will gradually be converted into a copy of the Classic FM channel. The accusations will place pressure on the station to prove that there are other markets for each of them.
Consumer Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the broadcaster’s radio is becoming too popular and does not translate much more than its commercial competitor.
"I hate to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to be changing towards the Classic FM channel," Bingham said.
Also last December’s BBC Music Awards awards will receive criticism from Bingham:
"For the first time in the year, BBC Music Awards seems to be a copy of the Brits Prizes.
These two examples are examples of the fact that instead of new and different, they simply mimic what is already on the market", says Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC banned the accusations and concluded that the offer of BBC Radio 3 has far more live music and educational content than a commercial competitor.
"From Radio 3, I learned a lesson from classical music that I cannot learn from other channels.
The commitment of the Channel to live music and the making of music is entirely in its own class.
I also think it is important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," said the President-in-Office.
Last year, the leader of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, stated that the position must work harder to keep public interest, as the British know classical music better than the rest of the world.
Radio 3 has, however, not been the only critic of entering the territory of commercial channels in the consultation of the BBC Canal, the Limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Tory-party's Week Damienhir criticised The Voice ability search, which BBC bought from the Dutch producer Talpa Media. The price of the trade is estimated at GBP 22 million.
"The programme is not very debated, as it is not unique or particularly distinctive."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC, by which Paloma Faith and Boy George, as their stardom, were produced in a typical way for BBC.
In addition, the company claimed to look for a hit program in its own stable when it next launches a new show of entertainment.
However, he refused to rule out whether The Voice series would continue to be ordered or whether taxpayers' money would be used for other forms of entertainment.
The growth of net trade in all time in August – due to black Friday
In the first months of 2015, trade grew by seven per cent in the first month of 2015.
The sales of online trade have been recorded since 2000. Last month growth was the slowest in all times.
The online trade strengthened three years ago by mobile purchasing.
Experts believe that the black man of November can be abhorred by shopping desires.
For the past ten years, the takeover of online commerce has decorated many of the UK’s shopping shops.
According to experts, there are indications that the trade in the retail sector is improving and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase during the first three months of 2015.
In August, the growth in total sales was the slowest during the whole period when the sales of the online trade have been recorded, i.e. since 2000. Last year, the net sales increased by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that the trade in the retail sector is improving and new sales figures show only a 7 % increase during the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth to the 2000 figures, it is clear that the growth will stabilise over time", IRG's editor-in-chief Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, the trade accelerated three years ago, when consumers took up mobile purchases, according to Mulcahy.
"Therefore, more and more were able to buy from the network, and to what extent it was possible to buy in a different environment, perhaps by hand, with a pet.
While mobile mobilisation is now more moderate, growth can stabilise."
The black light from America is a phenomenon that is considered as one of the causes of growth slowing down.
According to experts, the last Friday of November can lead consumers to postpone the purchase decision before the black Friday.
Last year a five-fold number of network buyers compared to normal caused many traders’ websites to crash.
Experts believe that a black letter, which makes consumers suffocate on offers, can be abhorred by buying desires in the rest of the time.
According to a study published by the British Retail consortium, a fair pound of each of five pounds per pound was consumed online.
More than a third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of shopping for fashion shops.
In Meka, we bury the victims of nostrils, the family of Bin Laden, and the family of Bin Laden.
The Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funeral is held in Mekka.
Saudi Arabia claims that Saudi Binladin Group, a major construction company, is partly responsible for the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were also injured after the downfall of the crane.
The bodies were carried in high air when Muslims met to bury the 29 victims of the crane that had fallen upon the Great Moscow of Mekka.
There had been a crowd of people gathered on the streets to leave any favors to the victims on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moaisem.
The road of death passed through a pilgrimage site where a fallen builder had just one day previously penetrated through the roof of the Mosque on the Muslims.
The King of Saudi Arabia demands that Bin Laden’s construction family members be responsible for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 dead victims in the Mekka's Greatmoscheja disaster were transported on the streets.
In the fall of the crane among the dead was Qasim Akram, from Bolton of the Great Manchester, who had gone to Meka on his first sacrificial journey.
Akram had been with his parents in the Great Moscow who were about to start their annual visit to the Holy See.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that a hajj-sacre will be held when thousands of people are arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left up the crane’s boom when the crane was not used.
According to the German press release, the Binladin Group is involved in an accident.
The English service of the News Office did not report in detail. However, according to the English press release, the management of the group has been prohibited from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall out of the courtyard of the Great Moscow. Thousands of Muslims are heading for the Grand Moscow's sacred journey later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a notice on the nostalgic accident, nor has the Group's representatives been intended for the opinion.
The King also accused the group of failing to comply with the current safety regulations and cooperated with the meteorology experts.
The ten cranes are surrounded by Mekkan Nagymoskeijja as part of the giant construction project of the Binladin Group.
The Bin Laden family has been in close contact with the Saudi Arabian ruler family for ten years, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, president of Al-Qaida, was a apostate boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
Only a few days before the pilgrimage of Mecca, which is the duty of all capable Muslims to do at least once in life, took place in a heavy rainy and hard-on mood.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities ordered the payment of one million rials (EUR 250 000) for the victims’ families and those who were permanently injured.
The other victims of the accident receive half of the compensation.
According to the B&Q boss, there is a cheap Eastern European workforce behind the wind.
The British hire more generals at home, says Veronique Laury.
It has been enhanced by skilled, professional workers coming from Eastern Europe.
More than 200 new, professionally targeted Screwfix store will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfishher closes the 60 B & Q store around the ground.
Text: Rupert Steiner, chief author, Daily Mail
The British are said to shift home hammering and painting work to workers from Eastern Europe.
Vasing and painting skills seem to be infrequent today.
Today, the British are increasingly recruiting home generals to do domestic rocking work, reports the manager of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is the new Managing Director at Kingfisher, who owns the store chain for domestic supplies. According to Laury, the phenomenon is based on skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe who provide services at a good price.
Following the appearance, Kingfishher intends to open 200 new Srewfix stores for traders, while 60 B & Q shops will be closed.
Laury needs more female labour for B&Q stores, for eight out of ten purchasing decisions at the store makes women.
Currently most of the staff are men.
According to Lary, there is a need to take account of the demographic trends, as today more and more single women live alone are also making good use of their homes.
"The staff of our stores is still the majority of men," Laury says.
"We must balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of our products are made by women.
Women have an important role to play in the future process."
Laury is one of the five women who are at the top of companies in the UK FTSE 100 and has also reorganised the company's board of directors so that there is a level playing field between men and leaders.
Kingfishher is almost the only quality since 50% of its staff are women, including the Executive Director and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Diversity is an important topic for us," Laury told us.
"It has not been difficult to find good news for the board of directors."
Kingfish's operating profit and sales figures for the past six months are falling, even though the company worked hard after the closure of the stores.
Kingfishher responds to the current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and intends to open 200 new stores.
The three-year government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the economy.
The effects were also observed at a time point in time.
The sharp heads of the SAK and other employees' associations began to force immediately and as a result the earth will stand on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
In the opinion of many, then there will also be reason to reason.
Let's ask if you need to take the strike when you don't feel well about it.
It has even been established as a counter-restraint.
More than 50,000 people online have already come to report that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In an old good consensual period, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online site where you protest, but openly, incarnation would have been a murder of a small human being.
Millions of trade unions with a few tens of thousands of people's protests do not give much time, but it gives reason for thinking.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twelve years ago.
Not all of them are familiar with the objectives of the move, values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest in the operation of Ay movement, Government's restrictive solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling on their own agenda, it is now at last in connection with the matter, i.e. the rights of workers to defend themselves, clearly and properly.
Thus, the government may wish perhaps to imprison the role of ay movement when membership of the trade union is likely to become more important than before.
Whatever the opinion of the organizations is, it is silly that the expression of Friday's mind somehow stops Finland.
Finland has long since stopped. Finland has long since stopped.
For example, industrial output has already fallen 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things would seem to force all the decisions to come.
Lappeenranta University has a tough environment for saving: Objective 4.5 million savings, reduce staff by 130.
The technical university of Lappeenranta will open a savings account with the aim of obtaining a total reduction in costs of EUR 8,5 million.
As a part of the savings, the University will open the YT negotiations on the entire staff, with a saving target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, that means bringing about 130 employees into employment.
In addition, two million are being spent on other activities.
In the context of the Yt negotiations, the budget for 2016 is expected to be 4.5 million deficits for the actual operation.
It will also be affected by the government's cuts in appropriations.
During this financial year, the university will make a total of approximately 2.6 million deficits.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is about €85 million, so the saving target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction of corporate finance with our university is very important, says Principal Anneli Pauli, at the press release of the University of Pauli.
Before summer, the effects of the shocks seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears in a new relationship.
Discussions with the officials will take place next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to go to Finnish railways.
The owner of Onnibus, a British Sir Brian Soutter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Soutter says.
Rail transport is due to be open to competition.
The first thing to do is to change the distance between the capital district and 2017-2018.
Long distances are scheduled after long distances.
Souter tells us that he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
In the Ministry of Transport, Yle says that the Onnibus plans are welcomed.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed interest in other international companies in rail transport, which also has transport by bus in Finland and by rail in the rest of Europe.
The time of the ECB’s interest rate decision is the time of the NCB’s interest rate.
The whole world will be attending a meeting of the United States Central Bank Fed on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide on a possible increase in interest rates for the first time over a period of almost a decade.
Fair half of the economic accounts, which last year believed the central bank would raise interest rates, now be drawn by the central bank at the current rate of 0-0,25 %, as shown by the survey conducted by the Reuters 80 economists.
"This is a historical situation, since the central bank has kept the interest rate close to zero for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a significant central bank can raise interest rates from a zero level and thus trigger the normalisation of the ratios," said Angel Ubide, Senior Researcher at the Institute for International Economics, Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of extra dollars into the balance sheet and only slightly accelerated inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not as rosy as the one in the world.
It has called on the market to prepare for change, but there are also references to the opposite.
The decision is due to take place on Thursday at 20.00 central time.
The shooter of Delta State University left an application form.
After shooting his girlfriend at Mississippi on Monday morning — before shooting a colleague later on the same day — Shannon Lamb wrote a message asking for an apology for the first murder and hoping to cancel it, the two of them told me on Tuesday.
At Mississippi Guutier, Delta State University, a road and social teacher Lamb called the emergency number about 10 a.m. in the morning.
Monday and told me that he had shot a man.
Lamb asked the police to come home in an emergency call.
"I shot my wife last night", Black told me, and he also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, and there was no harm to anyone but probably scared.
The police asked me the name of the caller, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb also failed to explain the motive for the shooting.
The police will arrive at the site and find a message written by Amy Prentiss, 41, the body and Lamb, which reads as follows: "I am very sorry and hope that I can reverse what I did.
I loved her, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers to Delta State University where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of history before he took up his life late on Monday morning when the police caught him.
University Director William LaForge told me that he was not aware of the conflicts between Lamb and Schmidt, but stated that Lamb was in trouble.
On Monday, it was found that Lamb believed that Prentiss was also romantically related to Schmidt. However, on Tuesday, the authorities reported that there was no information or evidence about the trio.
For seven years with Prentiss, Shawn O'Ste, who was married to him, described his former wife as a good man.
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Sten told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who is shocked.
According to her husband, her daughter and mother were the best friends in the world.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss's, Lindsay Knowles, told me that Prentiss was working online from home.
Knowles found that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives during Monday and told them that he was not going to jail.
When the police took over Lambin Highway 1 near the East on the same night, Lamb stopped the car, ran off on foot, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the CV on the university website, Lamb received a doctorate in education at Delta State University in spring 2015.
Reduced stars
The last few years have been difficult for an actor (in the picture on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also fought drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything has really charged a fee for everything.
Audrey United in the United in the wrong side for months due to two fractures.
Rich's right leg was broken at the United Master's League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is sorry to be sidelined for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field for the rest of this period.
20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defence area by the bad capture of HGctor Moreno when fifteen minutes were in play.
She got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before she could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw has two fractures in his leg, and he's in hospital," said Van Gaal.
We'll move tomorrow or the day after tomorrow for surgery.
The young man who joined United at 18 years of age has experienced hard times and is now injured after the great matches.
In the dresser shop, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man cried.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg is broken in two places, he'll be sidelined for six months and he won't play in the block anymore.
I hope he's still able to play this season.
Moreno seemed to have arrived a little while the situation did not follow the red card's penalty kick.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
According to Van Gaal, the Italian judge made a mistake.
"You should judge it yourself, but I think the situation was worth the penalty kick and the red card.
It was a two-legged death-free play for two feet."
"Thank you for all your messages. I can’t tell you how crushed I am. My recovery begins here and I come back stronger."

The defenseman has a particular reason to recover from the race in order to participate in the European Championships in France in June.
"This is a very serious injury," said the PSV coach.
"In such situations of injury, all parties are always very sorry.
The purpose of the searchers is never to harm the opponent."
Moreo broke his legs when he was playing in Mexico's ranks the Netherlands, which Van Gaal created, did not until the 2014 World Cup competitions.
"He's very sorry, because his intention was not to harm the opponent. It's a shame to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I just saw the ball that was heading in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tacking."
"I know how it feels, I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 network.
"I feel really sorry for you, I'm very sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after a collision with Chris Sjing.
David Cameron should know Loraz better.
Everyone will know before long that the child learns his favorite book almost from the outside.
Except for you to see David Cameron.
When the Children's Holiday Organization asked Cameron to appoint his favorite of the registrations, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the teaching environment of Dr. Seuss, published in 1971.
In the text published on SuperCamp's website Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The story is fun, touching and creative, and it has a strong message. I will read it to my children, because there is always one picture or message that we have never seen before."
It sounds good, except that the next item where Cameron is going to describe the book plot is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to complete the short original text.
"In the town where the real trees and plants are lost, and even the air is a commodity, the boy named Ted, who wants to get his dreams into his heart by doing this greatest dream: seeing the true tree," the text says. In the 1991 version of Dr. Seuss or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted had no object of pleasure.
If this is not enough questionable, Cameron's text is partly in line with the design summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins with the following: "In a town where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, there is a boy named Ted who wants to get his dreams into the heart of a girl."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it is unlikely that the plot of the book would be such a stranger to him. Ahne Kerskanen loses trees and prepares them for the Needs for a name character despite the resistance of Lorax. Lorax is a small and thick, icy creature that protects the forests.
Likely, a minor pr mission such as this has been entrusted to an assistant, apparently to someone who has not read Loax 20 times as a child, and who has not read Loax 20 times as a tube.
The representative of the Prime Minister said that the text was probably from the Cameron Election Office.
SuperCamps did not comment on this more specifically but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was obviously in danger of being out of the British team, but it's still tough.
Pakistan's encounter in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the team selected for the U.S. tour, it is not expected that the last 3-0 series of tests will be lost again.
I wouldn't shut down the possibility of a guest victory.
Alistair Cook side may be more experienced than a three-year-old team, but the team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experience in 2012, just a youthful positive attitude.
As a ball player, Moeen Ali develops as a row feeder, and Adil Rashid, even if he has no Test-level experience, represents an attack option.
Subject: Adam Lyth dropped from the UK Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously a hard time for me to understand his head coach in Yorkshire.
Seven of his tests have been two good attacks against challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that the cruise players are judged according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because, as I have said before, players are the best choice.
A few 50-point prizes would have been held on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets a second chance when he hits the Yorkshire with more runnings.
Head coach, Trevor Bayliss, also praised his attitude when he did not do as well as he could, which does not surprise me. He is, above all, a team player.
It is difficult to ask how long the Test-Ripper gets the chance to take a stand.
Lyth received seven ground fights — like his successor Sam Robson — while Nick Compton received nine.
Only Compton was given the opportunity at both home and guest matches.
The only issue to be complained about is perhaps that England first used the Trotti in the Caribbean – while Lyth was in state of peak — but this past event is now history.
Alex Hales comes to the team and he's a hitter, who I value high.
He is an unknown player in the cricket game that we saw in Yorkshire earlier this month when he scored two points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his applicants, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Emirates team.
The idea has been cast into the air that Moee will start a dialogue with Cook, which will lead to an extra round-eater in the game while holding four fast-eaters, and I am not against the idea.
I see no obstacle to the high-level feeder being able to beat here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a brilliant cricket player.
The show may not have received so much from his local team at Workestershire, but he has been the team's third player, and that's not a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 Test matches as his first replacement player before starting in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points, and there was no turning back.
Zafar Ansari is on the team as a spare row feeder, and on the basis of what I have seen of him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistics – an average of 31 points as a hitter and 35 as a feeder – and this may be a search shot, but a very large number of cyclists have not shown themselves to be ready, and the voters have decided to take a young player.
He will learn a lot during this visit.
Outside the gambling team, England seems to have made a couple of intelligent choices for its coaching staff.
The appointment of a Sri Lankan hitter, Mårjajawarddenen, as adviser to test matches can be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most delicious men of all, who brings much experience with him because he has been afraid of all kinds of circumstances and attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball of the game tour, including both energy and mercy.
I think he's always influenced an appropriate international critic, whether he's a player or coach, and like Mahela, he's got a very useful mind.
A new noise in the dressing room, even if it says the same as before, can be a boost injection.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has been resting for one day at the match, Root got the same chance against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everybody agrees, the coach and the selectors do not set the time schedule for the selection.
And it should be borne in mind that, like the players, their job depends on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without the need to take them.
The Brext camp can be won if the economy is at a low level in 2017.
David Cameron's half-time renegotiation of Britain's stay in the EU is in a deeper line every day, even without the pleasure-loving "yes or no" of Corbynia's choice for the leadership of the working party or TUC to mock Europe in a rough Tuesday.
Other countries also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Farags.
In recent times, a European diplomat explained how many crises the EU is in – although not everyone is doing what they do – some of the Member States have been bored of the British self-sufficient agenda, which includes disunity concessions and harmful changes in the Treaty that they do not really want.
In Brighton, the TUC's annual UK, it was decided that they, too, would not like the EU if it broke down the social security system.
Maybe you could call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor-General will hang at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, capture a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without seniors, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to have an open-minded UK inside the EU. "Don't leave us alone with Elő", Berlin says and suggests that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in different capitals have come to the point that he doesn't care anymore whether we stay or go.
Mr. Hitler, the Federal Chancellor of the United States of America is an ally, but he has been in power for ten years now and wants to resign before it is destroyed, as happened to those who stayed too long: Attcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France Francois Holland faces a re-election or the choice of a successor in 2017.
The power of the mind is fading.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing government again in Spain.
It is hard to imagine them moving around to help selfie britts, who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it either because most of them have separatist abilities.
Some of these ministers may be planning to deliberately make useless comments, like the Scottish National Party in the 2017 United Kingdom National Electoral campaign, which wants to rush the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
The new negotiations had been organised. "There was nothing left for Britain to do with the renegotiation negotiations."
Europeans know how the British press are being caught and how the EU sceptical on-the-art press is, as was the case with Tony Benn's 'Yearly referendum', the result of which was in favour of a 2-1 accession to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps you can recall from a distance Boris Johnson, the cumbersome Euro-Oportunist, who came to be known as "our EU direct banana correspondent" in the early 90s in Brussels.
Mimiband, at least, found his enemies.
They include tax evasion, telephone hacking and apparent temporary pensions, which own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had about the same history, but then realized that when you're in a cage with a rough gorilla, you have to stretch bananas as a spider so that the gorilla doesn't count you both for lunch and dinner.
Mihiband was even more blatant in his opposition to the referendum, and he agreed to the European Constitution, which was then rejected.
The world never forgave him for anything else.
But nice Corby, who killed me kindly back at Westminster on Monday. I told him that he had no more time to waste on me. It may be a danger that he would launch Neil Kinton’s media boycott strategy from the 80’s. It was a mistake and it is still a mistake.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for social dialogue with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, who was sitting on the BBC couch on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyn in Europe is what we politely call a builder.
He says he wants to keep us in a reformed EU.
Most people outside Ukip and Tory are likely to be responsible for this.
That's what Hilary "Benn But Not Bennit" Benn told me on radio and television this week, when his internal patrol officer tried not to blame Corbyn for being a bad move to call the rough John McDonnell Minister of State.
It reminded me of the '70s, when his old father had difficulty in being too far away from his fellow Members of the Labour Party on television and not losing it right in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said that he would oppose staying in the EU under "all the circumstances." McDonald did not say that and neither did Corby's colleagues and members of the lower room for a private meeting on Monday evening.
Corby wanted to convey any image of the suckling, it must be remembered that he even touched me. The sculpture is important for a 24/7 period, especially in social media discipline, where healings and fraud are committed.
Cameron does not need to be given a free passport in relation to the EU, which would allow him to view the support of Labour as obvious in the vote, as McDonnell has stated.
Mr. Jenkins is certainly in agreement with that.
The equivocation of McDonnell and Corbyn on EU membership is suitable for the history of the island economy and anti-capitalism. Discussions are no longer just a small circle of left-wing dissidents who have the idea of combining similarity with others is a key lesson in doctrineary chaos.
There has also been an equivation on NATO, and Tom Watson is an impertinent fact that Corby is not campaigning for his departure, and foreign diplomats must try to clarify the matter in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste capital? They have suspicious voters. Why should they grant concessions to Britain when everything can be futile?
The United States has already been quite disappointed with the unfortunate British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even during the Tory Government, and I was reminded of that on Monday during the launch of the British Influenza Security Forum.
Experts criticise the British authority's opinions on e-cigarettes.
According to researchers, the arguments of a state-funded institution that the burning of e-cigarettes is 95% less harmful than traditional smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 participants linked to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticise the evidence set out in the report by the public health care authority Public Health England (PHE) in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal on electronic cigarettes.
Phe described his report last month as a "reversible and comprehensive review of the results".
However, a number of researchers have questioned the security of information and raised certain links with the tobacco industry.
In last month's publication of the Lance Medical Journal, "a very thin foundation" was taken on the basis of the main conclusion of the PHE.
In addition, two researchers at BMJ have wondered whether the arguments were based on "hard or sand".
Martin McKee and Simon Capewell, Professor of Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool at the University of Liverpool, said: "The basic assumption of public health is that the policies are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKe and Capewell, the public assumes that Phe's claim that "at present, according to the best estimate, electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The complaint is based on one of the 12 meetings convened for the development of a multi-purpose analysis model based on multi-term decision analysis (MCDA), a model designed to harmonise the participants' views on the harmfulness of nicotine products. The results of the meetings were compiled in the study.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the supporters of the meeting included EuroSwiss Health, which has been funded by the British American Tobacco (BAT) according to sources for the Director-General's own research.
The Executive Director, in the report on the sustainable operation, supported the activities of BAT in line with public health.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting provided funding from an electric power-generating producer. However, the alleged financing from Philip Morris International was not granted by Philip Morris International.
The selection criteria for the composition of the panel have not been explained, but there are several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which contribute to the financing of the industry.
However, participants are not aware of their expertise in the fight against smoking.
Phe was also attended by a counter-sponsor for the meeting.
According to McKeen and Capewell, the study report of the group shows that there is no clear evidence of the harmfulness of products in terms of a wide range of products and compliance with their criteria.
However, no links or deficiencies are mentioned in the Phe report.
According to the PHE report, so far, there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes can contribute to the smoking of children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim to be premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, Phe’s Director for Health and Welfare, these claims have been answered earlier.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are far less harmful than conventional smoking.
Each other of the people who smoke through life dies because of their dependence on tobacco.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are lower than those of traditional tobacco; however, the long-term effects need to be looked at more closely.
PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not show, especially in circumstances where relative risks are unclear compared to the actual trade.
In the United Kingdom almost 80 000 cases of death related to smoking occur each year, and smoking costs two billion pounds per year for public health care.
Responsible action requires us to provide a clear indication of the current evidence that electronic cigarettes are not a risky option, but the disadvantages they cause are a fraction of the damage caused by traditional tobacco.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says the Channel 4 boss.
Luke Johnson, who was at the head of Channel 4, has found that the BBC should stop sending certain programmes, including EastEnders and The Voice. Johnson says that commercial competitors would give their right hand on hit stories, such as Albert St.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should be used only for the execution of programmes which are not carried out by other institutions.
He criticised BBC for presenting programmes that are likely to be more accessible to the public at the same time as the programmes of the large number of viewers of competitors, as well as, for example, the BBC.
After the Director General of the BBC, Tony Hall, announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that for six years, he tried to get Channel 4 cooperation with BBC, results.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC will buy formats and send programs that would clearly be part of a competing channel software", Johnson told Parliament's Upper Room Communications Committee, which explained the future of BBC.
If BBC wants to keep a broadcast, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium to long term, it should reduce its supply at least for programmes which are not produced and purchased by others.
The BBC will send The Voicea at the best viewing time because it wants the widest possible support for each and every one of them.
If any other channel doesn't care about the program, it's clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why a regressive tax should finance programmes that could be financed without aid", Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders another, even though it is its own production.
A lot of channels would give you the right hand of it.
I do not understand how this serves the service provision of the broadcasting company.
I don't think this would be a loss to BBC."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur, led by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, who believes that the BBC had good ratings, because the company employs ambitious people and believes that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on the BBC's most popular series are similar to that of the former Sky-Pompomby Ball, which suggested MacTaggart's lecture in 2003, that BBC sells out series such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the BBC’s Niche programme is displayed on the BBC network, where viewers are most often not able to measure, but the programmes are suitable for their purpose. “The BBC may say in its defense in front of his artificial mission of four billion pounds of public broadcasting charges, having made special programmes that no one considered.”
"BBC presents them at times when no one will ever see them."
Concerning broadcasting charges, Johnson said: "I am going to hire you to look for another, in that sense, as a rigid system, that who can get the best out of him.
Everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is cheap, but people for whom it is a big sum, especially if BBC is not looking very much."
David Elstein, Director of former Sky and Channel 5 channels, who also expressed his own views on Tuesday in the committee, noted that the BBC should change its mission to "information, education and entertainment".
According to Elstein, there are hardly any educational programmes available today for BBC – TV 1% and radio 0.1%. He adds that the BBC should learn from the Australian and Canadian public broadcasters and put its mission into a new belief: "information, lighting and entertainment."
On the issue of cooperation, Elstein suggests that BBC could increase broadcasts, for example, of events, such as the Proms Festival, whose concerts were broadcast last year only a fraction of a break. "The BBC should also join allies with commercial channels in order to make the entire offer available online," he adds.
The brain cells can be controlled by sound waves using sonogenetics.
The video shows how to change the direction of the shuttle laxation when they are hit by a discharge.
Researchers have grown worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, and thus worms can be controlled at a wide distance.
The small diaphragms change their direction when they are exposed to an ultrasound with a frequency above the human ear hearing area.
Sound waves activate motion nerve cells that have been genetically modified with a transport medium that reacts to the discharge.
More: Researchers follow the brain’s activity through light.
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the power of a new sonogenetic method (dubbed sonnetics) using a medication from outside the body to induce brain, heart and muscle cells.
Researcher Salk Instute in California, La Jolla, Sreekanth Chalasani told Guardian that one day the method could replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method used to stimulate the brain with electrical pulses to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
Calasani noticed that the worms are starting to react when they are placed in a liquid with a microscopic cut-off bubble.
According to Calasan, the bubbles amplify the suburbs that travel through the worms.
The confirmed peak waves affect the TRP4-ion channels, which are part of worm cell cells.
According to an article published in the Nature Communications magazine, audio waves can open and re-energize cells that are attached to these ion channels.
In order to control the shuttle ponds in a vast distance, Chalasani transmutated the worms genetically so that some of the nerves that control their movement appeared in the TRP4-ions.
When control of the modified earths was carried out, the microwaves strengthened the sound waves and passed on to the worms, when the signal went off in the nerve cell.
The method reminds us of a little bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate nerve cells with light.
According to Calasan, however, sonogenetics has certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
Light is directed towards the brain under investigation by light fibers. Low-haired discharges, on the other hand, penetrate the cell easily, so the discharge can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that gene therapy and virus therapy can provide the immediate exposure of human nerve cells to ultrasound signals in a local environment for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture devices – in your doorstep!
Advertisements are a disappointment to British arms trade in arms.
Look at the Amnesty International arms video of the anti-Amnesty International.
Creepy killer missiles.
The leg irons that break the ankles.
The vineyards.
Prostates that cause insufferable pain but do not leave a trace.
The joyous sound and drawings clearly reveal that this advertising of the world’s largest stations is a parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International and is designed to highlight the British government’s aim of selling weapons to repression governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) fair in the ExCel Center in London, Docklands.
More about: DSEI events: authoritarian regimes arrive in London.
There are also posters in the bus and subway stations that require another look.
"A major announcement: are you moving by metro between 15 and 18 September?" The notification resembles the London metro announcements in appearance. On the other side of the metro line there is a picture of the tanker on the other side of the line.
"In September, a number of arms dealers arrive in Docklands, asking customers for help so that the stations can be stopped."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective collection called Special Patrol Group, which helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound "fly hacking package" with six keys that claim to have access to about one-third of the world's bus stop posters.
Transport for London is not a laughter of vandalism.
One of the special Patrol Group’s collective top-notifications.
According to the Curator of Cruel Designs and the Lecturer of Essex University, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question things and wish to bring their work to the public to be seen outside the gallery.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art is brought into the real world, and so many move on to work with protest movement activists.
One of the anti-arms posters welcomes the public transport users on the metro.
Amnesty video has been viewed through Facebook more than 100,000 times a day, designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the times have also done their job without compensation.
The artistic director of the VCCP Matt Lever, met with the absence of a mass loss and an empty face in the ExCeL event calendar, who thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They're trying to turn a more realistic, shady company video, but bright colors and animation will bring more attention."
"They have done a great job and helped us to highlight the trades in illegal torture equipment," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
"Now the government must take action and ensure that the means of torture are not illegally traded at our home door."
However, the most creative element of the fairs is displayed in the exhibition halls at ExCeL, where designers make use of excellent landscapes for their goods.
In his press release, Saab announced an order made by the United States Army concerning the "submission of AT4CS RS" by the US Army.
The product includes "a special-shaped warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
That doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight gold rules for students living in student housing units.
I moved to college 11 years ago, and I was innocent 19 years old, and I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, and I can only now remember the violent smiles I pissed off, and countless, long complaints to remember.
The most important teachings I can sum up to eight simple rules.
Moving to the residential area is at least a difficult experience and, at the very worst, a shocking experience.
It is easy to reason: you tell everyone you are, did you have a year and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "just hate or love Marmite, because it's just ski, hahahahahahahaha, I'm in my room".
Take a breath between you and me.
And help others breathe: show your interest and ask questions about other things.
The consultation will guide the debate and help you to find people you like and people you wouldn't talk to even if your eyelashes were on display and these people would share the switches.
Give me some room.
Private rooms often act as drinking desks, movie theaters and public house buildings, but their own room is also a place to dress, starting with underwear.
More: Don’t even think about combining social and university studies with each other.
For introverts, the university is a tough place to stay.
The private room should be a place to calm down. However, in many dormitories there is a social culture that travels from room to room and creates life-long friendships.
The culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place to return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say: "I like you and I want our friendship to go on, but I want you to get out of here so that I can recharge the energy I used to socialize with you."
Find out if any of your fellow students are exhausted from social contact. Perhaps you should not knock on the door and send a message instead.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
In my own student residence, there was a guy who thought the door was a lock-in meant that he was welcome in.
He saw everything.
Learn how to bake with bread.
You start your study properly when the bakery is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50s, a little strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I'll bake you something small.
Homemade treats are a good way to get new friends.
Your partner needs to talk to you, and a pleasant surprise will allow them to have a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bread skills from you.
If you serve bad cooks of flour, sugar and fat, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
The cooking of food is also a general failure in student housing.
Of course, taking another chicken is stealing, but can you pour a drop in your tea from someone else's milk can?
Always ensure milk from the owner.
Most likely you'll get a permit, even if the milk loan is also the owner of the jar of your yurps.
I understand well that it's annoying if someone's shaking something from you. Nevertheless, try to take care of the situation as much as possible – unlike my own student friend who threw his milk into his milk as a resort to milk thieves.
She's in jail now.
Don't make a noise while others try to sleep or to beat it.
It's not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that everyone digs a hole...
In my own dormitory, a girl asked the neighboring room resident to move the music further than the pace, for it was 3 a.m. in the morning and she had a exam this morning.
The neighbor just increased the volume.
When I finally got quiet in the room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours, and she left for three hours at the exam, left the music to take her room and lock the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to be moving to the same dormitory?
And wouldn't it be weird if you first thought your co-worker would be your next mate, you'd start dating, divorce, and you'd see him every day and lose the right to meet your common friends with him?
Of course, the heart will do whatever it takes. If the student friend is definitely not the only one, try to resist the desire.
If you notice at a small moment that someone has forgotten their keys to a room whose door is not locked, the limit of tricking and bullying is worse than you could think.
A good joke is fun, but a fun one to recover from in a moment.
The hiding of an object may be a valuable and funny teaching, but no room should be mutilated with toothpaste and moss pool.
The door of the other room can lock and drop the keys in a glass of water placed in the freezer, but do not attach any items to the ceiling with a mustard several times more than once in a few minutes.
Racist impact on the residence of foreign students in Kiteella - The house envisaged by the reception centre was set up in Salo.
A racist attack on Kite in northern Karelia took place on Saturday morning at the residence of foreign students.
Unlike the police, this is not the accommodation of underage asylum seekers, but the bed facilities for foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Lukkainen, teacher of the evangelical university of Kite.
The buildings of the University of Nations windows and walls were framed with racist signs, such as forklifts, and a metal object was thrown through a single-room window, reports East Finland’s police.
According to Likkainen, who is responsible for the education and training of young people in the National University, there were about 10 people at the time of the attack in the building under violence.
"There was a family and adult people who are free to move, so there could have been a part elsewhere", says Rich.
The law has people who are accommodationd from 12 different nationalities.
In Finland, they are already some of the students who have been in Finland and newly arrived underage asylum seekers.
All those in a mixed building have a status.
She is studying in an adult education school, she is in vocational studies and she is studying in Finnish," says Rukkainen.
A status is so-called a permanent residence permit that can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland Police are investigating a blow as an injury and a violation of the peace of home.
According to the report, a press conference was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's nothing here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had a foreign student for the second year, and this is the first time that something happens," says Monk.
According to everyone, the mess has been cleaned out of the walls by now.
At least three men were suspected of doing this and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the climax of a youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," the Rich says.
Salo also has a hospital designed for a reception centre in Salo.
The incident happened last week.
This was reported on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
The wall of the hospital was characterised by a hakarist and written in English "You are not welcome."
A criminal report has been made to the police.
Acquainted with the incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will stop the Y-train from going to the Arm of the Cow - passengers in a whimpering, "the idiotic" kind of thing.
The Y-train from Helsinki to the Raesepor Karja will cease to pass in March.
The news was agitating the arrival of passengers on the train in Helsinki at the main railway station in the first 24 hours of the day.
In particular, the landing hits the Sanitítian people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says with HHTV interview video that he's coming to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains on the main track are merged into a new R-line.
The power station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusla will remain out of operation.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and the Media and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry bought road transport for the following contract period.
The period will vary year-on-year and there will be terminating routes throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, which will last in autumn, will be adopted by the Monetary Committee later on.
Siunti Bengtström considers that the State's railway car is a short-lived operation.
Make mistakes that have been made before and are repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance on top of it.
Y-trains are also used by others other than Raaseporians and Sants, because it is fast and bypasses several stations.
In Finland, Annanina Table was a nuisance for the fate of those who travel more than the city area.
"It is absolutely unfortunate for those who are going to reinvent their journeys," he said when he was in pain on his Y-train.
A slight relief is permitted.
There must be a new train line on the coastline to replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HL) area, i.e. to take it to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase the cost to HSL, i.e. actually to the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service area and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, Executive Director of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for Y-train in about a million years, the Ministry will pay much more than that.
The R-line on the main track skips between two positions.
On the other hand, the number of train shifts in Ainola and the Sauna Hill is doubled.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys rail transport on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Kuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The small hill-Joensu route is shortened to the route Piksämäki-Varustus.
On the routes Ríihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, the port of Kouvola-Kotka and Kajani-Oulu will be reduced.
More than half a million trips per year are made at layoffs, while the total number of journeys purchased by the supplier is about nine million.
The purpose of this agreement is to provide the State with annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman's book entitled "You Should Check With Marx" in the book Capital Issues.
The global economic crises have brought to light Karl Marx (18-18/1883) and his final work on Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes in a book published today by Yrjö Hakanen, the first President of GDP, in his book Marx's capital.
"He will now be taken more seriously than he has been for a long time", Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx’s estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of capital into all areas of life, the accumulation of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly distant.
The title of the book on the basis of the Capital Seminars is also published in the list of the Professor of Aalto University, the valued economic partner Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman, Marx writes that the current “now and forever” of Marx is written by Korkman.
Is not, however, a Marxist, the former Executive Director of the Department of Economic Research and the Committee of Economics?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not view Marx as an economic operator but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are different and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The general idea is that the staff is told of the wrong views of the men of the dead," Korkman begins.
True, Marx's predictions went seriously wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early part of capitalism, my question by Korkman.
However, Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now discussing the interests of Marx again, such as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a big picture, as a result of technical revolutions change the world", Korkman's analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thought that capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Again, Marx is in favour of studying Korkman’s views on Marx.
"The '70s Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"The Mao and Trotskys and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more so each other.
Today, the debate is more frequent, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weights of the years of the year to come.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's world of thinking - as in other classics," says Korkman.
urges war criminals to be judged in Sri Lanka.
Calls on the creation of a Special Court to investigate the war of war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as the Tamil tigers for the crimes of war.
In the Sri Lanka civil war, at least 100,000 people are estimated to have died.
There are no precise data on the number of victims.
Especially the major armed forces attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for it.
The report by Sri Lanka’s armed forces blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as much as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed the coercion of bystanders and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to carry out an investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In the U.S. Yo-Test, it was possible to puntrate social media.
On Wednesday, the study of the autumn was in turn a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 volunteers tested their skills.
The test may have produced material from social media, for example.
Based on our experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
In the alternative, the English word 150-250 could be presented to the administrator of the web newspaper’s advisory column.
The weekend was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the rest chair in Leelia, Finland.
He had to ask how you should look at things for young people as well.
The total number of subjects was four, of which one had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assesses the third subject in the English lecture Mia Lybeck of the Swedish-language high school in Porvoo.
On this subject was only a link from the former President of the European Commission, Mr José Manuel Barroso, on behalf of the European Commission.
The second point was, according to Lybeck, it was pretty nice.
That's where it was supposed to be a talk of why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we've been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment "smoke normal".
In the English or Swedish experiment, questions were asked about texts that included, for example, adaptation to climate change and processing of large amounts of data.
A small number of Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on a Friday, where another domestic test, whether Swedish or Finnish, will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the experiment is conducted normally, i.e. the expression of employees does not affect it.
The University Court of Justice is asking the students to search the appropriate routes in time for an opportunity to reach a trial.
A period may also be granted if it can be demonstrated that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
In Oulu, a trade was struck with a gun at risk.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning a trade was struck in the town of Kello.
According to the police, the shooter had gone into dark places and a face-to-face commando shop.
The man is normal-celled and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
This case is being investigated as a gross robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland.
The protest against the government's cuts decisions will block the City Centre on Friday, predict the police.
Up to tens of thousands of people may arrive as soon as a preliminary request is made.
The members of the SAK, Akava and RTD associations will meet at the Railway Agency at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of mind.
On the other hand, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out the alarm and other police activities, but also to ensure that the sense of self-expression is carried out.
The roads leading to the railway station shall be blocked from motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed into the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be routed from Kaisaniemi to the transport circle, from the west from the mainland to the mainland.
Is Rohin enough for the police force, Captain Seppo Kujala?
Well, for the time being, it looks like that's enough.
I do not take the position on matters relating to the work of a police officer.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is coming from other parts of Finland because of a demonstration.
There's no telling by a precise patrol officer.
"Somethin' is coming, but we're most likely doing well on our own," says Kujala.
The police call on you to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki this Friday.
Kujala considers that the worst traffic ticket extends from Hakaniemi to the center of the centre.
Expecting traffic is expected from the morning until the beginning of the evening.
With protestors arriving from other parts of Finland, Helsinki also has many order buses coming to Helsinki.
They shall not be allowed to the Railway Market.
Buses are basically going to be a little bit off-road.
The rest of the trip must then walk to the venue of the demonstration," says Kujala.
The expression of mind also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From the point of view of the politician, there is also a positive side here.
The issue of public transport flow, which is normally at hand in these large assembly meetings, will now be taken care of in part.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that Helsinki may become tens of thousands of opposition to government economic policy.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary people working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday throughout Finland.
In many ways, Perjanta's demonstration is exceptional - do you remember these varnishes and mental expressions?
In many ways, the great demonstration of protest on the Friday of trade unions is interesting and unusual in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siiseinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder, however, that the ay movement protests.
If not, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Siisinen.
A well-righted government has struck the fundamentals of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also the places that have been important for the development of Finnish welfare.
The government's strong grips are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that ay-movement is actually trying to get on their knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
It is now the sharp division that the demonstration of mind creates in the part that the ay-motion would like to participate in the demonstration.
In November 1993, the unemployed who met across Finland showed their minds in the Parliamentary House.
If you're looking for a point of reference for a Friday's demonstration, it could be a big picture of the unemployed, but it's a break-in from 1993," says Siisinen.
In the middle of the deepest depression organized by Murrourstai gathered a total of 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Ahon (central) government collapsed from the labour market crisis to the second.
It was said that the relationship between the Government of Finland and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as in the Aho district government before.
Now the difference between the government and the ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
On the other hand, Finland is in power now, as far as I am concerned, the most important bourgeois government of Finland is ever, says Siisinen.
In this way, the present government coalition is still so interesting that it is so tightly right despite the speeches of the basic Finns.
At the time of the breakage there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousands of protestors are expected to arrive on Friday.
The expression of mind also stops public transport and possibly closes days and schools.
While the demonstration does not receive indivisible support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
Some 300 protests have been held in Helsinki each year in recent years.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the demonstrations by the Finnish Ay movement have been very calm - even though the way of doing things has been tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict; they are law-abiding.
Thoughtmakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisinen.
However, new winds brought new winds in the late 1990s.
Thought culture changed.
EU membership nervous farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get the shit out of them.
The strike of judges lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes for pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
In the 1970s, metal and electrical lakes for metal and electricity in the 1970s.
The most important strike in the 1970s was a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electrical strike in 1977.
The Board of Governors took part in 70,000 metalmen.
The layoff was held on a proposal from the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise in wages and salaries.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power failure all over the country.
February, 1993.
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met for the House of Parliament, many who made the recession unemployed, to vote in favour of the work.
The firemen striked for three months in 1998.
The strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless it was the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999.
In 1994, policemen were forced into egg rain in protest against the EU by farmers.
"Siberia teaches, Europe ends," was one of the slogans.
Farmers caught tons of snow.
In 1999, too, the Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and to the flood of the grass palaces in front of the meeting place.
Nurses quit 19 May and 1995.
Nurses quit for about a month in 1995.
The first time they had been in a home in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
The threat was on strike and the rise of nurses in 2007.
In the end, the negotiations were speeded up by the threat of mass deportation.
Doctors stopped by
"Doctors on strike - escape," was the slogan of strike doctors on strike in 2001.
The municipal health centre and hospital doctors' strike lasted five months and brought about a lively discussion on how the strikes could endanger the safety of the patient.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students moving in 2013
Some 5 000 students marched for academic support in Helsinki from the Secretariat to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out the background to the police of a refugee-filled Finnish truck.
The police have been asked by the police to assist the central criminal police in the investigation of the backgrounds of a refugee return registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped at the Asteroids near the German border by a truck with 42 refugees on board.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Everyone was in good health when they were on the cold truck.
We've had an exchange of information with the police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are on site in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, some refugees travelling on a truck in Austria became more fatal than others.
At that time, all 71 passengers who were on board at the time apparently died by suffocation.
According to the Public Broadcasting, the truck is owned by a Finnish public limited company, according to the Public Broadcasting Company, which first reported on cooperation with the police.
The company operates, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign-based man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqiisms have been arrested for the transport of human beings.
The escapee-wrecking captain, a former drug addict and a poignant businessman - the story of five smugglers.
The famous king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the elegant missionary and the taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
These people, for example, are engaged in the transport of human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book The Death Travel Office will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the compartments of human trafficking, submit proposals for solutions and present smugglers from different steps of business.
HH records five of these.
I'm gonna get rid of them right away.
The Kerkenna Islands in the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunish people are heading for summer transport there.
The islands on behalf of their location are also excellent for smuggling, since the journey to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, in the chain of the incinerator and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for the fisherman to transport people.
It's been done by Emir's tiny, ten-metre-long woodwork hundreds of times already.
If you melt the boat, it'll contain 40 people.
One trip Emir will earn some EUR 8 000 after spending.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a vast number of Tunicans wanted to escape from restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until the crisis began to rise again.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Revenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers just and just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if the customer runs out of money in the middle of the night, that's their problem.
We're going to the water in mid-summer shorts. We're going to the water in mid-summer.
The first day, you drive off the islands, then you stop, wait for the day, and then you drive to Lampedusa the next night.
At times the sea is hard, and in waves up to 20 metres high, passengers cry and vomit.
At its destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for his return trip.
Emir wants them to fear him.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the speakers to death.
He says in the book that when the police saw him once, he threw all of his passengers over the edge and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I infiltrated clients one by one and threw them across the street," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
According to his countrymen, he has to suspect this as a matter of urgency.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them who's in charge immediately.
Normal cab driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bologna, Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter engine is drawing on the latest and it's seen the best day of its life.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi moves in general and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Boša is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
Near the village is the centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly sent to families.
In the forests around the center, men travelling without themselves can stay in tents, ploughs and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
The forest also includes families who have not submitted an application for asylum to Serbia for reasons or for another.
Some also stay in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Goran, among the forests, finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walks in difficult countryside, often mountainous areas and in the dark.
Coming back to the Bologna area, the hub of a large cargo of human beings, people are dying of death.
Goran's visitors are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he'll tell you in the book.
"They say the right thing once and that's enough," Goran thank you.
According to him, the Africans are trying to tickle.
Goran doesn't like it.
The hulk of the hulk of the hulk of the hulk of the humbug throughout the way.
First, the price is agreed on, for example, EUR 300, then they'll lower it to 200, and then they'll offer 150.
Goran stressed that he was a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells you what he's doing at a cheaper price than the rest of us and spends less than 50 euros on a trip to the Hungarian border.
There are three hundred miles of travel, most of which are comfortable on the highway.
They say that colleagues will request a three- or four-time price.
Goran deserves approximately EUR 50 000 per year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a good year's income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis must not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the short paths and takes his guests a mile from the border.
Then he points to the right direction and hurdles away.
The work of piety at work.
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and that is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where many believers fled the Congo, and a small centre where children refugees from Congo are helped by Congo.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the gauze of the white under the lower waist of the jeans is sneezing in a cheetah of the bonnets.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer will first call one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary’s five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money in a viscera and slip it into a box of traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities need to be informed that they are from, for example, the North Kivu Military Territories and that they have had to flee from their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary will arrange a new life for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and someone else will be replaced.
That's how the Missionary's contacts with Ugandan police will be maintained.
After that, it will be directed where the right asylum seekers are going: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, finally the United Nations Organisation for Asylum in the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a fugitive himself.
He invoices each port separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, providing documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process, for example, for one European country between EUR 4 500 and 7 000.
Foliot and ice pieces.
Tom is an instigating smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A 40-year-old Irish patrolling on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into cargoes travelling to Britain.
He's got an Afghan, French cab driver and ten truckers in London who may not even know they're in the traffic of human beings.
At night Tom and the cab driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They drive a highway to A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting on drugs for seven years.
Taxi stops, Tom runs over customers' freeways to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing to cross the canal across the Britts.
The choice of a suitable truck must be made sure that it is going to England, not perhaps the Netherlands, and cut off the safety gear of the protective shield.
It must be done silently so that drivers do not wake up.
A driver is on the run, but then the run is more expensive.
The route is clear, Tom wrapped his customers in a aluminum foil, similar to the one wrapped in the kitchen around a pastry or oven potato.
It should prevent police heat scanners from detecting a hider.
It is common to use frozen sleeping bags filled with ice for that purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the place, hoping he doesn't run for a little sneakers, at least before Britain.
King of the smugglers
Muamer Küèuk is one of the world's most famous human transporters.
Uporical Turkish law has been called the Master of Marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal uprisings of the Mediterranean, who manages maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Kyle has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has one competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he's just asking for the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury shipwreck: a Turkish port is rented for pleasure, as if to export US or European families to a few days' tourist tours.
In reality, ships are loaded to a full extent by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans transporting from Istanbul to Europe at EUR 5 000-7 000 first from Istanbul.
Customers are kept in animal storage, such as old industrial farms, until it is time for them to leave.
People go to minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are encouraged to hide among the environment and to wait for a mark.
When it is given, it is necessary to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must keep their entire journey under the deck hidden.
The Security Council can only observe how far the ship is swimming, as no other sign of the crowd is visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers out and throw up, the better.
The kük will receive approximately 53 000 euros of one luxury ship after spending.
He does not do the practical things himself, but he hires the captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other minor agents to do the work on his behalf.
At least hundreds of shipments will be held during the summer and millions will be made by Kyçük.
He is expected to have bought through undercover companies through country, pharmaceutical companies and over 100 housing he rents.
Muamer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish representative of the Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office book will appear here, not next week.
The book reports on its disease and its becoming a prostitute in the book of the American Olympics.
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-metre runner, competed at the Olympics three times, has attracted attention to the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of ending and running his career into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published a summary of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton made his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competitions in peak condition and ran out for the second best time in the field.
However, in the finals, he went down.
He rushed to the top at the beginning and defended his leadership on the ground run.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his powers were lost.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton, in his book.
Later, it turned out that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bilateral mood disorder.
His brother Dan had made a year before I raced to commit suicide, and he himself felt tremendous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The county had no economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
He also oversaw his husband's acceptance of his activities.
The Favor Hamilton taxi was EUR 450 per hour.
He tells me he's spent his money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of the prostitution was also that he longed for the same adrenaline peaks as he had been able to compete in public sport.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from a bilateral mental disorder.
The life of a former star drunk came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoke Gun published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres away at the time of world statistics at 3.57.40, but remained last in the Olympic finals in the Baltic Sea.
The master of the world was amazed when the alliance set the Norwegian ski trail by "direct-backed".
The Norwegian skiing king Petter District has crossed the limits of convenience for at least one of its colleagues.
Aug and the Norwegian Ski Union have turned the whole summer and autumn into the ordinary sports contract of last year.
Even though the Union has offered Pigug a better agreement than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the multiple world and the Olympic winner.
The outcome of the dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and the Northug decided to close the future season out of the world cup.
The decision was given thanks to the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance was running a ski shift.
"Thank you for showing me the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the Union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and the Northug is about money.
Magug could seem to be part of the season of the national team so that he could promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to look after a union that will also look after future generations and will not let one of the athletes in his solos.
He also reminded us that the Union has given the region both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a different rules than just because he's the best.
The Northug published his own press release on Tuesday, confirming that he would like to be sports in Norwegian colours next season in the world cup as well as then in the World Cups and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, two gold medals, in total.
He was involved last winter in Falun in a team that won the media bill.
The stamp translators’ Thursdays are also due to be held in the Nordic countries.
On 25 September on the 25th day of the day, stamps will be held at various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Paster Converter shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food expertise and lower the threshold for departure to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
I would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but high-level restaurants, which are controlled and classified by an impartial operator, are located all over Finland.
The first point received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in the restaurant Foundation and Kantarel.
In October, the Old Town Restaurant participates on Thursday.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events to take place in the same day on a world-wide scale.
Finland will continue to be the host country of the event.
Kauhaki magazine: Appealed to the Chancellor for the establishment of a Kauhava reception centre.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre at the premises of the Kauhava ex-burden, now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region continues to operate permanently in the critical infrastructure of the banker, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Oy.
According to a private person, investing in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have an interest in the region and airport of the former Aviation School, the effect of which has not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the newspaper writes.
In the case of the Kahorava field, discussions have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
This issue has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (p.p.) and Secretary General Arto Rädy, Ministry of Defence.
The staff member shall inform the Registrar that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition from the reception centre, but of the wrongness of the planned location in the former guard area.
The Board of Directors of the Board of Directors dealt with the reception centre last Monday.
Soil: The situation in Syria is reflected in the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
The Board of Directors means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary circumstances, Niinistö comments in the evening to journalists after meeting with the Presidents of all Parliamentary Parties in his office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, a concern about the management of the refugee situation was brought together by all the participants.
He considers it valuable that Finnish government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the fundamentals in confidence.
In these days, when we face great challenges, we will face great challenges.
According to the Federation, the situation in Syria, as well as the activities of Russia and the United States in the region, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
The silencing is a hope for the development of dialogue.
If that situation develops positively, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to the League, the Nato issue was also ignored in discussions.
The president of the Bureau did not take a position.

Researcher: Sipilä is taking a high risk.
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's telephone and cell phones are one channel among others.
This direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This is not going to stay for the last time, Sipilä said reporters in the Parliament.
The pig did not yet want to assess how often the repeated method of the Prime Minister's telephone and mobile phone calls would become.
According to the wingman, talks may not always be broadcast on Yle's network in the future.
If other channels turn up as a channel, we'll see about that.
Here's what we're doing here tonight, Sipilä said.
According to the citizen, Finland’s economic situation is so serious that it requires that the public be given a telephone and a mobile phone.
This issue, which is now being discussed, is quite complicated and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä clear.
The speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 p.m. on both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Areena.
He's taking a big risk.
The researcher hopes that Sipilä's phone will not tell you about a more general introductory approach to the government.
Is it an attempt to impose the right of public debate on the right of self-sufficiently and to refuse to hold a public debate on the arrangements for questions? asked Professor Anu Koivänen of the University of Stockholm.
Recalls the recent comment by the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin on the fact that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow himself to define it.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koiväen understands that commercial media has been repugnant by Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting issues in democracy.
It is the responsibility of the media to make a definite effort to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken on board.
According to Kalivä, the mobile phone is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, he should bring something new and special to the table so that the exceptionally high expectations made available to him are met.
Is there any more we've heard available today?
Or is he able to talk to a different tone, in a different way or in a different way or to say or say something new?
Kikikönen says that if there is only more of the same age in the permit, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
In this context, the Yle will take the risk, if this is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labelled as a communication between politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in the interest of Yle or in the general line.
From the point to the point of view, the point of reference shall be taken into account.
What the Prime Minister fails to say will also be important in the future talk of the citizen, the media researcher will stress.
In the evening you should look closely at where Sipilä is missing and where she is not, says Heikki Heutti, research director at Jyväskylä University.
According to the moon, TV is a clever bet from Sipipi, because this is how this can bring out its own views without sounding sores.
This will provide the general public with no journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The blade passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong about the speech, because precise questions will not be asked.
According to the moon, it is very important to see how Sipilä is on TV - pouring sweat, shaking hands.
He's comparing Sipilä with the father figure, who's now telling the people what to do.
If you can handle it well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government knew something about it, because it is as if it is talking directly to another person.
Obama and partners regularly take care of (US President Barack) Obama and its partners.
Very exceptional.
Politician Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be a real exception to the public.
According to him, it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
An exceptional period of time requires exceptional means," Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wishes to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmailes ahead.
Employees' organisations are organising a protest and strike against government action on the line.
President of the United Left, Paavo Arhimäki, says that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would also be the subject of discussion.
Antti Rinne (sd.) President of the SDP once again announces that he will respond to the Sipilä dialogue.
We don't have time for guerrillas now.
Soon six months from the elections.
You can't hide in endlesss, Rinne is writing.
The son who was 9 years old has been on the run and has been found in Shera on the basis of a 19-year-old runaway.
The boy was in good condition at the time he was found.
THE BOY IS WRONG AND AS IT IS, the son's father posted to his Facebook page.
The internal Finnish police department will also confirm the case for the evening newspaper.
The kid went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later on, he was no longer contacted.
May Father thank all those who have helped in the search for him.
Thank you for your tidal contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildness of the young: You can accomplish it.
Makwan Amirkhani, a curated freerist, published a video on Facebook, which appeals in particular to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amikhani spoke out hard against the street fights of the people.
Amikhani, born in Iran and who arrived in Finland at the age of five, has won both of his trades in the most prestigious UFC series of free competitions.
My agency tells me that it received a message asking you to look at a Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account where young people fight with extremely violent grips.
My Amiga reports that she is disappointed with the wildness of young people.
Amirkhan 26-year-old has over 62 000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on the other side, and unmistakably beat without any of these consequences, which is what happens when you make these videos, my Amikhan updates.
Harder to defend any more.
Some of the young people seen in the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, the fight videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young Finns.
The fact that you two are fighting on the street at all.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, reminds me of the Turkish Amikhani.
My Amilahan reminds us that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a lot of specific cases.
A little bit, boys, he's defending you again.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for quite some time.
That's a little different from thanking you for being here, my Amikhan says.
My Amiga invites young people to remember their nearness.
If they ever get involved in some kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think a couple of times before you go along with him like that, guys.
My Amilahan says that violent action is a bet on racism.
You're making me hate what I don't even know.
You've got things pretty bad, and you're not going to cure them at all, amikhan will decide.
SAK places its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, tells us that on Monday, the employees' organisation will question its position on the alternative savings proposed by the KIC.
Lauri Lyly's comment on the proposal for a TSI is on-line.
The staff organisation STK reported earlier on Wednesday that it would present to the Board its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central).
President-in-Office Sture Fjäder believes that the Board will accept the proposal if SAK, RTD and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, this would require the largest wage-remuneration organisation SAK to soften its position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, on behalf of Lauri Lyly, commented on this subject in a vague manner.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that instead of capping, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement by the Government of Sipilä was not valid for the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä broke negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: The threat of being impressed with the feeling of a big smile is, "I feel it's a little bit silly to stick your fist".
I hear it's a little silly to stick a fist, if there's already a nice paper in the pocket, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmospheres vary from side to side in a pay camp.
Is it meant to call the government on the ground or to agree with it?
On Monday, the SAK's Deputy Directors broke out the sacred minister to the government of the kingdom.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to those who were planning to do so.
OAJ threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: none of the schools or day-care centres will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), president of the STKI, was represented in agreement by the staff headquarters organisation Antti Palola (sd) on behalf of the STK.
He announced that he had made contact with the government and that he would draw up an alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) for a 5% rate of output.
Mr Sture Fjäder (kok) was quick to announce immediately that his piece of paper had already been completed.
First of all, there was no word from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the Vice-Presidents asked the country to stand down on Monday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to produce a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity target.
Nothing is that the Palola RTD maintains its relations with the Government of Sipilä.
Jukka Iguus, the right hand of the Palace, was formerly Special Assistant to the Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi, who was responsible for the social impact of the RTD.
As a result, the fire said that the government's ay-skilling has gone out all the time.
Rain or no rain, but Palola's entry took off the floor from Finnish waiters, who were drawn by the AA Marko Pialainen (sd).
I'm telling you, it's a little silly to stick a fist if there's already a nice paper in the pocket.
Modify at 18:00: Added information about Lynn's comments.
The meeting called Finland a bad father: "This must not happen".
Russian President Sergei Naryshkin criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
In the view of the President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian Federation, Sergei Naryshkin, is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Ulan Batori, Ulan Batori, the OSCE's parliamentary assembly has begun its inaugural session, where Naryshkin made extensive comments on the July summit in Helsinki.
So Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to come to a meeting of the European Union - a matter on which the President took note of a reminder from the journalists.
According to our report, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again, Naryshkin printed the news office according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticisms were directed at the United States, where his access was not only prevented.
Sanktions are committed suicide from the EU, Naryshki reported.
So Naryshkin continued his visit to Finland with praise and praise for "a remarkable organization" by the Russian delegation in Myanmar, and Narysh also continued his visit to Finland.
I am sure that the joint assembly will be conducted in a constructive and positive way - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The management understands that there should be no obstacles to the parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (cok), the leader of the Ulan Bator meeting, who, according to the press, has already discussed Russia's delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff cover: "You're up tight".
Hits and Lõk will continue today in Hakamets with bullheads while they'll be on fire on the second day of each other's day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamets there will be no real goal parties to see today.
Patpara went to Kuopio last night to dig up 3-2 and get a job at Kalpa.
The rise was clever, because last season's silver team was at its worst two goals' loss position.
The lock on Tuesday was better than the cell phone win.
The guest of the Rauminen catch of the starter Blues, who took part in the game, was a round zero point, and the loss figures are also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any play the same game as last year, lock-on Janne Lahti is expecting to set up on the following pages.
The killing has become a fairly playoff nightmare on the rams.
During the previous period, Tappara has just dropped out of the Lock finals in the middle of the second round.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, Lõkko took a series to the end of the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next next side and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for paint guards.
The cashiers who fought both of them last night are getting a party today.
At the target of the kill Mika Noonen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the L Loop poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: In the middle of the day, a terrible play is under way.
Director of Sport Võola's manuscript was written by Head Coach Rautakallio in an inappropriate extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen in Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself played the main part.
The opening officer sensationalally set up a series of activities for Apollo Creed, the world’s world’s heavyweight world’s Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great deal of sympathy, even though he eventually lost his title.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola scripted the restless ashtray in the Pori.
The nameless and sturdy pottery went all the way to the MS finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, bottom-up defendants like Rocky.
There was a great Indian, Pori Matt and Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut off the licorices.
It's true, it's true. It's true.
JP Jalo, the speaker of the TV, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the buttery silver.
Reala was one of the heroes.
The author, Mr Óla, believes that this period's new work works in the same way as it did six years ago.
The man who works as the sports manager of the guerrillas has built a pot on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amors and Josh Gratton have been mutilating people in a faraway like Rocky’s pig carcases in a yard.
The merit of Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparise lies in something other than a reel game.
Alula has forgotten that at Rocky VI the main part of the show is Pekka Rautakallio.
The Kirri Stone has crossed the Sean Connery of Rautakallion.
In the context of the script written by Toivola, Rautala is as clumsy as the principal author of the main part of Connery as it would have been in the original of 1976.
There's nothing else on the rave than a nickname.
The play philosophy of the irony does not include rushing and small-scale translation.
He likes to play hard, but there's a different thing about playing hard as a pig.
Last month, the Ässien Garret Stafford was holding the Tapparan Jee at the head of the Karelian Lamb.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute.
All we have is those who deserve to play is those who play.
I don't accept that kind of game and it's not part of the holocaust, it's hot in Rautakallio agitated after the game to the people of Satakunia.
This season's team is obviously built up.
There are jerks, veterans, police and obsessives.
At the best age of the game, no key players exist in practice.
No wonder the head coach has chosen the skill equivalent.
How much have you been able to influence gaming, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last year's events involve procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather narrow, Rautakallio answered diplomaticly.
Surface under the accessories.
In the 1953st century, Rautakallio is known to be interested in becoming a sports boss at the Toivola site.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of losses on paint difference 1-6.
I don't think that's the point where I should've written the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa's mother too.
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband, Katka, as a teenager, you would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of his husband.
Yes, I'm doing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, an actor and producer Olga Temonen's laugh.
He has been married to an ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga is acting for the first time under the control of Võlka.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanto's You're a beautiful movie of us is the drumming mother of Sipe Santa.
A sickle tsamp and supports his son, even though his father Risto (who is represented by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I have met my true example of Sirkka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to the Flash that he trusted me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the project, but since then the two have drawn much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone and called.
The chip has helped a lot.
We've been going through a lot of different angles throughout their history.
Fortunately, I'm also aware that drama is drama, and the reality may need a little colour.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only person in Heinola who blindly believed that Helpla will be the largest in Finland.
There was a recession in the '90s, and it was a real duck.
There was quite a chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirka had some kind of instinct, and he was right.
Olga tells us that she had heard a lot about this young man before he was planning a project.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been very different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many people really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that known as Heinola's infamous skateboarder.
Olga was a everyday girl and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Froga.
At most, he could have hidden a crush.
According to Olga, for 10 years he has worked so closely with Hõkka over the years that a big joint project is not afraid.
It's always gone super well.
Now the entire production group will go to Heinola for one month.
Although a couple living in the village plan to drive home at night because of their small children, too, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take the whole Heinola for a month.
They have truly welcomed us, asked only what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 began to become Finland's most expensive drama film in Finland.
The budget for the Iron Sky film, directed by the Érosola, is EUR 17 million.
The photographs will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola is starting to film Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifi film Iron Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Combing Race, will be the most expensive drama in Finland all the time with its 17 million Euro budgets.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmar Helander's Big Game.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation will rise as soon as it is completed also by Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is more than EUR 100 million.
The pictures of the film directed by TERO Nõrensola and produced by Tero Farkomaa will begin in October at Aed Studios, near Antwerp, and will last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium already next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm so relaxed in the file script because I know exactly what movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that something unprecedented is going to be done.
It's so great to go to Belgium.
As long as time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited about it, and I can't wait to be shown to the audience of this movie, she'll tell Evening magazine.
The original film budget was estimated at 8-10 million, but the budget also increased as the script developed.
The budget is big, but it's a big shot, too.
However, 100 million people should be involved in the film, because each aspect and effect are so expensive.
Now it's all turned so tight, there's nothing missing.
Today, on Wednesday, the film production company Iron Sky Universe launched a mass finance campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final charge will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years after that, the company shall repay the loan.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junts or cools?
Big bugs come back to their shirts.
Recently, the fronts of the trend stories have been decorated by large logos.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious erect was waiting for clear and big logos like Crochea to match the console.
The promotion of a hood or T-shirt was seen as a bit of a jerk.
The times change.
Sport has become the right megatrand of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion characters, such as Adidas and Nike, rose onto the wave of coolness.
And so often, first of all, the bounds of fun and trendy are astounding: if something is right, it begins to turn into ironic and cool.
At first, the norm core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, in which the trend setters maintained as much as possible the most boring basic clothing as a way of separating from the mass.
Now, instead of turning on the gray base college, we're going to put on the bottom of the catcher's covered vertebrate shirt before which the logo of the manufacturer looks like.
The bigger and the better, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas, for example, is identified by track network software, the favorite team’s toy shirts and New York Yankee flags have made a return to the street fashion.
The bottom edge of the balconies is starting to be rocked by the Calvin Klein logos, which are now cool in detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace’s cynical extremities makes clear what the illustrious clothing is about.
Would you be ready to introduce a logo in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I was not stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, the Russian producer of military products, was held 2015.
Over the past few days, there have been colourful claims in the media that the Russian Security Department was forced to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to challenge the data.
He even published on his own public website a picture of how he appears to be sneezing about the brow of a armored vehicle in very good moods, and at least not based on their images, it's not about anything stuck or angry.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the battle cart, but it was BMP 3.
I myself am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, and Zotov said Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
In the exhibition, Zotov, on the Russian military TV channel, expressed his admiration for Russia's new technology, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
I was interested in what was inside the wagons, and I was fascinated by our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
In the following exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Hotov also called the supplier responsible a fool's ass.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing there.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but something about being stuck in a tank, it didn't happen, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov’s words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged crissiness have been published, even though over a few days a total of 50,000 people were present at the arms exhibition.
The claim that Zotov got stuck in the beginning of the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told that he was hanging out of the tank hatch when he tried and threatened to shoot everyone around if he didn't get out of the surface.
The Bloknot website later published a further story in which the exhibition organisers shared their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armored vehicles.
Mr Zotov, due to his large size, was simply delayed when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said the director of the exhibition Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilä mine of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The grubbing-up process water has leaked from the so-called liquefying sand pool into the stream.
According to the operator, measures to correct the bleeding have been started.
There is a foaming process neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water in the pool.
In general, water will either be pumped for re-use as a process medium or driven through a surface light field to the environment, in accordance with the authorisation.
The leak was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the operator, the quality of the leak water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
The rest of the substance did not pass into the environment.
The leak was detected on a checkup on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been caused by structural damage to the tank structure.
The Agency shall inform the Agency of any close cooperation with the authorities with a view to monitoring and correcting the situation.
The mine employs about 6 hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppa Mountain: IMF warns against cutting too much.
The Finnish Country Report, published today by the IMF, is largely following the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization set out structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be necessary for the whole contractual system and for protection of the environment.
According to Mr. Pasi Kuoppamäe, the main economic owner of the bank, Mr. Bank, we agree on structural reforms, but there are also few differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of positive message for government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, the sale of infrastructure, Kuoppamäki tells Äessanom.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects would also be in favour of implementing as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
IMF is forecasting a 0.4 per cent growth rate for Finland this year, which will increase to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, in its new cyclical forecast, Danske is predicting growth to be zero this year.
IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a small increase in total output in summer, reports Kuopopamäki.
Less attention has been paid to the deterioration of industrial confidence or other so-called softer measurements.
However, these differences only concern a few percent of the decimal places.
Nintendo, who was recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, working under Saptor Iwata, who died of cancer in July, begins work on Wednesday, Nintendo reported on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of a genuine Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Itata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to monitor Iwata's footprints, assesses Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to involve Nintendo strongly in mobile games, but in such a way that it does not eat company bread on the side of traditional artificial consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone.
Already in February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country will disappear annually.
This has been reported, among other things, by OSF.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear each year.
Juha Kanelma, Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear less than a year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum for a single underage in Finland were made in 2013.
They lost nine.
In 2014, similar applications were submitted in 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The disappearance may result from the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying for the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of full duration there.
In such cases, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, 134 of whom a decision was taken on the application because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so the missing adult asylum seekers during the last 123 years, he says.
The growth rate?
By 6 September of this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a single minor.
Overall statistics on underage asylum seekers who have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons.
What change has been made to the decision?
Do they also include, for example, "the black labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, the Ombudsman stresses the emphasis.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (cok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered applicants.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, the Orpo, who was discussing the issues of asylum at the EU-Secretary, reported on the issue of practical measures for managing the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkone is selling Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of devices.
As a result of medical incidents, the equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen, a media pioneer who lost his job, for TV and radio production is now available for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells in Huuto.net equipment that was once the most advanced professional tools in its range.
The first thing about the online announcement was the website's press release on the Internet.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer described.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interest in her.
The system, of course, is no longer up-to-date in this way, but these too are needed as long as there is a material of an old generation that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and personal studio builders, Nina Mikkonen wonders about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from the current stormland home.
There's no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've just started to take an inventory and see what stuff to give up.
At this point I started," Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no private use for TV and mobile devices anymore.
It is clear from recent heart attacks that a man who has worked a long career will no longer return to his working life.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now all we sell is goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, which was visited by representatives to collect films and other material from Storsky.
The threat of transport is worse than expected: Metro and trams can crash all the time.
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether they will expand their efforts in connection with a series of protests.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only on Friday during a demonstration.
During the afternoon, it is clear whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief Commissioner Pekka Horvonen says that the threat is large in the field.
The night and shift cuts are a lot of drivers, so the government's plans for cutting the cord are a source of resistance.
The horror wondered, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If metro and trams stop for a short time, public transport in the capital region will be almost entirely at a stop.
According to VR data, trains will not travel between 6 am and 6 pm on the Friday.
There will be no intermodal or long-distance traffic on Fridays.
Trains leaving before noon will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses remain in the barn.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3:00 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Most likely a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the authorities of the HSL, by Pirkko Repo, the editor of the HSL.
Repo says that HSL is not able to say exactly which bus shifts go on Friday.
Employees' organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Tower on Friday from 11-13 p.m.
Aftonlade: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees for tear gas.
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, reports the press agency AP.
According to News News, refugees have tried to cross the border gate.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under the influence of a panic.
According to the public media, the Hungarian police should also have used water cans against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, where the teacher thought that a self-made watch was a bomb.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested after the teacher considered his school-school self-intended watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted nothing more than to show the output of his electronics career.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock was like a bomb.
The police were called in, and the situation ended with the boy being taken in handcuffed to the police detention cell.
In any event, Mohammed has not been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had believed that the clock had appeared to be "movie bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of a clear circuit board and digital display between which there were wires.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohammed was punished for three days in prison.
His father is upset about the incident, and the U.S. Islamic Council was wondering if there was another demonstration of Islamophobia in the United States.
The president of the United Kingdom - Labour refused to sing a national song.
In a song, God is called upon to protect the queen, but Corby is the opponent of the Monarchy.
The criticism made by the right-wing press has also included representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people, thinking that the Labour Representative Kate Green was a public broadcaster at the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks that Corbyn should have gone along with the song.
At yesterday's memorial ceremony, the British Air Force pilots were in charge of fighting the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In his opinion, the Labour Party defends Corby and stresses that he has shown respect for the visitors by participating in the event.
We are all in great debt of gratitude to the sovereignty of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with reverence during the national assembly, and the opinion was highlighted.
The choice of Corbyn as the president-in-chief has divided the rows of the laboratory.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear to banish his moderate voters with their radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral extermination, end of saving operations and the execution of public expenditure.
For the first time today, Corbyn is scheduled to appear in the chair of the President-in-Office at the Prime Minister's Question Time in Parliament for the first time.
Corby has asked the public about what Mr David Cameron should be asked about.
Cameron took over the election of Corbyn as the president at the weekend.
The working party is threatening national security, economic security and the security of our families, and the Prime Minister has referred to you in his own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a trial.
The South Lake Kustonka Police have been investigating the death of a family in Minnesota Greenwood for a week soon.
Five families were found dead at home on September 10th, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, bru igh short, 45.
First, after shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead already days.
A family was found after being concerned about the absence of a child in school.
According to this announcement, the police went to the house to check-in and killed the Shorti family dead from all over the vast house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
The millions of houses and a successful company.
The case of South Lake Kustonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motives of the bloods are still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful entrepreneur and had created his property at the social media site AllNures.com, which is aimed at nurses.
In 2014, at the StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site every week.
I've had 50 bids made for my company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that in 2011 the Short Family bought a loony house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on a real estate site in Zillow for a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also eight garages sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a trial.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered different course courses, had sued him for comments on AllNures.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there had been no exclusion from the Short site from the pre-selections, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the court would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered them cake coffees.

The amazing gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest gift ever made by an athlete"
Canadiens Star P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital of the children of Juti.
According to the hospital report, this is the largest single donation made by a sportsman of all time to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract worth eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago with Canadiens.
Thus, the amount of the subban contribution is significantly higher than its nine million dollar annual amount.
For his donation, Subban will receive an open space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have at least helped local hospitals significantly before.
Long-term Captain Jean Belveau, who passed away a year ago, collected millions of dollars for, among other things, the same Children's Hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge sum of money for another city's Grand Hospital to obtain a PET scanner for cancer research.
You can order your wife for dinner from a coffee shop, serve the food on just a bikini and an essu.
The theme coffees are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat coffee on the market, a cane coffee, a vampire coffee, a fish coffee and now a wife coffee.
It hits the lonely, the feeling of association and the hunger of the hungry.
About the news, Metro.

Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the attacks on road data security have begun to be equipped for attacks against road security.
In addition, the Automated Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in this field, the Intel bulletin will be reported.
The city is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber safety solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of best practices on cybersecurity.
In future, the future will update the report on the basis of the ASRB’s research results.
The International ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimated that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Rare things are more precious than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an essential component of the design of each car connected to the network.
Rare things are more precious than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB panel the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in information processing.
Ford Focus RS pays approximately EUR 52 000 in Finland.
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car is starting to be in view in Finland too.
Ford released RS data now that the eyes of the car world are at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS is accelerated by its 2,3-litre, 350-cloud engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed is 2.6 km/h.
In Finnish, the price is also interesting, initially reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in his newsletter.
The favorite mark Kia presented two new brands - the new Sportage and Optima - at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition.
A new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to capture the ever-greater wings of the ever-growing street country market, will certainly be more important in Finland than two new new ones.
The new Sportage, created under the leadership of the Europe's Presidential Director for Industry Guillaume, is even more circular.
A centimeter has come to the door and the car is breaking air even more efficiently.
The power supply is broadly unchanged, but it has been supplemented by a 1.6-litre turbine with 177 power generation.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported in close proximity to sales.
We're still waiting for it, because the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
The new Kia Optim has already arrived on our land before a year's notice.
Look at the news, it doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of upper middle-class buyers with better driving features, lower noise levels and higher quality equipment.
Optims with a 1.7-litre turbodes and a 2.0-litre petrol engine will be created.
Next summer, the rate will increase as Optima GT, equipped with a 2.0-litre turbo engine, arrives next to them.
Back then, the sale of Optima Farmer will begin with its arrival.

During the three-year break, a singer who has been born has lost his pregnancy kilograms with light exercise and yoga.
The daughter of Chisu is about to complete the year.
The singer published his first single from a new CD in August.
I don't really care about standing up on the stage and standing in front of the public after a long break.
I've been sorry about everything that's been done with music, but the singer tells me.
Chisu will be publishing in a couple of weeks a new and same fourth album named Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new pieces.
At this point, you're wondering if people will find my new record, Chisu thinking.
Kim Kardashian's mother-style surprises me again - now she's on the chest.
True-to-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives the floor to one another.
She presents her pregnancy belly and her breast supply with her sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 a.m., when she left her sister Kourtney Kardashian's husband Kanye West's gig.
The mammary dress is open to the breasts.
It exposes the color bra under the dress in the light of lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian was dressed in an Amazonic maternity suit, when he visited his friend at a wedding party in New York just a few days ago.
The cause was highlighted by the black overcrowded boots.
The second special maternity dress is as fresh as last week's date, when the prematures included a pregnant baby.
High laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible.
The top manon Leloup wanted to have a quick idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary Spating Dolls (Speaking dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues speak of pure business.
The Harper's Bazaar newspaper collected the top of Leloup's hard-to-be-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go
Each season begins with nothing.
In the last period, you would have been in the top designers' costumes, the new season is starting again with skatings.
And every season, there will be a new, fresh face that will compete for work with concars.
The models rarely have a place to call home.
It is a continuous job to stay and can take a year to stay in a room or an apartment where fashion houses can accommodate their model.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be amazingly difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful jobs of all.
There is not just one type of thinness.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion patterns, models and designers are all the time together and act as the same support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is lame.
The models want to be in this sector because of its potential, but do not hesitate that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own person.
Work makes them feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models for Tory Burch yesterday.
In New York, fashion weeks are currently being spent, where designers will reveal their model next year.
Rope Salminen, who has changed his style, is making the most unknown assistant musician in the movie.
Roope Salminen will present Antti Latala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta Group.
The table was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase in Apulanta, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm presenting 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen, who turns out to be a 16-year-old guitarist.
I've never been able to see the real Ant before the description, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Anti is clearly beyond the familiarity of that crowd, so I think it's good that I'm just learning to play his music from a video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a person.
A man with a bullet in the Roope Salminen and Dogs band is not going to come.
The punk-maniers will come according to the man's nature.
During the punk period of the Stars program, surely many saw the first taste, even if he's ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but always at the full level.
In the field of assistance between 1993 and 2004 the main actors of the beautiful film you made, led by Tuukka Temose, who played bass at the bass.
The nuclear forces that have become known to the band’s audience are yet relatively unknown to the general public by young actors.
Rumbal Sipe Santa is presented by Tepo Manner, singer Toni Wirsta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen tipped off his coming nest last night when he mysteriously prepared himself for the most important day of his career in Snapchat.
Roope has already published in Instagram a picture of his new category, which he has had to execute for the film.
Roope, previously seen in mustaches and jaws, has shaved his face into siloposc, and colored his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees.
Many parents have recently had to wonder how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to discuss this issue, Member of the SPR Crisis Group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected and, for example, should not be allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they have seen, and it can stay out of their minds and worry, she says.
However, if the child has come across a television in the news about refugees or has heard otherwise, it should be discussed.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks for.
The children's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones your father thinks he is afraid of.
You shouldn't be afraid of him, even if he's anxious and afraid of himself.
The younger child is closely following the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child too will feel safe.
Major children are likely to come into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to discuss the matter with them if the matter concerns the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well at all.
Parents, together with children, can think about how we are dealing with this in our family.
After all, do we think that the world is a safe or a safe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
Second, if people talk about difficult things in the family, the child gets a picture of how to deal with problems in life.
This can be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker".
Your own powers at the end?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child.
The pallsalamaa that is hitting the vervain is difficult to control.
Perttu Pohjola was hit in the middle of the blow by Apila Ballosalama.
It only made profits and 2nds until, at the end of July, there was a collapse in the raves.
Since the slave left behind, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his safety for a period of time from his veterinarian.
The explanation of the passing out was found in the observation.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not from a mild end, but from the point of view of the disease, it required two courses of medicine to take it down.
Since Apila Ballsalama is going to be in light exercise, Ostrola says that it is welcome to surprise the horse’s last run.
It was in Turku at its record time another SE-tama after the Taruntõle.
The Apila Ballmill was very upset during the break, when it was normally able to drive for only a few weeks.
It was understandable to note that the slight bending to the end was the same," says the Northjola.
The coach assumes that a fair competition will make a teaspoon for the Ori.
The sound of the horse went forward from there to there in the future, and I hope that it will also be balanced.
Apilan Ballsalama has been so-called humor horses.
When you don't like it, it could've been thrown fat without the disease.
On the other hand, the secret message that the opponents have been wondering has been removed from the good days has been removed.
In the short run, the competitions won't be good for Ballsalama, which even gets rid of by warm-blooded foreigns.
Pohjola’s hopes include a stem run in Vermo.
However, there is a difference between how Apilan Ballsalam agrees.
It's pretty difficult to get started, and it may be able to sneeze under the boom of the van and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave would be better than Turku's departure by now.
Apilan Ballsalama is also able to come out of the head while in condition, and we're going to drive it to victory, coach's permission.
This is why you can't get rid of the empty iPhone software.
President and CEO of Apple, Tim Cook.
At least part of the programmes that come with Apple iPhone phones may sometimes be deleted in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will be able to delete some of its own programmes from iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: FaceTime calls, Magazine, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The latest addition to these programmes is Apple Watch, who became forced to receive iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple Smartphone owners.
According to the Cook, the removal of Apple's programs is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to something else in the iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems in some other phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
Keep going, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook your addition.
According to Cook, Apple is therefore investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste any memory on the user's iPhone phones.
The euro area inflation declined by 0.1% in August to 0.1% in August.
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly in August, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was driven downwards by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a few weeks back to 0.2% of the estimate is slightly downwards.
In this year, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called underlying inflation fell by 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for the base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent lower than one year ago in the last month.
In the EU-28, the average inflation rate in the EU-wide was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Of the euro countries, consumer prices rose most, or 1.4 per cent, in August.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest in prices by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent lower than or equal to the EU's harmonised price index.
The inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the target of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is well-known for 2% price increases in the medium term.
For this year, the ECB forecasts an average inflation of 0.1% for the euro area.
Next year, the increase will increase to 1.1%, with the central bank forecasting in its new forecasts for inflation at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is now trying to tighten up monetary policy.
The next United States recession will start at least after a year, but more likely after three years after the national central bank Fed starts to raise interest rates again for a long time.
And in turn, the bottom of the financial markets begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested to start buying-in of interest, possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Consequently, the next recession may be put at the earliest rate by next autumn and as a forward exchange rate on the financial markets.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and the financial markets act as they have been, and if they respond to Fed's monetary tension as they have done before.
The following conclusions have come to the conclusion of the extensive investigation of the long-term market and economic cycles of the German company Deutsche Bank in London’s market surveillance strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study Report to its international customers last week.
The strategies that have drawn up the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed is going to raise interest rates or what happens to the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to determine how the economy and the markets have previously existed during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical considerations, they will look at what the main variables in the economy and the financial market are now in the same or different manner as those at previous interest rates - and what could be the result of this.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more complex way to withstand the rise in interest rates than they were in the 1950s before.
At the beginning of the recession, there may not be a year in which to begin with.
Throughout the past summer and early autumn, the leaders of Fed’s monetary policy and its current stance have suggested that the time will begin to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate raise over nine years can already take place this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide its two-day meeting on the matter.
For the first time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, the relatively regular but at a time of two years ended the number of small, 0.25 percentage points interest rates at which Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 % to 5.25 %.
The financial crisis began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis began to be a global nightmare on the day of judgment.
The major recession occurred in 2009.
The last time the severe reverses between the financial markets and the real economy began to start at a slower rate than the previous Fed's interest rates have typically been the case.
Correspondingly, the sufferings were, after all, harder and rougher than ever since the 1930s recession.
The strategies of Deutsche have screened the growth and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950, and especially since the beginning of the 1800s.
Since the 1950s they have studied the interest rates and their economic and social impact.
At the latest, less than a year has passed since the first raise, most often less than three years and less than three and a half years.
The rise in the current exchange rate has ended within two years from the start of Fedi's interest rates.
Fed has in turn raised and in turn calculated his interest rate by a dozen cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has been different in some respects, and the coefficient is relatively limited in the review, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the result of the subsequent interest payments.
The policies therefore remind us that this time many things are different.
And not better.
interest rates too low too long
In the face of the crucial causes of the financial crisis, it may not be necessary to find out incontrovertibly, even by decades of research.
However, there are three reasons why the crisis led by the crisis and the causes that gave rise to its power of destruction must be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They found traces of a technokupla, and they grew up with the following.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive amounts of debt in the financial and real economy are increasing even more than the impact of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks on the general government.
The largest volume of the economic history of the month was born.
3) In particular, the craziest-bodied debt financing packaged in most areas of the financial market, particularly in the financial history of that year, gave rise to the highest interest rates on shares in real estate, securities and commodities.
There is no doubt that, in view of the increasing complexity of the debt caps, the rising financial markets were in a very dangerous and unstable position when Fed and other central banks were last driven upwards by interest rates.
Valuation curves, which were assigned to debt securities, did not last as long as they were after the interest purchases started and the cost of debt financing had declined.
Investments took place as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt.
Deutsche's strategies will not guess what happens next, but they will indicate the cause of the nuclear activity by referring, for example, to the following factors:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now held the momentum of their monetary policy even further than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis, they have now been even lower than they are before.
(2) Debt has not been insane for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now, at its lowest, it is literally cheaper than it is to express.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt has become much more severe than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been issued from one of the newest and least-favoured central banks has remained largely on the market and has slowed down the main types of securities and assets, at most at the top of the previous financial crisis or at any rate.
Not only are the strategies for the Latin atmosphere with the marks on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the United States economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in the decades to come.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak situation, but the pressures and risks of the financial market are equally higher than before the financial crisis, as Fed is next going to tighten up his money.
The future picture of Albert Edwards's strategy for the French company Socite General is not as strange as it may possibly be.
For a long time he has been training international investors in Fed's following translations:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the rectangles will burst, and soon it is time for Fed to move on to extinguish the financial points at even larger QE-rears.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs for computers and printers.
The vast majority of the reductions are due to HP’s commercial service side, the company reports.
HP will be divided in November into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which will focus on business sales and consumer-oriented pc machines and outputs.
HP’s staff was the largest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise employs between 25000 and 30000 employees.
Half-side reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low-cost prices so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company tells us that it has balanced its business so that no more than 10% of its operating income is held by any of its customers.
In the second year, its three main customers brought 65 per cent of the operating income.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked for the government of the tax-trade company.
According to Yle, the Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
Yle says that the company's activities were linked to the so-called tax scheme.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company appointed by Berner as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Berner remains a member of the Board of Directors.
Mr. Berner himself says that he has resigned from the notice of resignation in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the feed chain takes place on an agreed date, Berner says in Yle’s interview.
A union after the merger is a merger after the merger.
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a carpentry manufacturer, who merged with the Finnish carpentry manufacturer, Karlé-Upforor in 2012.
Berner was in the government of the Karélia-Upflor between 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Government and the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, the ownership of Kährs passes through a multi-port ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a member of the Board of Directors at the Luxembourg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the Government of Karlia-Upoflor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partnership was sought and found in Sweden.
This company is a self-owned equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s assets.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that its starting point is secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that the ownership of Hartwall Capital in the company does not involve tax management.
According to Berner, the complex ownership of the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, Triton, already had a holding company in Luxembourg ready for ownership.
In Espoo, a company-run reception centre will be opened.
The first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers will be opened in the Espoo area.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 people from this afternoon.
The number of places can increase by a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre at the premises of the former Finnish Rescue Department.
Luuna Oy, which operates in particular in the field of the provision of health care and care services, is operated by the company.
The City of Espoo, the Asylum Agency and Luna Oy agree together on the security arrangements of the Centre, among others.
RTTK prepares for an alternative work-life tightening package.
STATK will prepare an alternative package for the government's work-life blackmail.
The organisation also hopes for other employees' associations as well.
According to President Antti Palola, the attention at present is in the spirit of Friday.
Options for reducing the price of work will then come back to you afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will last after this date, Palola pointed out the organisation's administrative meeting to journalists on a break.
Palola considers that, on the other hand, the Central Industrial Union (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
The economic operators of the RTD have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's package of package of packages of equipment costs the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of interest in having a conversation if you're getting half of a relationship with 100.
Palola: The conference was constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) has wished for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is due to issue a communication on its own package to Parliament and start preparing for reforms.
The fire did not take a position on whether the timing was realistic.
The discussion with the government, according to Palola, exists and has been constructive all along.
In particular, the operation of Sundays in the field of STK, according to Palola, is a sick spot.
The organisation requires that the government appeals for an authoritative law to implement part of the blackmail.
In the RTDC, it does not heat up according to Palola to prepare an alternative package with the concerned SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose last week's government's work-life tightening package presented by the government.
As part of the package, the salary of the first sick days is reduced, the overtime allowances are halved, the daily allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced to a lower rate.
The STC stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to the statement of the protest and that the purpose has not been to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks you.
President Sture Fjäder congratulates the RTD's announcement on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to the Fjäder, RTD is now coming on the same lines with Akava, as Akava already has a longer outline of alternative models for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK, the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
President-in-Office Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare the proposal as an option for cuts.
Mr Antti Palola’s RTDK told us earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
Protects the security of change and the working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan informed us that it has long been preparing its own proposal, which is ready to negotiate a five-percent competitive jump for cutbacks as an alternative to the government of the country.
The plan has been ready for discussion all along, and we have long been working on an alternative model for a government presentation.
We are prepared to review the conditions of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want protection of change and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's affairs, as the RTD has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The scheduled Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the twigs" - plays bingo when Sipilä talks.
The Green Left of the University of Tampere University.
Viva bingok exonki from the Green Left of the University of Tampere for dinner.
In the past, the Prime Ministers have given a number of exceptions during Mäntsälä's rebellion and war.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks with great exception of the nation's economy in the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for the previous Prime Minister's speech, we have to go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud had to make a famous telephone call that marks the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The President and ministers then gave a number of telephone calls during the winter and further wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a new speech, instead of President Mauno Kovišto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976 President Urho Kekkonen gave up the strike of train drivers by telephone on the telephone.
Chatter, multi-disciplinary go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-
The talk of a pig has raised all day criticisms and guesses about what I'm supposed to be doing.
President of the United Left, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated that "Sipil could give his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would also be the subject of discussion."
According to the Green Ville Phone, "the phone call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the Erkki Kõja of the SDP condemned that "the monarchist mind of mines: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for them."
Antti Rinne, President of the SDP, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "It's almost six months before the elections.
There is no single presence by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was submitted directly by the Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and Jüri Hähämies, EC CEO.
The review has been reviewed on the presentation of the Online speech.
We considered the matter and noted that it was a public service mission to promote the whole of Finland's public publicity, the Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of the Yle publications, in the news.
Just like Me at the time of the Tammels.
The speech has also given rise to cowardice.
In the evening, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed as best they can.
Mommy's gonna put on a nicer bitch and Dad's gonna tie his neck.
At 9 a.m., we'll be quieted down to television as we used to be in the Tammello Times," says blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government sits in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital in their capitals, who draw up laws of mercy for other tax-governing friends and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipilä says, one guess is the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has been published in Facebook on the following bingo.
Do we ever hear of the same boat, common coal, life and team members?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 11:05 p.m., it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Achtaria Guard: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal for a deportation of al-Assad.
Over three years ago, the developing countries rejected Russia's offer by which the President of Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, would have given up power, reports President Martti Ahtisaari to the Guardian.
According to the Artarsaari, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan with which the al-Assad would have gone out of power elegantly after a while.
However, the third countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall elsewhere in a few weeks.
Aristaria discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Artarsaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed to him in a two-way discussion the three-point plans: the opposition was not allowed to arm itself, the call between the opposition and al-Assad was immediately required and the surrender of Al-Assad had to be done with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all matters, but we are able to discuss them in an open manner.
I told him what I did there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari recalls at the Guardian's interview.
Diplomatics do not comment.
Ahtisaari tells me that he forwarded the message of Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
The Czech Republic did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words for it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's arguments, but said that the al-Assadi troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all agreements in which they would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is of the opinion that Ahtisaari's speeches were poor because, according to his experience, Russia was not at any point ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting Al-Assad all the time.
The weakest thing about Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin, so that I could take it seriously.
According to more than that, he would have suspected, in any event, that it would have been Putin's rock to hold power with some al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow from our own actions.
Some 7 500 people had died in the Syrian crisis during the negotiations on the West Bank.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
Over 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster from happening.
The flow of refugees into Europe is one of our own actions.
All I can see is to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the magazine.
The asylum seeker's destination centre in turkish to Tornio.
The asylum seeker organisation centre designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the nearby Tornio Co-lysis building in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Interior has been looking for a suitable location for better management of refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the words of the newspaper announced that the Board would already have decided to propose a school facility as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Vice-President Sauli Hööppinen (left), vice-president of the Tornio Municipal Council, that is not true.
When the entire council was not met and some of the members wanted the official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 in the local discussion.
13 councillors opposed the Centre.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, Höppinen says.
According to CEO Nousiainen, the city received a notification on Monday, and the matter was quickly addressed.
The joint session could accommodate about 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is 200 meters from the border, so it would also be effective in that sense, says Nousian.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative from the labour market to blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium), half of the public holiday money would only cover part of the government's goal of calculating the cost of work.
However, the Government would be happy to accept an alternative package with him if the sectoral organisations succeed in reaching agreement on such an agreement.
Sipilä told the reporters in the Parliament that she had not been in contact with the trade unions.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for alternatives to the work-life blackmails announced by the government.
If such an agreement is reached, we will, of course, welcome it as part of the entire package.
The half of the holidays would be, in Sipilä's view, a means of working, because it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the Sunday surgery envisaged by the government.
The organisations could agree on a holiday allowance cut, because they are registered under the law instead of under collective agreements.
With these visions, the government will report next Wednesday to the Parliament on the blackmail of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to the citizen, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this happens.
The final maturity is not the same as the final maturity.
Legislative work starts then, so the train is moving and it gets harder and harder all the time.
It's a good time now.
It won't be long in such a way, if it is, Sipilä's voiced it.
The list published last year by the Board of Directors includes, among other things, the conversion of the final and the helitary into unpaid holidays without the exception of annual working hours.
In addition, the salary of the first sick days is reduced, the overtime allowances are halved, the daily allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced to a lower of 50%.
Reforms will be implemented as a mandatory law through trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the wage and salary associations organise a grand demonstration on a Friday, as well as several trade unions have declared illegal strikes.
The Board of the Board of Governors of Tohmajärvi approved an extension of the pharmacy’s warehouse.
The Board of Governors of Tohmajärve agreed to the extension of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the factory store, to be approved by the Board of Governors of Tohmajärvi.
The criticism was influenced by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the original one.
There is also a busy schedule too, too.
What was even more surprised that the order was not known a year ago when the last extension was concluded.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 sqm was adopted for the investment programme, but the financing will be decided in the context of the interim report.
The item was still on the agenda of EUR 150 000-200 000 investments, but at the meeting, President Erkki Ikonen explained that the price would be approximately EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and income to the local government.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment in rent, Vesa Population (ps.) justified.
There is also a place for the Karelian language in Joensuu.
The government of the municipality eased its firm position to bring Swedish-language street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
A new decision is important and appropriate, in due course, to maintain a tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu does not constitute the capital of the cattle's language because it has no historical basis and the language of the herd is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern savorian changes.
After a new decision, the city's centre will not be marked with a Danish-language street name sign.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on occasion, prepared to use the language of the herd, for example, in information boards and in the tourism market, for example, with good consideration.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other actors.
Although Joensuu is an official one-language municipality, it is worth noting the use of the cattle’s language now that there is a multi-ethnic culture living and changing over to North Karelia as well.
Karelian language is still a region's specificity, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole of Finland's forest capital.
Both of them can be well used to benefit from the wide range of markets in the region.
The endings of the train connections will cut the vitality of the region.
The train connections will strike the region's vitality with a strong hand in hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the regional economy and competitiveness.
And what seems to be the possibility of living and working here at all, is that the CEO of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points out that air transport, which has also been followed on several occasions in the report, has also been the subject of a number of reports.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not have the opportunity to decline by governmental measures, as is happening now.
The effects of these terminations of transport connections, for example for employment, should be considered, the Karjalainen points out.
The deterioration of the linkages creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it will be to have students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research purposes.
Recruitment Director Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market a university towards Western Finland because the transport links are at a cross-border level.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
They, on the other hand, account for about 10-20% of them in the U.S., which is partly reflected in direct rail connections.
Joensuu became one of the loud sounders for Siu’s soup.
The views of the national government on the regional Siu War project appear to be consensual, but there is one voice among me.
Mr Pentti Kessalo (sd., in the picture) of the Board of Governors presented the entire project to be abandoned at a meeting of the Government on Monday, but, on his behalf, it was unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the proposal for a decision by Mr Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the Assembly of the Governments, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all the other municipalities.
One trainee from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year.
Personal rail transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue to remain in the future, albeit less often than one rail couple.
There will be a change in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola in March.
One train couple is excluded, but still five times a day goes from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The caps are due to the State’s savings operations.
The purchase of transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quieter routes are completely closed.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March.
Boys climbed up the roof, one didn't get down, the guys slipped off the ground.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old who climbed from the helmet from the helmet, who would not have helped himself from the roof.
The situation took place in Tornionvu on Ketto Road at noon on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders on the roof at all.
It did not stop a bunch of boys who decided to climb up the roof of the house along the depression of its next-side reactors.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the others were sneaking from the ground and the passersby alarmed the emergency services to help attract the last missing person safely back to the ground.
The turnover of FedEx is fluctuated, with a stronger outlook for the financial year 2016.
FedEx released its weak result in the last quarter. The transport sector was weakened by the fall in demand for freight services and the increased cost of land transport due to the fall in freight demand and the decline in costs of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
The company's share fell by approximately 2.5% 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
The FedEx forecast is between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast is worth 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to the study of the FactSet, the analysts predicted $10.
Despite an average price increase of 4.9 %, the increase will take effect on 4 January. The additional charges for the transport of heavy or large consignments will enter into force in November.
The expected revenue growth is still expected from the previous year due to cutbacks in costs, increased turnover and growth in network trade.
The President and CEO, Mr Fred Smith, noted that the company has performed a very long-awaited economic situation that has been experienced, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
The remuneration plans for seasonal workers were informed on the day after the competitor UPS announced that he was planning to employ approximately the same number of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. between 90 000 and 95 000 persons.
In the quarter ending on 1 July, FedEx's operating profit was $692 million, which means a 6% increase.
The share-by-unit result was $2.42. Zacks Investment Research 12 of the forecast of USD 2.44 was thus left behind.
Turnover rose by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to the six investigators interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected at EUR 12.23 billion.
FedEx has in recent years been affected by the decline in international first-class shipments, which is why the company's Express Unit's operations have been burned in place.
The strong growth in the network trade has confirmed the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of land transport grew by 29 per cent, but operating profit showed an increase in the cost of large deliveries and insurance.
The unit produced better thanks to higher basic charges, while the revenue from the freight business fell because of higher labour costs.
About one hour before the opening of the actual trade, FedEx had a decrease in the share price of $3,85 or 2,5 per cent to $1,15.
On Tuesday, the share reached 11 % of the annual average and 17 % below the highest quoted rate on 11 June.
This year, the decision-makers of the U.S. National Bank Fed will meet for the most unexpected meeting in years. A number of people will sit at the six-metre-long supply table in Jamaica to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time in a period of almost a decade.
On the wall of the central bank’s decorative, two-storey meeting room, there is a mural showing the United States of America.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must put the State’s financial interests above all other interests.
The central bank has a order from Congress: maximise employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, since the major recession, the central bank's management has noted the third unrecorded mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be lacking in terms of a firm decision. On Thursday, the central bank is due to indicate whether the United States economy is ready to start a withdrawal from the projected benefit offered by the short interest payments at zero close to the end of 2008.
Although most of the data shows a steady economic growth, the recent economic downturn can already lead to the early onset of the financial markets being started by the officials of the Central Bank of the Central Bank to be alarmed by increasing the volatility by raising the reference rate for federal taxes — even by one percentage point in the quarter.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important to follow them in practice", says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economicist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co., banker.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank is looking for an excuse not to levy taxes, the increased uncertainty on the global market will give sufficient reason to wait", Piegza continues.
The discussions do not agree with what the central bank is doing, which in itself causes nervousness.
About half of the economic activities in Bloomberg's study were stifling the increase in interest rates this week.
However, on the financial markets, it is assumed that the central bank is expected to expect, and according to the main indicator, only 30% of the possibility of raising is available.
If the central bank raises its interest rate, the share prices may fall unless the creditors soften the impact by allowing a second raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was cut by 228,89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599,85.
"As a result of the turnout, expectations were that the central bank would keep the steering rate stable this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's main account of John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the Central Bank raised interest rates at this point," he said.
"If that were the case, the central bank should consider carefully how to keep the hands of those on the financial markets without shaking."
On the other hand, the other experts noted that an increase in interest could help to calm the financial markets and eliminate uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank was determined to increase interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step in tightening the financing conditions and thereby strengthening the recovery in the United States.
Yelle has observed along the spring and early summer that she expected interest rates to rise this year, despite the fact that the Liberals believe that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell by 5.1 per cent last month, which is now lowest for at least seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Wage income seems to be becoming more and more up-to-date.
Although inflation continued to fall below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, the central bank’s decision-makers found that the main reason for this is the sharp temporary effect of prices.
"The economy can handle higher interest rates and it needs them, as long as it takes account of the tight situation on the labour market", Pantheon Macroconomis, chief economicist Ian Shepherd said.
However, world-wide markets do not fluctuate last month , when China devalues its exchange rates .
Dow Jones industrial average fell by up to 16 percentage points from May record height, and investors feared that the economic downturn in the PRC would also affect global growth.
The market has become a reality this month, and Dowitter has now calculated almost 10 per cent of the peak of May.
The fluctuation of markets means for the decision-makers of the Central Bank that the consideration of raising the interest rate will be further complicated.
"The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened on the financial markets and the news of the economic loss in the PRC in recent weeks", the senior researcher of the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Central Bank Stephen D. Oliner observed.
He now believes that the central bank is expecting at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
“There is great uncertainty as to what will have an impact on the US economy, and since the recent developments in the Chinese economy, there is little reliable information about the situation,” Oliner said.
Global recovery is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
However, in practice, the central bank is the most influential entity in the world’s monetary system.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, the mere indication from the then President of Ben S. Bernanken that the Central Bank could reduce the scope of its operations brought about by revolutions around the world.
In addition to monitoring global developments, the central bank is also required to communicate with other central banks and experts so that it has a good overall picture of the global economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science", said Zachary Karbell, director of the global strategy of the financial management company Envestine In.
This month, President Jeffrey Lacker of the regional central bank of Richmond stated that the central bank had previously overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to the basic economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, who was entitled to vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, has called for the increase of the steering rate, which he highlighted as an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The economic crisis led the central bank to decide at three meetings to calculate the reference rate of 0.75 percentage points, although only limited penalties were available for the economic growth of the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Central Bank decided to reject the decision.
"The Central Bank should give priority to financial stability only in an important crisis, such as the economic collapse of 2008," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Rate Committee.
The last storm doesn't even deal with the situation at that time," he said.
"There is absolutely no reason to be afraid of the rise of chickens due to the shock of the market", added the Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act is still a sovereign and does not refer to monetary stability. I do not think we should go ahead with matters until this changes. "

The Brazilian Rio Grande Doctoral Association promotes a good diet for breast-feeding.
The Brazilian Rio Grande Doctoral Association SPRS has developed a blinding way of teaching women the meaning of a decent diet, giving them a picture of babies being breast-feeded, painted with images of non-healthful food.
Human breast milk is made up of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, so that the baby can have all the food it needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women due to additional energy consumption are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kg/day.
Research indicates that in addition to increasing the number of calories, other changes to diet should be made as well as to diet.
A recent study by Professor Robert Waterland of the Baylor College of Medicine revealed that the healthy diet of a pregnant woman can affect the genes of the baby and protect the baby from the development of tumours.
Unsatisfactory diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
Even though Nine is trying to get the lead on Today's Show, Seven Sunrise has the greatest audience in the world.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Tikinso were following Canberra to make a morning schedule for the subsequent announcements of the Liberal Party's leadership election, which, however, did not greatly improve Toda's ratings.
The Nine channel morning program was sent from the capital, Malcolm Turnbull, to Tony Abbott.
For its part, the morning programme of the competing channel, which was created by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was sent from London. The weekly special missions for the programme will also be sent from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance did not seem to have any relevance to the Australian television viewers, since Sunrise had an average of 397 000 viewers in five capitals of the state, and Today’s programme was 339 000 viewers.
Today's viewers rose slightly from last Monday (317 000) to Tuesday (2-8 000) but remained from last Thursday's figures (343 000).
Today has reached a distance to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average of 318 000 viewers, Sunrill had 330 000 viewers.
At the beginning of the beginning there were 40,000 to 50,000 viewers.
In September, Sunrise has reached an average of 349 000 viewers and Today 314 000 viewers.
This is an interesting event all morning.
The changes in the moods will affect more this morning than Parliament will ever have.
Karl and Lisa are fine, please ask questions.

Seven had an 800 News series with a former Packed to the Rafters Star Erik Thomson.
The novel tells of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children. The new series reached the highest 1 219 000 viewers.
Critics have doubted whether Thomson's hit series would be enough to be a single star, without Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
According to the viewers last night, the answer is clearly positive.
The Sevenin The X Factory maintained its strong position with 166,000 viewers. The series was well defeated by The Block (838 000) and TBL's Families series (726,000).
Seven The Chase Australia has been holding viewers on a wide-ranging basis.
The first half hour of the new series of adventures by Andrew O'Keefe (17.00–7.30) followed by an average of 46,000 viewers.
On the second half-hour (17.30–8.00) the number of viewers increased to 623 000, which was as if it were more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday evening, in the first half of The Chase Australia, there were an average of 520 000 viewers, and on the second half, there were great 20,000 viewers.
Hot Sea has a rating of 620 000.
The viewers of The Chase Australia's second evening showed Nine that Hot Seat would pass by at 5:30.
The Chase 02 replaced the Million Dollar for me, who was unable to challenge the McGuire series.
The case has originally been published under the title "Sunrise Ykkönen, Toca concentrates on local news".
In the opinion of the three finals, Sam Wood is really the head of the Dreams – but which man chooses?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Łoski may have accidentally revealed the choice of the Master of Dreams.
The final choice of Sam Wood, the master of dreams, has been a very well-protected secret.
The three remaining women will not waste a single word on who has received the last rose from the bachelor.
We asked about the sensations of Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before one of the triples comes off, and women could unintentionally suggest who will be the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed tightly until Thursday's finals.
All three women were fascinated that Wood was a perfect man, and women congratulated him on his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity, and considered him to be a suitable partner for themselves.
When asked who Wood would be the most suitable partner for women, if the last rose didn't hit its spot, their answers may indicate who would take him's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay after themselves as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Everything between Markay and Sam Wood has gone smoothly since the beginning.
"When I got into the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were well suited, and this feeling has survived throughout the show", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's a very fun company," Markoski added.
“I have seen them together, and I must admit that there is a chemistry between them.
They seem to be a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay is holding herself and Sam Wood as a good partner.
Mackay told me that last week at a hometown date that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this was not just a race. I am putting my foot in our relationship with him," Mackay said.
When Mackay was asked who Wood should choose if a man did not choose her, the woman in mystery answered:
"I can't do it," he said.
"I like other girls as much as you, Snezana and Lana are even."
Dream boss at Ten station on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m.
The story has been originally published under the title "Sarah Sam Wood Selection"?
Jarryd Hayne has several options for the NFL course's initiative.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne's change to the United States, and several others were interested in the man after the impressive open day last year.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some trainers would have kept Hayne on the bench, as a man in the ranks of the Australian Rugby Country Team. Hayne jumped the flight return team to win on Tuesday from Minnesota by reading from 20-3.
However, Tomsula showed confidence in Hayne and gave the man a second chance to return the flight kick. The coach held Hayne at the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in the dresser after the game.
He didn't beat the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he insisted on them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne at a press conference that was held publicly after the game.
49ers' special editor, Cam Inman, reports that Hayne was also encouraged by the Special Forces' Office, Thomas McGaghey, who advised Hayne to forget his failed arrest and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne will catch up, in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings, in the first quarter of the game against Minnesota Vikings.
Hayne and his Australian fans had been expecting another man from NFL debyyt.
Hayne left the field hundreds after the failure and later told Hamish and Andy, the 2 DayFM 104.1 channel, that it would not have been possible to imagine a worse start for the NFL career.
"They happen and have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error in his debut in the State of Origin series in 2007, when he opened his own area to Queensland.
The whole experience was still amazing for a young 27-year-old.
Hayne published a magazine photo where she poses together with fans and Australian flags.
Elton John and the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, are discussing gay rights.
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovsky, was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
Hodorkovsky, who was openly challenged by President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, Jukos, a man-owned oil company, was deported and his work in favour of democracy was restricted.
Four dead cops shot in rubberludes with protestors in Nepal.
Four people died in South Nepal, the authorities told me Wednesday. The police shot a gang with rubber bullets in the protest against the alleged new constitution of the country, a four-year-old among the victims.
On Tuesday night, violence occurred in the Rupandeh area, about three hundred kilometers from the capital Kamandus.
According to District Manager Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, more than 1 000 protestors had been gathered outside the police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me that the police used tear gas and fired fire in the air before shooting rubber bullets.
According to him, twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded.
It is not entirely clear why rubber bullets, which, although capable of killing but which are generally considered to be a less harmful alternative, suddenly were so deadly.
This was the latest roundup of weeks in protests in the southern Nepal, where, according to Madhes, new provinces based on the new constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in West Nepal, where the Tharus tribe calls for its own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are policemen, have died in violent gangs since 10 August,
The four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces, an important step towards a new constitution, but the subject is very sensitive in Nepal, where the administration has been centralised for centuries.
Since 2008, the new Constitution has been working, but the legislative acts have accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the Constitutional clauses in Kamandus this week, and according to the authorities, a new charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC Hurricane Centre: 60 % probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde due south of Cape Verde, 60 % probability of cyclone due south of Cape Verde.
From a wide area of low pressure, about 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verden islands, 60% of the most likely to develop a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, reported on Tuesday by the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) in the United States.
According to the Miami Aviation Authority, there is also a clear low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and the Small Antiques, which is also likely to be 60% likely to develop into a tropical cyclone in the next two days.
The company plans to make a total of 11 million dollars for the benefit of the refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced that it would launch a campaign aimed at raising $11 million in humanitarian aid for thousands of people fleeing war and poverty across Europe.
Google announced a donation campaign in its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of the leader, the campaign was launched by Google’s employee Rita Masoud, who told us about her own experience, who was only seven years old when she fled from Kabul with her family.
"We went on a train and bus in the dark and suffered hunger, thirst, cold and fear", Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
Following the shock of the European refugee and migration crisis, many families in a similar situation are in need of help.
Donations are given to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children's Society and the United Nations' Organisation for Refugees.
After the donations have been collected through the google.com/refugeerelief at $5.5 million, Google permission to donate the corresponding amount to the total amount of 11 million.
The crisis in Europe is worse then than the Second World War, making the situation worse, particularly the four-year civil war in Syria, which has led to more than four million people from their home this year.
Wars will also have to flee Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Mildly overweight diabetics may benefit from a fat-weight ratio.
According to this study, mildly overweight type 2 diabetics may benefit from a fat-weight regimen for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether mildly overweight type 2 diabetics are longer after obesity than those who receive non-operative treatment.
"It takes time to obtain the death data", reported Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity, who dealt with the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Fatigue, i.e. bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgical methods reduce hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective treatments for type 2 diabetes, but the majority of the studies have, however, concerned overweight patients with a BMI of at least 35.
The printing index shall indicate in relation to weight and length, where the normal value is between 18.5 and 24.9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight and the weight index of more than 30 indicates significant obesity.
You can count your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study or study, researchers at the Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 onwards, in a study comparing two methods of bile surgery, stomach bypass surgery and sweat surgery, type 2 diabetes treatments with mildly obese individuals.
The average body weight index after fat gain decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of study.
The weight index of those who had been treated without surgery remained in the position of 29 people who had received treatment without surgery.
The proportion of patients treated with surgery improved by 36 per cent and partly by 28 per cent.
In the treatment group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and in part only about 2%.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were also better in the treatment group.
Researchers also monitored patients with haemoglobin levels of A1c, which reflects the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin concentration of A1c is less than 7%.
After the surgery, the mean haemoglobin A1c decrease from 9% to 6% was observed.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged at around 8%.
However, the study group led by Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu found that this did not reduce mortality over a period of five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different operating methods.
In the fifth year in the gastric bypass surgery group, weight loss was higher than in the sweat surgery group (18,7 and 14,2 kg), weight index decrease was higher (7,4 and 5,1), as well as haemoglobin-A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %). In the control arm, the majority of diabetes patients (46,9 % and 16.7%) also improved completely.
However, according to the Swedish study of Blackstone, working at the University of Arizona College of Medicia, surgery will bring life years for fat people.
In the Swedish study, the probability of death of the obese persons undergoing gastric bypass surgery decreased by 29% over the last 15 years compared to the traditional treatment group.
Although no lower mortality was observed in the new study, according to Blackstone, it was nevertheless confirmed that persons with a weight index of less than 35 would benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important finding of the study, because it says that surgery is safe in the lower body weight index and that it does not increase the risk of death or kidney disease", Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should take weight seriously when the weight index is between 27 and 30.
"We are waiting too long for people to start taking this situation seriously," said the researcher.
"When genetic changes have occurred in the body of a person that exposes you to obesity and diabetes, it is really hard to reverse the situation."
"Not everyone can come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is not able to receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama has stated, and according to it, the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leading figure of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of violence in the refugees’ home country.
Dalai Lama discussed the refugee crisis in a speech in the United Kingdom. Dalai Lama gave its speech at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to the Dalai Lama, in the current situation, mankind should be placed above individual countries or continents.
He also stressed that although the reaction of the countries of Western Europe to the crisis must be admirable, it is not sufficient in this context.
"There is an impossible idea that everyone could come to Europe," Dalai Lama said in her speech.
Although Dalai Lama thanked Germany and Austria for their action in the event of a crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"The taking care of thousands of refugees is a great thing, but at the same time there are many long-term solutions and how we can bring about genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through training," the Dalai Lama emphasised.
"We must, after all, consider how we can reduce the number of killings in these countries.
Power needs to be reduced.
There are never solved problems of force," he added.
On the subject of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the action of George Bush in connection with the terrorist attacks of 11 September and argued that, when resorting to force in response to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks on 11 September, I expressed my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution would come through violence.
I know that his purposes were good, but he relied on forces with unpredictable consequences," Dalai Lama said.
In the four-year period, children had more than four times the number of cases of pain in children in four years.
According to the Georgian poisoning agency, poisoning centres in various parts of the United States are reported by alcohol concentrations in children under 12 years of age with a strong hand-in-hand intake rate of almost four times the number of cases in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian poisoning centre, hand-reported in children under 12 years of age, the number of cases reported to the poisoning centres increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are going to get first aid", Lopez told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink handmade goods for purpose, part to make an impression on their friends and part of social media.
There are teenagers in YouTube video who drink disinfectants because of cheap drunkness.
Tears are reported to blend in an disinfectant from alcoholic water to get stronger than a drink.
Smaller children may be tempted by the smell of hand-held hands.
"The child doesn't think it's bad," Lopez said.
"Many of the attractive handmade products have just been perfumed.
Handicrafts that taste like strawberries, grapes and oranges are available and appeal to children."
The alcohol content of the disinfectants is between 45 % and 95 %.
A small amount of young children may already be exposed to alcohol poisoning.
"The chemical alcohol content is very high," the medical director Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City, who was responsible for the poisoning centre of Kansas University Hospital in Kansas.
"No one would leave children with a whisky shot, but if hand-disinfecting products are often left for children to understand, they will quickly give a large amount of alcohol."
Six-year-old Nahijah Russell recently enjoyed four lores of strawberry-scented hand-holds at school, and the girl was delivered to first aid for treatment.
"The alcohol content of the girl's blood was 179, which is double that of the adult drunk," says Dr. Chris Ritchey at the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
The Nahijah sopers and he couldn't walk when he was brought to the emergency room.
Doctors followed the child’s room in a separate children’s hospital over the night for brain damage, for the girl had fallen and struck her head after drinking alcohol,” Ritchey told me.
"Your business was really scary," Nahijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products and disinfectants, in addition to the need to move the handbook to the children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some of the disinfectants are combined with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after ingesting hands containing toxic substances that had not been reported.
Health authorities considered that the product contained fatal methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported as an active substance in the summary of product characteristics.
According to the police report, three fourth-class students in the northern part of New York State planned to meet a "bad" teacher in January by setting antibacterial products around the room.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand and forbidden the introduction of it into the room.
The police considered that the plan that had been given was irrelevant and called on the school to take disciplinary action.
Huhumylly: there is no disunity in the ranks of Celt.
Griffith reduces the misconception of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that the team is not all right, but believes that you will be fine.
Hearts is against SFA against Neilson's punishment, and Warburton is warning of January transfers so that the team's unity does not suffer.
Aberdeen’s neck neck to Celti is five points.
The first half penalty for ADAM Rooney brought Aberdeen’s victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen’s five-point escape from Celtic.
Griffiths makes talks about incoherence small.
Griffiths has sidelined the rumors of the inconsistency in the ranks of Celt, according to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not being watched when they are preparing to face the Dutch leader.
"I don't think the players are waiting for us to meet.
The Dutch want an old Scottish warrior – de Boer.
The former Rangers middle field player and Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have found that the Dutch football fans’ interest in Celtic has ceased to exist because they are no longer able to catch up with Celtic and Rangers’ two-leggings.
De Boer, who works for the Ajax team leader, observed: "The Netherlands no longer presents the highlights of the Celt games. Why?
Because Rangers is no longer involved."
"It's not just the Rangers' return that we're talking about here.
We're talking about Old Firm.
Dutch people want double-hunting between teams.
Old Firm's games have an enormous excitement and are also of interest outside the Scottish border."
I turn the situation back on, Dela convinces me.
DELAY Deila admits that Celti is having a hard time, but the Norwegian credit assures that the situation will change.
The company that lost Malma fell off the Masters' League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celti has had difficult periods before, and we're coming back again," Deila said.
"We want our situation to improve as soon as possible.
The situation is very alarming and causes anger or grief in many people.
So are we, but we need to move forward.
We urgently need the support of Celt's supporters, as this will significantly strengthen players' players.
The spirit of spirit is now really important."
Warburton was the first time in January’s player transfers to Warburton in January.
Although only a few months ago, the Rangers boss Mark Warburton pointed to January's transfer destinations, he is cautious about the rollover and says that he wants to threaten the team's unity.
"January transmissions differ significantly from summer transfers," said the ex-strainer of Brentford.
"The team's summer-related players will be able to get used to the team before the beginning of the season, which this season has been a success for us.
The team is doing really well.
Incorrect gaming purchases can cause more harm to the team than they can do to the team."
Michu, a question of pension in Celtic's focus, is that it is a question of retirement.
Mr. Swansea's attacker, Mr. Michu, has been connected to Celti by voicemail, and Mr. Micchu, on the other hand, has suggested that he should retire after the end of the Swans agreement.
Michu, aged 29 years, has been an atrocious ankle for years and has failed to obtain a transfer from Wales in summer.
Hearts is ready for the SFA centre about Mr. Neilson's comments.
Hearts led 2 to 1 when Paterson was removed from the field. The team lost 3 to 2 at last. The defender's red card was later reversed. This is already the third Collum red card within three months, which will be cancelled.
"I didn't question the truth, I didn't comment on the performance.
Griffiths swear that Tynecastlea may be necessary.
Griffiths were reproved when a man was lobbying for his abusive songs about the former Hearts player, Rudi Skacel, who played the Hearts.
The incident took place in the pub in the Edinburgh Roseburn area before the Edinburgh local meeting in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"There was a local match, and the atmosphere was intense," the assailant said. "I can guarantee you that I will not go back to Tynecastle except for Celtic."
The Tannadice Executive Board believes in Dundee United's training management – Donnelly.
Simon Donnelly assures us that the Dundee United Executive Board can turn the situation into a better one, and the surrender on the field cannot be allowed anymore.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready to fight," Donnelly said.
Greys happy with the Hamilton victory in a dirty game.
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen was forced to sneeze against Hamilton in front of his seventh consecutive assault victory, or that Aberdeen caught a five-point neck in Celt at the top of the series table, which has been thanked for Adam Rooney's punishment in the first half of the sentence.
"There is no Cup- or hurt team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment is unchanged in Scotland, rising in the British islands.
The working standard remained unchanged in Scotland in May to July. The number of unemployed persons is 164,000. The total number of unemployed persons in the United Kingdom increased by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the Office for National Statistics, unemployment in Scotland was 5.9 per cent, while it was 5.5 per cent in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The number of people employed in Scotland is 12,000 lower than three months earlier, and the number of people employed is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell by 74.0% in the quarter and by 73.5% in the United Kingdom as a whole.
Scottish Minister David Mundell commented on the recent figures: "The long-term plan of the government provides the basis for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historical decision to maintain it as part of the United Kingdom.
The situation in the Scottish labour market has improved over the past year: unemployment has decreased.
Why am I following execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for the withdrawal, the execution will follow.
If the execution is carried out, which I do not wish, I will sit in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison spray.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through my husband's best friend and despite my shock, I answered yes.
In the middle of the day, I'll be terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you about the death sentence of the treasurer.
The angle of vision would be unique.
Suppliers will be able to observe executions in the United States, and since there are more than one place to apply, participants will be selected at Makaber value.
Oklahoma has reduced suppliers' positions from 12 to five.
The chosen will be the chosen execution moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip, and I've created a man's personal relationship, because we've been talking in a chat several times over the months, and one visit took two and a half hours and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often talk to our neighbors when we talk.
According to the prison staff, I cannot be present in the capacity of both the witness and the journalist, so I cannot bring in a notebook and pen to make notes.
I just need to try to get some details into my mind.
A Oklahoma reporter accused me of knowing that I was protecting the party.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a condemned story to him in a pleasant way, you will get close to him."
I presented my dissenting opinion to the reporter.
The journalist's lady noted that she could have made her words more carefully, but still thought that my actions were wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed on some of the things that I have said and written.
He doesn't prescribe what I write, and even if he tried to order, I wouldn't obey him.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
However, he wants an international supplier who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that the public will promote the movement against the death penalty.
KIM Bellware, editor of Huffington Post, will be sitting next to me.
If you need more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast broadcast.
I will not repeat the details in this context.
I can't tell you that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Trees would make him guilty of the crime.
However, I believe that it is very likely that Mr. Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I believe that proof as grounds for the death penalty was not sufficient.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I will follow his execution.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
An impartial description can be read in other suppliers' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was lured from Canningjo, Canningjo after a hydrogen police chase.
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry in attracting a man up from the Canningjoe.
An attempt by a Perthian man to escape swept into a shallow, muddy water, and a few metres away, the police got a man grounded back to dry land.
On Tuesday, Canning Vale police received a call about unauthorised stay in Beckenham.
On arrival, the police discovered a suspect trying to get the police out of sight by heading for the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water told me he wouldn't come out of the water and told the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavecia was not attracted to the watering of the uniform, so he chose the most appropriate tactics — consultation.
"Sometimes, the attempt to escape makes a person resort to interesting means," said Sergeant Castle.
The case of Governor Ben Cosins is an outstanding example.
In 2006, the Cosins abandoned their car in order to avoid a police fluctuation and tried to swim across the Swan River.
The man’s company was doomed, but the rapture inspired the locals to plan the Ben Cosins bithlon.
According to Peter Moody, the players tried to spy, and he prevents him from stopping competing.
Peter Moody blames Racing Victoria operators for the spying attempt last year. He threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody claims that he has been attacked personally by operators and by the Racing VAI, and the abandonment of Lady Tatai due to treatment recently given on the race day was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to act in the interests of competition. Moody was in a difficult situation when a cobweb was found in Lidar’s sample, and he was unable to explain the finding.
Moody has kept his tongue in control of spy charges for the past six months, and did not want charges to affect the actions of a bitter man.
"I didn't intend to raise the issue, but I was thinking about it for a long time, but sometimes frustration comes down every once in a while," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes have to react and accept the consequences, and I have to accept the situation now that I have opened my mouth.
I'm going to go home and sleep well for the night.
I want horses' owners to believe that I do what I can.
If the owners don't believe it, I don't think I should go on as a horse coach anymore.
I would wonder about my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped the bomb earlier in an interview with Racing.com, where she told us about the privacy department's spying attempts in her stable.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my stable to spy on my actions. I'll tell him at the request of the man," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe that I am a fraud.
If that is the case, they should be able to prove the evidence, for I have not been caught up in any of the promises.
Mr Robert Roulston, former RVL President, Mr David Moodie, President-in-Office of the RVL, and Mr Bernard Saundry, President-in-Office of the RVL, were aware of the activities at the time and now.
Should I keep the matter private as a chauffeur?
Should RVL take real action and assume responsibility for the situation in the field other than that of trainers?
Am I a shark for the sector?
Am I really a harm to this sector?
Perhaps many people think so.
I'm not sure if I'm gonna get a training license yet and push me away from what I'm doing, but there's no doubt I'm going to get people to think about what I'm doing with my speech.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore.
It's really sad.
I will press them to make their decisions.
My family supports me, and I can resign."
The long-lasting investigation of Lidar's coblon values and the recent abandonment situation caused the coach to become frustrated at the end that the man threatened to give up his license.
Moody is best known as the coach of the undefeated master Black Caviar, and he described the treatment of the day of the race as ridiculous after an irregularly set clay roll on the horse’s feet.
"The treatment is against the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"The person in my staff wrongly put clay on the horse's foot.
The clay treatment could have been done last night.
It could have been done yesterday, and that's what happened.
But that was the day of the race."
Modya can be expected to have a three-month competition ban on illegal clay treatment, which the organisers have begun to work out.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know the horse at all.
You understand that rules are necessary, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested fugitives from Cobra's crash
The police have arrested a man who happened to be a passenger this weekend who escaped from a crash.
The biker was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car crash at út Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning morning.
According to the police, the man who drove the car escaped from the place and did not stay behind to help the injured cyclists.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia registered with the Shepparton Police Department.
The man is likely to be charged with fulfilling his duty of arrest and assistance in the event of a traffic accident and other traffic offences.
A 40-year-old biker from the Assembly is still in hospital care, and his condition is stable.
Mr Craig Bellamy, coach of Storm, points out that there is a gulf at the opponents' button talks.
Mr. Storm Coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of his team's taboo game to be a target-hunt action of two leagues of the NRR.
According to Rooster Coach Trent Robinson, the judges gave Storm to the nuisance of the Masters of Melbourne to be upset by the defeating of the Masters of Melbourne at a court-martial match in Sydney on April night.
Coach of Brisbane Broncos Wayne Bennett barely covered a reference to Storm Broncos at the World Cup Final on Saturday night in Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and said that he did not care more about the pressure in Queensland.
Bellamy defended his own team's game of taboo and said they were just focusing on contact with their tats.
Bellamy added that her confidence in her own team was added by the fact that the two top team coach critics criticized her team. Bellamy considers this to be an indication of the fact that the coach is worried about losing Storm.
"This thing always comes out," said Bella My on Wednesday. "I remember Trent Robinson said nothing about the button when his team beat us 24 to 2".
I guarantee you that we have not changed anything in our defense system or in our technology all year round. The last six weeks have been just a match and a fight that has turned us over.
Trent has been on the job for three years. Loss could have been a shock to him because he has a great team that is not used to losing.
It is a pleasure that the same thing always arises at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett's interesting football, and she reminded her mentor that Bennett's St George-Illawarra Dragons won the league in 2010, playing boring football.
"Wayne talks about interesting football.
He compared his own team's Saturday game to our Friday game and considered their game interesting", Bella My said.
"In 2010 St George got a lot of criticism from his boring game. He said that the attack would not stop him.
Now he's got a team that can play so-called football, especially his young, fast middleman.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play along with him. Not all teams have middle-aged players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Huntin.
This gives me more confidence when other trainers are so concerned about meeting my team that you're looking for something like this.
Six months ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that at Storm and Roosters, more than was the case with Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven’t seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20–1. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are job breaks and minor interest in football?
Your goals will make it interesting for you.
If they catch us, we'll probably meet them."
The Storm has a free ride, because the team will receive the next Saturday, either at the Cross of the North Queensland Cowboys’ Cross in Sharks next Saturday at AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
A civil servant frees 200 000 dollars of bail for a drug case.
A man waiting for a life sentence for a half-life sentence in a half-pound cocaine holding company smuggled into Queensland has been released against the security of $200,000.
Marko Makimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month by the police for finding a 100 kilos of cocaine from the Solay ship that had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in the port of Comemer in August.
The police were watching the meeting of Maximovic and a perp on his way for the afternoon and caught two days later at the Comemer Road Coffee. A 40 kilo of drugs was found in the Tokyo Echo car in the park.
Although Maximovicia may expect life-long possession of the drug for commercial purposes, according to the man’s lawyer, there is no evidence that his client would have tried to take over the whole lot, but that he could have been at the cafe for an innocent purpose.
According to Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will attempt to escape from the country.
"The maximovic has clear contacts with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently", the judge stated in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Together, Maximovic’s mother and his father paid 200 000 guarantees, which were released by the man.
"When I read the voluntary certificates of both persons, it is clear that $200,000 is a real economic burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"It is not enough, however, to prevent a man from being ousted," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police every day and stays home from midnight to morning.
Stevan Hogg used the phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
The patient used an 11-year-old girl's phone to get control of pictures of children being abused.
Stevan Hogg took the phone while sleeping and logged in to an online message service where he got another user to send himself inappropriate images of the children.
Later on, the girl reported missing the phone and noticed it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When explaining the content of his phone, the girl who was home gave up alarming messages and immediately told her about it.
The police were informed about these five images, and after examining the computers found on the address, the police found frequent Internet searches using search sounds for inappropriate child images.
Hogg told the police that he tried to mislead the pedophiles on the Internet and that he proposed to the police in order to scare the pedophiles.
D.A. Eilidh Robertson, at the local court of justice at the Dundee Sheriff's Court, observed: "The man claimed to be dependent on people's intimidation.
He said he had made a search on the computer, but he claimed he had done so to look at the police and so scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about discussions with an unknown person who had sent pictures to him and to whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He told me that he had a lot of thoughts when he drank and wanted to look at pictures of rape and murders.
Robertson added: "When I found the messages from the phone, the girl cried out to her mother, screaming and crying."
You could see the unseen images on the phone, and then Hogg was questioned.
She informed the accused that she had used the computer and Playstation to discuss with girls who looked a lot younger than herself.
23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged charges for the possession of inappropriate children's pictures last year. Hogg broke bail on 25 January this year and did not arrive for trial on 24 March this year.
Defence Attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not be placed in the criminal register, as it may be considered that the offence did not involve significant sexual characteristics.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the closure of the judgment to October for background social work reports.
Hogg was granted exemption from bail in this case, but he was held in custody on other grounds on the ground.
Hogg was added to the criminal register even before the date of the judgment.
Mr Robert Mugabe is holding the wrong speech in the House.
The oldest African Head of State, Mugabe, fell in the stairs leading to the speaker's rise earlier this year.
Mugabe was not injured, but the video of the event spread rapidly in social media.
Parliament's openings were also rejected by the arguments of the opposition legislators that they had received anonymous threats of death, where they were warned not to give Mugabe a warning during his speech.
Last month, the Members of the European Parliament hurled and interrupted during the interlocutors the President's speech on the state situation in Parliament.
Innocent Gonese, an instigator of the MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), found that seven opposition politicians have received text messages which urge them to do nothing about Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message informs the recipients that representatives of Parliament are no longer within immunity.
According to the party's gunner, Morgan Tsvangira's leader party is concerned about the threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings operations of the business services business.
HP will be divided into two listed companies later this year and will separate computer and printer businesses from growing business and service activities more rapidly.
According to HP’s bulletin, the company records one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter onwards.
"Restructurings will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for a new Hewlett Packard", told HP's CEO, Meg Whitman, who will lead the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a larger and more concentrated company than HP, and we have extensive and profound portfolios of business that will help companies to switch to a new business style." Whitman said.
"As our own company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is more than USD 50 billion and the company concentrates on its mission to deliver unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s is now being divided into two. The two founded an electronics company in a garage located in Palo Alto, which is now considered to be the birth of the Piil Valley.
A massive restructuring of HP has been carried out in the process of moving from traditional desktop computers to mobile devices.
The changes in the second largest computer manufacturer and HP of the USA's largest technology companies are the newest move in an area where it is believed that concentration will bring success.
Arsenal Captain Mikkel Arteta: The team must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb meets Dinamo Zagreb.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshe that it is not until September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will certainly have to miss at least the next four national team games in England.
The biggest shame of the last problem is that Wilshere concluded the last period more strongly after a more bloated period and seemed to have returned to its former blade during the new season.
"This injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"He didn't get well.
This is not a serious injury.
This was just an insurance policy.
It had nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries."
This may be the case from a scientific point of view, but as Wenger said, further injuries may occur when the player tries to return to the field in the middle of the period.
There is also an unacceptable rule of law that is not acceptable here.
Premier Injuries Ltd. list 23 different efforts since Wilshere debuted six years ago.
He also played in Arsenal’s ranks only at 65 in total 157 matches over the last five months.
The wider picture of Arsenal is that since 2007–07, the team has been the second of the teams that have lost money for injuries since six eight seasons.
Wenger accepts a possible vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that last month's improved injury statistics continue to develop in the better direction.
"Some post-harvest return may be associated with a vulnerable period of time for strengthening the body and seeking competition powers," Wenger said.
"Jack is young, so he'll get away with it.
I hope he gets his body balanced, and I believe in it, and it will lead to his career being made in the way he deserves."
Arsenal will start his work on the Masters League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. After that, the team will meet up with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger will prepare some changes to the composition.
Subject Bellerín and Aaron>>eng<<sey have not lived in Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be the beginners.
Wenger can also set up an initial meeting to replace Kieranţ and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give it time to people who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear favorite for the F Group's supporter, there are Europe's scariest stadiums in Maksimir Zagreb.
Dinam has also been undefeated during the 41th game of the team.
The shop was shaking on Tuesday night when the earth was shaking at a force of 3,2 on the Richter scale.
The quake was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson of the last period since he was forced to bend to Monaco, who was still motivated by a far-reaching desire to create a team towards the European Championship.
"We have a natural energy charge," Wenger said.
"The Arsenal has not yet been hit by this title.
We were very close in 2006.
We are ambitious but not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us the truth about friendship between men.
A similar description shines with its absence in other categories, which is remarkable, especially given the fact that men are more likely to open up than ever, and older men’s suicide statistics are no more than 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom. The suicide is three times more common among men than among women.
Campaign Aginst Living Miserably (CALM) is taking over the problem by the 2015 men's year. The campaign seeks to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the assistance they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
In a recent study, 2,000 high school students were interviewed, and according to the study, the chances of healing those who suffer from depression symptoms are better if there are enough healthy people around them.
Also, the likelihood of asymptomatic persons getting sick was expected to be reduced if there were people around who have no mental health problems.
However, the basis of the whole process is the relationship.
Modern communication is dominated by social media, and communication is often more important than the current media. Rapid communication is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need seems to be strong, fun and successful doubled, even though isolation is a reality.
The external values, money, image and social status associated with earthly success, all of which pay attention to our inner values and our desire for personal growth and brightness. Internal values will have a deeper impact on our mental health.
A millionaire in the video game industry recently found that money really cannot buy happiness.
The fineness of the French was therefore that the series turned the main focus on the top.
None of the characters in the series are defined by profession, but by the spirit, which was seen in a spirit.
The series was humorously shown by Joey and Chandler hugging or watching football with their TV chairs, and we also saw Rossi often in the interest of Rachel. It was clear that men were able to identify with this even though they did not keep to know him fully.
One volunteer worker explained to me this: "When I hear people who are depressed and concerned about suicide, it has become clear to me how much even the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
The men who contact us are often unable to speak again.
The traditional idea that men should take care of themselves is strong, and that they find it easy to treat them as weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frends is one of the series containing long-term survival mechanisms.
The small moments of friendship between men were highlighted in the series.
Through the call, I can provide help from the outside at a moment of despair, but long-term support is provided by friends and family."
In honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the series's accessories have been restored to life. So if you are taking part this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk for coffee.
Or do something even better. Smile and say hello if you see anyone sitting alone in Starbucks at the Starbucks.
You never know how important a atmosphere can be about it.
Comedy Central will send the whole Frentit series – all 236 episodes – #FriendsFest in honor of the WorldsFest.
Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmö.
Angel Di Maria invites Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan to meet Malmö after he has made a paint against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting the Masters' league debut and helped PSG hit the Swedish team Malmo on Tuesday.
Read the history and evaluation of the event.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were hit when St. Germain started his job at the Masters' League by hitting Malmön Parc desURs Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the British champions in the immediate handshake. However, the PSG was stunned by several goals before they were able to add to the lead: Cavani painted after the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A-block also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish master. PSG is not only aiming for a follow-up in the playoffs, it also wants to improve its position for the quarters in the three remaining matches.
Even if the SPG caught the score, the match was not the perfect show of a team piloted by Mr. Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his goalie and he was replaced when he faced his former homecoming, where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win the champion's league at home or in guests, so the 2-0 victory and the good take-up provide a good basis, even though we still have enough time to make it," said Blanc.
"This knows good.
We were thirsty to win, and we were able to do it, but I'm sorry we couldn't do it together or two more."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team after he was injured. The team had to settle for 2-2 games this weekend in the Ligue 1 series against Bordéx. Di Maria did leave Ibrahimovic behind in four minutes.
Last month, the Argentinian platform from United States to PSG was designated as the PSG solver to raise the team to a new level in Europe. He proved to be a title worthy of praise for the input of the ball Marco Compare past Malmö's defense and then set the exact goal at the rear of the target right by Wiland.
However, those who were expecting PSG to break down were disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celt in the playoffs, marched into the field nine international players from the start. The five-man defense and the team playing with two-attack tactics were difficult to win.
The shot at Nikola Djurdjic went through the back of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute of the game. The team did not attack very closely.
On the other hand, the PSG fell into unnecessary feeding and weak finishing, and not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five destinations only in the first half. Right at the beginning of the second half, Ibrahimovic's fire fed the paint on the rifts of Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his nails in the power game. Ibrahimovic's pitched Di Maria shot a twist of kick in Wiland's past 52 minutes.
Another goal was created during the crepe of Cavan. Six years through him, a playful Los Angeles shot a full-time shot when Ibrahimovic fed him his left-hand bat for Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's letter ended with another paint, and only Wiland's top anti-theft David Luiz close to shooting was kept in check, and Ezequiel Lavez's paint was abandoned on the very end of the lakes.
Malmö created Åge Hareide afterwards that PSG was his own category. "We played the last Masters League game last December.
Since then, we have only been playing in the Swedish league where the level is not the same.
Creeps are not enough.
Complaints to the Parisians.
This was a top-up from them."

I don't think he'll stay here any longer to find out.
He's just satisfied with his performance.

Britten is a great guy who matters to the family.
His own child and his wife consider him to be a hero.
Gaff told me that since he didn't win himself, he would prefer to win just Isaac.
