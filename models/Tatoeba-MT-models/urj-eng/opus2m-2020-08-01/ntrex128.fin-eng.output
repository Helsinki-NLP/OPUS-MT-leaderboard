Members of the Wales delegation fear that they will seem foolish.
Some members of the delegation are confused by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP, a Member of the Wales Parliament (member of the Welsh Parliament).
Hyu began to plan to convert the name of the delegation into the parliament of Wales.
Members of the delegation, regardless of the political list, are concerned that the change may cause them to be mocked.
According to one working party representative, the group is concerned about the fact that the name "in line with the words Twp and Pwp" is "in line with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means poop.
According to one Party representative, a majority of the group "not satisfied" and has proposed other options.
According to a conservative party representative, his group is "in a more open mind," but points out that the MWP word is a simple word for word.
In Wales's language, w-words are written in the same way as in Yorkshire's English letter U-mail.
The Commission of the delegation which is currently drawing up the legislative amendment necessary to change the name stated as follows: "The final decision on the headings of the members of the delegation shall, of course, be for the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 on Public Administration empowers the delegation to change its name.
In June, the Commission published an opinion on the proposals, according to which the appointment of a delegation for the Assembly of Wales enjoyed broad support.
The Commission favours the title of members of the delegation as Members of the Wales Parliament or abbreviation WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in the public opinion poll.
The members of the delegation are likely to propose alternative headings, but the lack of consensus may cause a headache to President Elin Jones, who is expected to be subject to changes in the legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The legislation on changes also includes other changes to the functioning of the committee, such as the act of representation and the rules governing the form of the committee system.
For the purposes of legislative discussion, members of the delegation may make their last vote on the title to which they should be invited.
The citizens of the country go to the courts by a referendum on changing the name of the country.
On Sunday, the voters will vote on whether the name of the country will be changed to "the Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The aim of the referendum is to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which also has its own country called Macedonia.
Athenia has long reiterated that the name of the Northern Neighbour is, in fact, a regional requirement for its territory, and has repeatedly opposed its membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Mr Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to a referendum, has said that he will abstain from voting.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply a price to be paid by EU and NATO members.
The watches of St. Martins will remain silent when the Harlem churches live difficult times.
"The older people I've been talking to say that before each corner of the street there was a bar or a church," says Adams.
"Now there is neither."
He said that losing a bar was understandable.
He said, "The interaction of people has changed."
"Bars are no longer the common living rooms of the neighborhood, to which people meet regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the sale of property does not take place as much as the leaders imagine, "and sooner or later they have returned to the origin box."
He added that churches can be replaced by housing houses and apartments that people living in are not the ones who would support the remaining churches in the neighbourhood.
"The most people who buy housing from these buildings will be white," he says, "and thus they will delay the day when these churches will finally close their doors, because it is unlikely that most people who move to these houses will become part of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins a year later.
The original White Jewish Church moved out in the 1930s.
The nearby black-hospital church acquired ownership of the building.
St Martins took over the Black Church under the leadership of Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led the boycotts against the traders of 125th Street, the main commercial street of Harlem, in opposition to the hire or promotion of black people.
The fire that started in 1939 seriously damaged the building. When Father Johnson’s parishes designed the reconstruction, they introduced a tower tower sign.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor of St. Martins, called the tower bell a "poor bell."
An expert who called on a tortoise game in July called it "cultural" and "unreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at Michigan University, also noted that this was the world's first tower game played by a black-skinned musician, which was Dionio A. Lind, who moved the larger tower-roller to the RIS church 18 years ago.
According to MerriWeather, St. Martins did not replace him.
In St. Martins, a complex zone has developed in recent months, involving architects and contractors hired by the church’s laymen’s leaders and, on the other hand, by the episcopal coup d’état.
Sausage - a body consisting of congregation laymen - wrote to the skiing company in July about the fact that the skiing company would "switch the costs" to the Sasac, even though it had not contributed to the hire of architects and contractors sent by the skiing company.
Some congregationers chose to have a lack of knowledge about the divinity of the church.
The shark damaged a 13-year-old hummel-supervisor in California.
The authorities report that the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him when the boy dived lobsters on the opening day of the lobster in California.
The attack took place at Beacon's in Encinitas just before dawn seven.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV about half an hour ago with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help. He and a group of others were hovering towards the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel told him that he thought at first that he was only excited to catch a lobster, but then he realized that he shouted, "I was bitten!"
Let's go!'
After getting to the boy, Hammel says that he noticed that this whole collarbone had been torn open.
"I called everyone out of the water: There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is reported to be critical.
The occurrence of the attack shark is not known.
In the media conference, Captain Larry Giles said that sharks had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but were found to be a harmless species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered serious injuries to his upper arms.
The authorities closed the beaches from Casablad’s Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Mr Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them were considered harmless.
Sainsbury's will be hosted by the United Kingdom beauty service.
Sainsbury's challenge is for Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams freight-style beauty services with expert advice.
This is a major business for the UK’s 2.8 billion-pound beauty service, which will continue to grow, even if sales of fashion and household goods are falling. Larger beauty departments will be tested in 11 stores around the country and will be successfully extended to other stores next year.
The products are placed in beauty care products because the supermarkets are seeking to fill a shelf that had previously been reserved for televisions, microwaves and household articles.
Sainsbury's reports that its range of beauty care products doubles with 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweetzerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees also receive more space and receive their own brand brands in the manner of Boots stores in their region.
The super brand also re-launchs its Boutique game selection. In the future, most products will continue to be vegan-friendly, as young shoppers increasingly demand it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop has been experimenting with rental stores in the Sainsbury's store. The first was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second one will be opened in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Buying-outs and moving shopping to small parallel auctiones force supermarkets to come up with new challenges for customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will look more and more like stores when the supermarket chain struggles against cheap stores such as Ald and Lidl by increasing services and non-food products.
After purchasing both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores and, in addition, Hatitat stores. The company reports that this led to the sale of food and made the purchases profitable.
The supermark failed in its previous company to reform its beauty management and care departments.
Sainsbury's tried the joint venture with Boots in the early 21st century, but the cooperation ended with a dispute as to how the yields of the supermarkets should be distributed.
The new strategy follows a transaction where Sainsbury's sold 281 stores to the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, Celesi 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company told me Lloyds is part of a plan where four shops are extended to a range of generic care products such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the appearance and atmosphere of our beauty department to improve the customer experience.
We have also invested in highly trained workers who are ready to advise customers.
Our selection of brands responds to all our needs and attractive environments, and our convenient location makes us a convincing shopping destination for beauty care, which challenges the traditional way of shopping."
Holding back £11 million on Holly Willoughby's back after he's done 11 million pounds.
The Dragons Den star Peter Fj left in his "rare" when the TV-trainer Holly Willoughby withdrew 11 million pounds from the deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their home product and home brand Truly.
The two companies are located in the Võu Gwyneth Patrowin Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of this Morning program announced that he had left the country.
Holly Willoughby pissed off Dragons Den by Peter Jones’s withdrawal from their profitable lifestyle business last minute. He is now going to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources tell us that Jones was in the 'rare' meeting last Tuesday at the head office of the Jones Business Empire in Marlow, Buckinhamshir. The stargirl of TV had admitted that his new 1.5 million-pound contract would not leave enough time for their home-food and home-mark Truly.
The company has a Gwyneth Paltrwin Goop brand and was bet on around 11 million pounds of assets by double Willoughby.
According to Willoughby, 37-year-old Willoughby, who left Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source: "Truly was Holly's most clearly most important project.
It was his long-term plan to ensure his survival for the next two decades.
His initials have left everything in the power of surprise.
No one could believe Tuesday’s events so close to the publication.
Marlow's headquarters has a store full of products for sale.
This Morning is one of the most secure British stars, and his departure may, according to the experts, cause a million losses to the company due to investment in products, which includes all pillow candles and clothing for home supplies, not to mention the delay of publication.
It could mean the end of a long time's reign.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin, his wife, have been close for ten years with Hui and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby organized Capp Truly in 2016 and from the age of 52, Jones took over the chair in March.
Couples are on vacation together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV company.
Willoughby is the new brand ambassador for M&S and he replaces Ant McPartlin as the director of the I'm A Celebrity programme for ITV by I'm A Celebrity.
The source close to the district said last night, "we did not comment on his business.
A lot of talk and then we fell in love.
He was making fun of the criticisms that would be received in the media from his comments which he thought were inappropriate to the President and welcomed with regard to the Director of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump told me that he was pretending to be a "new cousin".
"I didn't give up on anything.
He noted that Kim was interested in meeting again after Trump had glowed the first meeting of July as an important step towards nuclear separation in North Korea.
However, nuclear negotiations have been collapsing.
Over three months after the Singapore Summit in July, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see the United States’ "equivalent response" to early North Korea’s disarmament activities.
On the contrary, he said that the United States should continue its sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
The best man had a much more optimistic view.
"You're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"We were in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be dead.
Now we have such an excellent relationship.
According to him, efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results.
He also defended his unusual mood for talking about his relations with Kim.
"It is very easy to be presidential, but instead of trying to reach 10 000 more outside this precision, we would have about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, showing the audience directly ahead of us.
In Indonesia, the tsunami and the earthquake destroyed the island, hundreds of dead people.
For example, several foreign voluntary organisations were told that there was no need for them in the following elements of the Lombo earthquake:
The national emergency for international assistance was not declared, although about 10 per cent of the inhabitants of Lombok had remained homeless.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so the situation is a bit challenging," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is a group traveling to the Fire, it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on the field.
The National Emergency Agency Officer Sutopo said that the Indonesian authorities would assess the situation Please, see whether the participation of international organisations is allowed to participate in the work of assistance.
Indonesia remains unfortunately prepared to face the natural forces, taking into account the repeated earthquakes on a regular basis.
Despite the construction of tsunami protection in Acehi, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The fire was likely to be lost due to a missing tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is challenging even under the best of circumstances.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
In order to help the victims of the Lombo earthquake, the port ship is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach a new area of accident.
President Widodo made an election campaign for the development of the infrastructure in Indonesia at the centre of his election campaign, and he has allowed money to improve the roads and railways.
However, the financial deficit has been working for each administration, while the new elections are approaching next year.
Many pressures also increase tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority in the country has formed a more old-fashioned form of religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs have fought street battles with jungle knives, bows and arrows, as well as with other primitive weapons, which has resulted in more than 1,000 people killed, and tens of thousands have left their homes.

The Indonesian emergency department reported early on Sunday that the earthquake and the death of the tsunami were up to 832 victims.
In the press conference Sutopo Purwo reported that many had been trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, when the 7.5-magnetic earthquake struck this evening and raised waves up to six feet [6 m] high.

The police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of being murdered after finding a woman stabbed to death.
The body of a woman found in Birkenhead Merseyside this morning initiated a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 at Grayson Mews on John Street, a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
Police call on the police to report to the police if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at its origins, but I call on all those in nearby John Street Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also call on all of you, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the machine video, to contact the police, who may have vital information for the investigation.
A police officer has confirmed that the woman who was found dead is from Birkenhead, and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, a woman may have become aware of the crime scene who has asked about where she was found.
In the course of the investigation, the police report that they are seeking to inform the victim of what happened close to the victim.
The taxi driver in Grayson Mews had just tried to get back to home, but the police had told me that no one would let you in or out of the building.
He was speechless to know what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it can take hours to get them back in.
One officer was consulted to inform the man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
There was a newspaper lady at the scene of the event.
He repeated again that "it's terrible.

Parliament's Cromwell statue became part of the history of the rewrite piece of Parliament's Cromwell statue.
The deportation of the palace would indeed be a poetic right, given that his own fanatical puritanists destroyed British and religious monuments as well as the best Talibans.
The Cromwell Association, however, described Crick's proposal as "type-of-the-art" and "rewriting history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the forthcoming debate on the removal of the statues would make the destination of the Oliver Cromwell statue at the front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or perform iconoclasms of British civil wars.
False Cromwell may have to suffer from the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's wonderful description of Cromwell reflects the opinions of the 19th century and it is historical evidence of a character that many still value praise.
Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, although perhaps more than in the 1800s than today, Cromwell is being held by Parliament's defender against the external pressure which, of course, in this case, monark is responsible for.
Is this an accurate description of the subject being the subject of an ongoing historical debate?
It is certain, at least, that the debate in the mid-600s has shaped the future development of our nation. Cromwell in turn must identify a character representing the other half of that division.
In addition, his achievements as a head office deserve praise and recognition."
The killer's cocksaw was found dead by a Chinese farmer.
The local media are telling the pig that attacked the farmer and killed him on this market in South-East China.
The body of a man identified as "Yua" was found only in the area near Liupanshu Square in the Province of Guizhou, where the man had lost his domain and was covered in blood, reports South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The sister-in-law is preparing to vaccinated pigs in a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai, China, on 30 May 2005 in Xining, the province of Qinghai, on 30 May 2005.
On Wednesday, with its sent-in cousin, news was posted from a nearby region in Yunna with a view to selling 15 pigs on the market on Wednesday.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also found that the door of the nearby area was open.
In the heel, he said he saw a big scream with his mouth in the blood.
According to the news, the forensic investigation confirmed the death of a farmer with a 250-pound scream.
Guiyang Evening News reports a cousin named Wu saying that "my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised."
The surveillance camera photo shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed pigs on Thursday morning at 4.40 p.m.
His body was found about one hour later.
The man who killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
One of the market leaders told Evening News that the pig had been locked away, so that it would not harm others if the police gathered the source at the site of destination.
Yuan's family and market authorities are told about the compensation for the death penalty.
The pigs are known to have been attacked by people before, even though that is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, Massachusetts, and he suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig that was nearly 300 kg of pig was swinging against this tractor by a Welsh farmer until the wife managed to get the animal out of her way.
After the event, the farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that although the pigs are not usually aggressive, the taste of blood can act as a "slower".
"They're just games.
They're like little children, very curious, and they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to respect them properly," he said.
The residues of Hurricane Rosa bring large quantities of heavy residues to the U.S. Southwest.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to decline as it moves over the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa will, however, be bringing floods to North Mexico and to the US southwest in the next few days.
The wind speed of the rose was 38 meters per second, i.e. a 1st class hurricane, from 5 a.m. on Sunday morning at the east coast time, and it was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a low pressure coming eastwards towards the West Coast of the United States. On arrival in the California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it is beginning to push a deep tropical humidity northward towards the Southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
In the near future, the interaction of tropical moisture with the emerging low pressure will form large rain areas for lunch.
In public, rainfalls of 25 to 100 millimetres cause dangerous heavy rainfalls and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes 50-75 m2 of rainfall per hour in certain areas of the calculation, in particular in Nevada and Arizona.
For certain regions of the region at lunch, and in particular Arizona, it is expected that up to 50-100 m2 of rain can be found in some areas at lunches.
Rough floods are possible and conditions can quickly deteriorate due to the fragmentation of the tropical rain.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly recommended that we avoid leaving the wilderness for a foot.
The heavy rains can transform the canyons into flutters, and the thunderstorms create local windfalls and flying dusts.
The nearby low pressure area will bring local heavy rains to the coastal regions of South California.
The rainfalls of more than 10 mm are possible, causing small waste streams and soluble roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rain season in the area.
The spread of tropical rainfalls will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
The heavy rains spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and last all Wednesday.
In October in the United States, strong fluctuations in temperatures can be seen throughout the Arctic as the Arctic region cools down, but the tropical still remains relatively thin.
This sometimes causes high temperature swings at short distances.
In the middle of the United States there is an excellent example of high temperature differences on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha and Nebraska, St. Louis and Iowan Des Moines is almost 20 °C.
The constant heat of the circle is once again seeking to become stronger and expand in the near future.
The beginning of October is expected to be widely warm in the middle and eastern parts of the United States, at a temperature of +26 degrees from the south to the north.
In New York, the temperature can reach +26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 4 degrees warmer than the average.
According to our long-term forecast, in the east of the United States, there is good access to higher than average temperatures in the first half of October.
More than 20 million views the hearing with Brett Kavanaigh on over 20 million occasions.
On Tuesday, over 20 million saw six broadcasts broadcast by television channels, where Brett Kavanaugh, Judge of the Supreme Court, and he was charged with sexual crime in the 1980s, gave their fascinating testimony.
At the same time, the political stalemate situation continued with the fact that, at the time of the media, its transmission was interrupted, the FBI had to carry out a seven-long investigation into the accusations under the agreement concluded by Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona.
Ford told the Senate's Committee on Legal Affairs that 100 % of them were convinced that Kavanaugh was intoxicated and tried to take his clothes off in the classrooms.
Kavanaugh, in turn, gave an emotional testimony saying that 100 % of the certainty that this did not happen.
There were likely to be more viewers than the 20.4 million announced by Nielsen on Friday.
The company calculated the average of the viewers using CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
The figures for other channels that sent the opportunity, such as PBS, C-SPA and Fox Business Network, were not available at the moment.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring the viewers who look at the offices.
In terms of proportions, the reading corresponds to the number of U.S. football lottery matches or the number of Oscar-gala viewers.
According to Nielsen, the largest number of viewers among all the broadcasters was the Fox News Channel, which the opinion leaders have supported the name Kavanagh. The average number of viewers in the Czech Republic was 5,69 million throughout the day during the consultation.
ABC was the other 3,26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3,1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 89 million and CNN had 2,52 million viewers.
After the consultation, interest remained high.
Flake was at the heart of Friday's drama.
The cameras of CNN and CBS described how the protestors’ screams led him to the elevators on his way to the Committee on Legal Affairs on Friday. The backgrounds of the Maltese Republican had previously announced that he was voting for Kavanah.
CNN looked straight on the way he stood just a minute's worth of looking down at the sooths flying.
"The stand in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you believe that he will tell the people the truth?
"You have power when so many women are powerless," he was told.
Flake said that his office had issued an opinion and added, before closing the elevator arrows, that he would have more to tell the committee after consultation.
Hours later, the cable and general transmission networks sent a direct call when the Committee on Legal Affairs began to vote on the removal of the title of Kavanagh to the vote of the Assembly.
Flake, however, said that it was only in the understanding that the FBI would investigate the accusations against the candidate next week, as the Democrats in the minority have requested.
Flake was convinced to part by his friends, DR Chris Coons, on the basis of his discussions.
Flake made its decision to discuss with Coons and several other indicators.
The Flake's choice had power because it was clear that Republicans would not have sufficient votes to approve Kavanah without an investigation.
President Trump has launched a FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May blames critics for Brexit's policies.
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accuses those who criticise his EU divorce plans for policies that threaten the future of Britain and its national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at a Conservative meeting in Birmingham in Britain on 29 September 2018.
Another interview was published at the front page of May’s interview, where her former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attack on May’s so-called Chequers plan. Johnson is calling on the proposal that Britain and the EU perpetrated each other’s import duties, “I was completely absurd.”
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteo Simpson, suspected of dying a LSU player.
Police have arrested a person suspected of shooting at LSU the death of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, playing basketball.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and sent to prison, and according to Baton Rouge Police Department, he is charged with second degree murder.
The authorities published a video of the search between Sims and Simpson, where the police report that Sims lost his glasses.
The police found out about the scene and told them about Simpson's DNA, reports WAFB.
The police are telling us that Simpson has admitted Ways shooting in interrogations.
According to Advocate, the guaranteed amount was set at $30,000 according to an Advocate magazine.
A medical examiner from East Baton Rouge County published a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the neck of the neck.
The Agency thanks the State Police Task Force in Louisa, the State Police Police Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the population of the region for assisting in an investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, Director-General of LSU, thanked the law enforcement authorities for their "innovation and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-metre renegade appeared in Baton Rouge, where his father also played basketball in LSU.
He recorded an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 points for the last period of the match.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that he was "horrored" and "horrified" by the death of Waves.
"You don't always have to do something like this," Wayde said.
The leak spits over the city of Mexico.
The ash that comes out of the Popotepedl volcano has reached the southern residential areas of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, Mexico’s disaster prevention centre invited citizens to stay away from the volcano as the operations of the crater accelerated and during the day 183 gas and ash were registered during gas and ash discharges.
The central register is vibrating and shaking several times.
In the social media, images were published covering the thin layer of ash in areas such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Hiphysicists have found 72 kilometers of the city's capital to the south-west has increased the activity of the volcano since Mexico was shaken by the 7.1-magnetic earthquake in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police and the catalanists put together before the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday in Barcelona, eight persons were arrested in the gathering of protestors and riot policemen in favour of independence. Thousands participated in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the vote of divorce.
The police arrested a group of masked independenceists who threw the police with eggs and powder, which formed dark dust clouds normally on the streets filled by tourists.
In the middle of the day, there were more hakes when the police used their beans to graze the doves.
The interaction between the independence supporters and the groups of the Unions continued for several hours, while the former shouted "no forget, no forgiveness" and the latter "live Spain".
The website reports that fourteen people have been treated for minor injuries caused by demonstrations.
The tension still lies in the independence-friendly region one year after the October 1st referendum, which will be countered, but which will be celebrated by the Catalan parasites.
The voters chose independence by a clear majority, although the participation was low when the opponents voted against the difference.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in last year's violent clashes when the police tried to prevent voting in polling stations across the region.
The independence-responsive groups stayed outside on a Friday in order to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but it had to cross the other route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said that there is no longer hope for the independence of Canada.
"Last year we experienced one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for joy in voting, but now we're stuck together," he says.
The pace of last December's regional elections has fallen this year in spite of the close, but vital victory, the speed of the parties in favour of KL independence has declined. Many of the most well-known leaders are in voluntary exile or under arrest awaiting a trial of participation in the holding of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who described a police-responsive demonstration on his phone, says that there is a problem between politicians on both sides of Latvia.
"Your business is getting tense all the time," he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of the assembly who have been in custody since the last nine years, announced that they would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Being a Euro-Magic is the best way to condemn the corruption and oppression of democratic values, which we have seen by the Spanish government," he says.
Berder: A man was arrested after a car hit the house.
Men 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after the car was told that the car had happened repeatedly in Londonder.
The events took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 7:30 B.C.E., during the time of Britain.

Livingston won Rangers 1-0 at Menga goal.
Dolly Menga's first painting in Livingston confirmed victory.
The serial ascender Livingston starring Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second loss at the 18th prize as the manager of the Ibrox Society.
Dolly Mengan's paint finally won the victory over Gary Holt's team on the other side, shared with Hibernian.
Gerrard's crew missed the season's first guest victory at Premiership. Next, it will meet the next Sunday's CEO Hearts, who will be eight points above.
The Rangers will still be in the middle of the Rapid Wien European League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, continued the loss-free chain in a series of six matches. Master Coach Holt has not yet disappeared once since his replacement for Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost places to meet a visitor who was missing a blade.
The Holt's team should have led a long time before the goal of causing the Rangers serious difficulties in his sorority.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the last one went wide. Next, Alan Lithgow was able to slide in the countryside to the Craig Splitt's puss feed, but led the ball through.
The masters preferred to give the Rangers the control of the ball because they knew that they could vaccinate special situations.
That's how a significant goal came in this way.
The Rangers created a free net for Livingston from which Declan Gallagher and Robinson played for Menga, where he was able to transfer the ball to the center of the penalty zone and complete it.
The Rangers had held the ball by then, but they found that the domestic team was defending, and the goalkeeper, Liam lä, did not have much time to try.
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to fight.
The Ranger's goalie Allan McGregor prevented Scott Pittman's company and Lithgow led the ball past another special situation in Livingston.
In addition, two events were called for a unnecessary penalty kick - I cut a taded dealer, Glenn Middleton, and the hand-to-hand ball.
"Excellent performance from Livingston - analysis
BBC in Scotland with Alasdair Lamont Tony Macaoni arena
Great performance and performance from Livingston.
The team continued to overrun expectations and was excellent for each player, continuing through the management.
The team’s way of playing and the crew has hardly changed since it got back to the highest set.However, it is necessary to acknowledge the way in which it has strengthened the team once it has arrived.
He had a lot of lies.
Häkett was a great leader in his excellent organization of defence, with Menga holding Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes the whole round.
Although Rangers did not have any ideas, there was no idea.
The team has performed very well at times under Gerrard, but it is now far from his standards.
The final feed was exhausted and they managed to open up the defense of the home team only once. This should be an alarm to the Rangers, which is the middle of the series.
Erdogan received a receipt at Cologne.
The smile was delicate and the sky was blue on Saturday (29 September), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin in the morning.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is intended to improve relations with NATO allies.
Disputes have been both about human rights and press freedom and about Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued his journey to Cologne to open up a new new new brand-new mosque.
The largest Turkish population in the city lives outside of Turkey.
Policeed 25 000 members of the group of supporters from the Moscheya, on the basis of safety reasons, but there were still many supporters nearby to watch the President.
The protesters against the hundreds of Erdogan, many of whom were the Kurds, also brought their voices to voice, condemning both Erdogan's politics and the decision of the German Government to invite him to the country.
Competitive protests reflect the distribution of views, some of Germany’s Turkish greets him as a hero while others mock him for self-righteousness.

There are roadblocks in place and bus and bus traffic has been diverted elsewhere, and drivers have been invited to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards were injured in restlessness.
The prison officials report six prisoners in the state of the war in the prison of high-security security for injured men.
The gaps began in HMP Long Lartin prison in Workestershire around 09:30 p.m. on Sunday, UK time and will continue.
Police officers from Tornado have been brought in to calm down the restlessnesss behind which eight prisoners are in one prison together.
The police's minor facial injury was treated at the site of the incident.

There are over 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
The warden was told that he had received hospital treatment in June after one of the prisoners had attacked him.
In October, the police were called to the prison because of serious restlessness, which attacked the staff with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa brings the threat of severe floods to the calm, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (sauersal areas may benefit)
In Arizona, rare tropical pressures occur, but that is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week, when the residues of Hurricane Rosa are transferred over lunch weeks, bringing with them the risk of heavy floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning on the heavy floods during Mondays and Tuesdays from West Arizona to South and East of Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, as well as the cities of Fehine, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly across Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rains.
The Phoenix National Weather Service stated in its TWI that only "10 European storms have survived a tropical storm or a low pressure state at 300 km distance from the city since 1950".
Katrina (1967) was still a restaurant at a distance of 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest versions of the National Centre predict 50-100 millimetres of rains. Its mogollin practice in Arizona can be up to 150 millimetres.
In other lunch-week areas, including the central river mountains and Great Basin, 25-50 millilitres are likely to be available. In some places, a total of up to 100 millimetres can be reached.
The pink rains can also be a blessing to be tested in a dry area if there is no risk of heavy rainfalls.
Although the floods pose a serious threat, some of the crops can also be useful because of the severe drought in the south-west lunch.
According to the United States, more than 40% of Arizona suffers from at least the extreme drought, which is second highest, says weather.com.
My Hurricane Rosa is on her way first to landing in the California peninsula in Mexico.
Sunday morning, Rosa's location is 620 km south of the Punta Eugenia in Mexico. At that time, it is still a hurricane's strong wind speed of 135 km/h. It moves north at 20 km/h.
The storm will take effect when it comes to colder waters in the Pacific Sea.
Consequently, it is expected to arrive at the strength of Mexico’s tropical storm during Monday afternoon or evening.
In part of Mexico, rains can be severe and cause a significant flood risk.
"From the heart of Kalifornia to the north-west Sonora is expected to be 75-150 millimetres, and up to 250 millimetres is possible," says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue her journey through Mexico as a tropical storm before it arrives at the Arizona border as a tropical parasitic pressure on Tuesday mornings, from which it will continue to travel through Arizona to the south of Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest risks of pink or its residues are associated with very heavy rainfalls in the California peninsula, North-West Europe and in the US Southwest desert," says the National Hurricane Agency.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old men were arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday morning in the UK time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in a "stable" state.
The police report that they have arrested one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old in Radstock area in Avon and Somerset during the night.
The police are asking for a contact with anyone who may have video footage of events recorded on the mobile phone.
Trump says the "evil and anger" of the democratic party that was experienced by Kavanaughi.
"The voice in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the fearless and shameful methods of the democratic party," Trump said at the meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump said that the democratic party that suffered Kavanagh's "evil and anger" throughout its term process of appointment.
Kavanaugh witnessed before the Congress on Thursday, He strongly and emotionally denied the charge of sexual harassment brought by Mr. Blasy Ford, which would have happened decades ago during their teen years.
Ford also proved himself in the hearing of his accusations.
The President said on Saturday "The Americans saw Kavanaugh's excellentness, nature and courage" that day.
"The vote in favour of confirming the title of Judge Kavanagh is one of the most earned legal doctrines of our time, with excellent seaweeds for the public service," he told his group of West Virginia's supporters.
The President referred indirectly to the name of Kavanagh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican vote in the interim elections.
"We are five weeks away from the main elections during our lifetime.
I wasn't just campaigning, I was campaigning all over," he said.
"Therefore, I will fight everywhere to fight for excellent candidates."
The Trump claimed that the Democrat took over the task of "responsibility and prevention".
An assistant member of the Republican Parliamentary Assembly of the Republican Party informed the CNN that the first important vote on the Kavanagh appointment procedure is expected to take place at the Senate no later than Friday.
In the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis, hundreds of dead people are expected to die, the number of victims of death is expected to rise.
On Saturday, the authorities reported a major earthquake and tsunami that died at least 384 dead on the island of Sulawes in Indonesia. Many of them were wiped off by the giant waves that hit the beaches.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at the festival on the beach of the city, while waves up to six feet high struck the beach in the evening. Many were washed to death by the destruction of the waves from all over the road.
Csunmin caused by the powerful earthquakes of 7.5 Magnified Magnitude.
When the threat of the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still at the beach and did not immediately escape when they fell victim to it," says an informant from BNPB at the International Agency for Great Accident Reduction in Indonesia, Muwo Nugrho Jakarta.
"The sauna didn't come alone, but it carried cars, wooden trunks, houses, and hit all the country," says Nugroho. He adds that the tsunami reached 800 kilometers on the open sea before hitting the coast.
Some of the people survived the tsunami by climbing trees alive, he says.
Some 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Atmospheric images published by the Disaster Agency show a number of destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and water-baked mosques.
The follow-up attacks were still shaking the city of the city on Saturday.
Earthquakes seemed to be in the area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency BPPT issued an opinion that the energy released on Friday was about 200 atomic bombs dropped to Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the landscape of a long and narrow city at the end of the bay could cause the tsunamis to shine.
Nugroho described the engulf as "wide" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had fallen down.
He told us that the bodies of some victims were found in the ruins of broken buildings and added that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the victims of death and that the damage may be larger from a request 300 km north of a coast, called Donggala, in an area that is closer to the center of the earthquake.
Communication links "are completely broken, and no information has been received about Donggala", says Nugroho.
According to the statement by the Red Cross, there are more than 300 000 people living there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse," he said.
The Agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not telling the tsunami hit Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had arrived during the warning.
A man on the upper decks of a building in a social media playful video shouts at warnings of approaching tsunamis to people on the street.
Only minutes later, a water wall hits the beach, which takes buildings and cars.
Reuters did not have a chance to prove the authenticity of the image material.
The earthquake and the tsunami caused a massive power failure that cut off the communications around us, which made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate their rescue operations.
The authorities tell us that the army has begun to send help from Jakarta and other cities by means of transport machines, but you still urgently need food and other basic goods to be evacuated.
The airport of the city has been reopened only for help purposes and will remain closed until October.
President Either Widodon was due to visit the evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's a really bad situation.
The staff of the World Vision Dongala have come to a safe place in the City, where they have been housed in the interior of the office on the roofs of tents, and on the way they have passed the scene of destruction, says Doseba.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he says.
It's a really bad situation.
When the relief teams started their comforting task, some complained that foreign humanitarian workers would be prevented from going to Palu.
According to the Indonesian provisions, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start to flow once the area of emergency has been declared a national emergency area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"There is, of course, a regional disaster," says Aulia Ariani, the informant of the red cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can start receiving international help, but the declaration has not yet been made.
When the second night landed Please on top of the Friday earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members who were lost gave rise to the hope that their close proximity to trade would be different from the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday night, a small boy was raised from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been in ruins for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, an independent team coach in Indonesia, had trained two missing addicts for Asian races earlier this month.
The Roa Roa Hotel was trapped as well as his students, says Mandagi.
"As a senior member of the council, I have my own emotional burden," he says.
Gendon tells us that he has deliberately sought to reach out to the participants in the beach festival Please contestants with WhatsApp messages after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread among the interrelationshipal community.
However, after the messages he sent me, only one grey sign appeared instead of two green characters.
"I think that means that no messages were sent," he says.

Kanye West: Räpker changed his name Ye
Räpök Kanye West changes its name to Ye.
When he announced the review on Saturday, he wrote: "The character who was first known as Kanye West.
Ye has been the name of a 41-year-old West nickname for some time, and he also used it as the name of his fifth album, published in June.
A change in his future appearance in the Saturn Night Live programme where he is expected to be released a new album called Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the author of the program, canceled his participation in the program for "scientific reasons".
West has previously told us that the word also has a religious significance for him, in addition to being shortened from his professional name.
Speaking about the name of the album last year with the big boy, the radio driver, West, said, "You believe that "ye" is the most common word in the Bible, and there it means "you."
"So I'm you, us, and all of us.
It began with Kanya, which means nothing, and ended up in a shorter form Ye - which merely reflects the goodness, evil, confusion, everything in us.
The Album is just trying to figure out who we are.
He is one of several known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known for being known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his favorite names Love and Brother Love.
Also, former West's partner, JAY-Z, has, between now and then, removed and returned the guidelines and the big letters.
AMLO promise not to use the army against civilians.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was elected President of Mexico, promised never to use military force against civilians. The announcement arrived on the 50th anniversary of the retaliation of students.
Lopez Obrador, who was on Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza University, promised that "no army would be used by the Mexican people for repression at all.
The armed forces fired a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people during a time when left-wing migrations were taking place in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly study support and opening up free public universities.
He said that the lack of unemployment and access to education and training was driving young people to crime.
The Communities should double the financing of AI.
The United States should double its funding for the investigation of AI while China enhances its activity in this field, which is what I say about the sponsor and the professional Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, and Kai-Fu Lee.
Opinions were preceded by the services relating to the AI of various parts of the US administration, even if the United States lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China has already presented its plans last year: it is seeking to become an artificial intelligence developer by 2030.
"The duplication of the AI budget would be a good start when you note that other countries are so far behind the United States, and that we are looking for another breakthrough of AI", says Lee.
Doubled funding could double the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence supply would be made in the United States, Lee reported on this week's CNBC interview this week.
Leen's book The Great Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month through the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who works as CEO at the Synovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's major artificial intelligence companies called Face++.
In the 1980s he developed an AI system at the Carnegie Mellon University, which defeated the United States' highest-ranked Ottello player, and later he worked as the head of Microsoft Research and the head of Google's activities.
Recognize the former US government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects and Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next steps would be taken to identify future visions.
Lee tells U.S. researchers that he's working hard to get public help.
"The academic influences are not taken away by China but by large companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been recruiting university tops in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
I also said that changes in the policy of immigration could help the United States to enhance their artificial intelligence efforts.
"I think those who have completed an AI doctoral degree should be automatically issued green cards," he said.
The sub- Government of the United States of America's next AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation grants funding to persons working in academic institutions in the same way as the National Science Foundation and other state organisations grant money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is less than that of the academic work, Lee said.
This year, the Ministry of Defence set up the Defense Department Joint Industrial Intelligence Center, which is intended to bring together partners in the industrial and academic world, and the White House has also announced the setting up of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
DARPA was also announced this month for a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
NSF in turn invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
The legislative initiative aimed at setting up a national safety committee for artificial intelligence has not gone forward in months.
The citizens of the country in a referendum on the amendment of the name of the country will be put to the vote.
In the Sunday’s referendum, the Macedonians voted to change the name of the country to “the Republic of Northern Macedonia”. This change would resolve the dispute with Greece, which has prevented the country’s efforts to become a member of the European Union and NATO.
According to Greece, which has a rural region, the name of the neighbour is in fact a regional requirement for its territory and has therefore opposed its entry into the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the countries signed an agreement on a new draft title, but, in the opinion of the dissented opponents, the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Russian majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the vote, and the campaign against the vote raises doubts as to whether voting will reach the required threshold of 50 % so that the result will be legal.
The question put to the vote was: "You are on the side of NATO and EU membership accepting the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the roll-over like Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that it is worth paying the price in order to allow Macedonia, which has risen from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to seek both EU and NATO membership. .
"I came today to vote in favour of the future of our country in Macedonia for young people so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it is a safer life for all of us," said the 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska Skopje, 79-year-old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they respect the outcome of the vote so that it would have a decisive effect.
The change of name requires two-thirds of the vote in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported by 13.00.
However, the turnout was only 16, compared to 34% of the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the voting rights were put to a vote.
"I came to vote for my children and to place us in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, who voted for the capital in Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumica in Macedonia on 30 September 2018. The change of name would open the way for NATO and EU membership.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of the tents set up by boycotts on behalf of the Skopje Parliament.
"We carry NATO and the EU, but we want to join heads up, not through the kitchen door," said Kädarkov.
"We are poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can come back, like China and Russia, as part of the integration of the euro issue.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring the required investments to Macedonia, with an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe in the majority in favour of a voting roll-call because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said "yes" to the voice "a means of harm" to our future.
The opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday referred to a vote of 30-43% in the referendum, i.e. less than the required activity.
57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday in the second half of the second round of Macedonia's Telma TV.
Seventy per cent of them voted in favour of the yes option.
For the referendum to succeed, voting must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback to the aggressive government in May last year.
Look: The city's Sergio Agero was defeated by the whole Brighton defence.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were looking for evidence of Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City 2-0 victory.
Aguero made his goal at 65 minutes look ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the birth, the Argentinian lead player received input from the middle field.
He found an empty space in the field by attacking three Brighton defensemen through an empty field.
Then Agero noticed that he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He stabbed one of the defenders and then left several others after him on the edge of the Brighton Penalty Zone.
Then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English tip used its first contact inside the penalty zone to give the ball back to Aguero, who passed by a shot to the right corner of Mathew Ryan's goal by the Brighton watchman.
Pep Guardiolo, the City manager, told journalists that "Aguero has a problem with his feet.
"We talked about him playing for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's the way it is.
Lucky for us that he scored in that time period.
Sterling, however, had already given the heavenlys an advantage in the election of the election.
The painting came in on the night of the game.
Aguero got a ball in a situation deep in the Brighton area.
He gave Leroy Sane a beautiful power supply on the left side of his left hand.
Sane took a few contacts before he sent the ball to the back of the ball towards Sterling.
The celestial assailant stuck the ball in the net just before the end of the line.
City meets Hoffenheim Masters in the League on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be a happy pilot in the fight against the Rockies.
The Worlds is out of a slot game, so why did I push for a start-up meeting?
However, Scherzer always hopes that he will take over the punch at Sunday's match against the Colorado Kings, but only if he still has a slot game game. They will have one victory in the western series of Los Angeles Dodgers.
Rockies caught at least a wild card with their 5-win card from the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still aiming for their first divisional goal.
"Even though we do not have a contribution, at least we can rise to the input bar knowing that the public and the other team's hurling atmosphere here in Denver will create me the most demanding competition regime I have ever faced this year.
Why would I not want to challenge you?"
They have not yet published their founders on Sunday, but according to the information, they are inclined to give Scherzer the opportunity under these circumstances.
Scherzer threw a training session on Thursday, playing 34 at the start of his match and eating on Sunday at normal rest.
The Washington right-hand player has an 18-7 profit/loss ratio this season. The ERA statistics are 2.53 and has burned the hiter 300 times, with a alternate of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the situation of his Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanagh, who also spoke about the importance of the vote of the Republicans in the mid-term elections.
"All our achievements will be in play in November.
We are five weeks away from the main elections during our lifetime.
This is one of the great -- not just campaigning, but campaigning full-time, and that's why I'm all over the world fighting for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You will see this terrible, terrible, radical group of Democrats, you will see it happening right now.
They've decided to return to you by whatever means necessary, and you can see their defamation and defamation.
They do not choose who is being harmed or who needs to be hurled so that they can enter into power; that is what they want, power and power, but we do not give it to them.
He said that the Democrat took over the task of "responsibility and prevention".
"And it has been seen in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the angry and the wicked and the evil and the lying."
In his name, he refers to the most important communicator in the Committee on Legal Affairs in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein, and the general public, with loud cheers.
"Do you remember his answer?
Are you sure you want to write the document?
Uh, uh, what?
Well, no, I'm waiting a little - it was a really bad body language - the bad body language I've seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant church.
It does not tolerate those who speak their opinion.
I'm not really surprised when my local party's Momentum activists supported the motion of censure against me.
At least I'm only the last member of the last line of Labour, who's told I'm not welcome just because we say what we think.
Joan Ryan, my fellow Member of Parliament, was treated in the same way just because he was strongly opposed to anti-diseases.
In my case, the motion of censure in my case was critical of my disagreement with Corbyn.
Topics relating to responsible economic policies, national security, Europe, irony similar to those of previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: "We want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
The majority of the eight years I have served as a local representative of the Labour, that's exactly what the political council's agendas have been.
Many of the meetings now fail to comply with that tone, and the "friendly and gentler" policy has long since been forgotten if it ever began.
It is increasingly clear that different opinions are no longer tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether or not it is appropriate for the party management.
This began shortly after the birth of Jeremy as a leader. The colleagues with whom I had thought I would share a similar political view began to expect me from a complete translation and comments that I would otherwise never have agreed to, be it national security or the internal market in the EU.
Every time I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is the belt of insults in the social media, which requires the withdrawal of my choice, the rejection of a central policy and I hear that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
This is not just my own experience.
I really know I'm happier than some of my colleagues, because the comments that I've been targeted at are, at the very least, dubious in nature.
I greatly respect the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face daily sex and racist insults and never fade.
The normalisation of treatment is one of the most disturbing features of the policy of this period.
Last week, Mr. Corby insisted that the Labour Party should create a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a Party that accepts different opinions, and with each motion of censure or change of selection, the party becomes only a more limited party.
For two years, I have been urged to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that "all things are going well."
But that's not why I went to politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the misdemeanours of the Itcher Government in the comprehensive school, I have been both the City Council and the Minister's office seeking better public services for those who need them most.
I've never covered up my political policy, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been surprised by my views or differences with current leadership.
For those who supported the initiative last Friday, I would like to say that when the state is moving towards a Brexite that is damaging to households, businesses and public services, I do not understand why it is necessary to waste time and energy to challenge my trust in the Labour Party leadership.
But my true message is not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents: I represent you with honour, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of political careers does not prevent me from acting in a way that I think is in your interest.

Ayr - Melrose 38-17: The Invulnerable Ayr complex.
The last two seconds of paint slightly distorted the outcome of the match, but Ayr undoubtedly earned a win at a day’s entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team out of 10, which has not lost any match.
After all, an excellent defence and a more successful risk-taking was what supported them, and coach Peter Murchie may well be pleased.
"We've been challenged at our matches and we're still undefeated, so I can be happy." he says.
Melrosen Roby Christie says, "All credit to Ayri, they took risks better than we did."
Ayr took the lead at 14 minutes on Grant Anderson's goal and Frazier Climo's successful conversion kick, but the yellow card of the Scottish captain Roy Hughes, Captain of the Warriers match, enabled Melrose to rise, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo raised Ayri's leadership in the punishment field, and just before halftime he scored and succeeded in the conversion shot, increasing Ayri's leadership by 17-5.
But Melrose started the second round well at Patrick Anderson's goal, which in the conversion shot, Baggot managed to narrow the difference to five points.
It was a long delay when Ruardh Knott was seriously injured and carried out out of the field. As the game continued, Ayr raised his lead on the goal of Staffford McDowall, which was successful in the conversion shot by Climo.
Ayri Captain Macpherson received a yellow card after which Melrose Bruce Colvine made a paint that was not successful in the conversion.
The home team, however, answered when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from the ballless Climo tadding, and Macpherson scored the Ayr maul's foot from the side cut.
Climo succeeded in the conversion shot in the same way as before, and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The star of the Still Game series begins with the restaurant industry.
The Star of Still Game Ford Kieran has been appointed director of the licensed company and is expected to start working in the restaurant industry as well.
The 56-year-old actor presents Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program, which he will script with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the next nine years will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the public records, he has been appointed head of Adriftmor's Limited company.
The actor himself refused to comment on the information, but the source of Scottish Sun suggested that Kiern wanted to join the flourishing restaurant business of Glasgow.
"The sea belongs to us": the nation of Bolivia is trying to get back in touch with the Pacific Ocean by legal means.
Sailors identified the seamen outside the Fleet in La Paz.
In the flag of public buildings there is a blue flag flaming.
Support for the fleet Titicacalta Amazon has been inspired by a slogan: "The sea is right for us to be part of the sea.
It is our duty to recover it."
Inward Bolivia's memory of the lost coastline to Chile in the bloody 18th century resource war is still strong – as well as the longing to sail in the Pacific once again.
Hope is at its highest for decades, while Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has strong progress, shared spirit and inseparability, and, of course, a positive attitude in waiting for a final decision," said the British diplomat Roberto Calzad.
Several people from all over the country are next looking forward to the decision of the International Court of Justice on the big screens, hoping that the Hague will support – after decades of misguided debate – the position of Bolivia that it is the duty of Chile to grant independent access to the sea in Bolivia.
The charismatic President of Bolivia, Evo Morales, who will face the re-election of the contested war next year, will have a lot to play next Monday in line.
"The return to the Pacific Ocean is very close," he convinced at the end of August.
Indeed, some of the investigators believe that the court is not likely to decide in the interest of Bolivia, and even if it were to decide, the situation would not change much.
In addition, ICJ has announced that it will not determine the future of any possible negotiations.
The fact that ICJ's decision is only given six months after the last comments have been made suggests that the case "is not complex", says Paz Zárate, an expert on international law in Chile.
In addition, the last two years have been more slow than the intention of Bolivia.
"The current Bolivian regime has seized the question of maritime connections," said Zárate.
Morales' quarreling rhetoric has stifled the rest of the Chilean welfare, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their discussions at some point, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations after this.
In both countries, there has been no other embassy since 1962.
The former President and the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the decision of the Court would have been exceptionally rapid.
Monday gives Bolivia the "extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end the 19th-year-long differences on both sides", she said.
Calzad also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, should have used the method of shipping as a political support.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to be connected to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move forward from the past."
North Korea stated that nuclear diversity would not occur unless it could trust the United States of America.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can trust Washington, said North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He reminded the US of the commitments made by the Heads of State at the Summit in Singapore.
Rin's position came just before the US Minister of Foreign Affairs Mike Pompeo re-launched the deadlock of the diplomat on nuclear weapons, only three months after the United States met Kim Jong Uni in Singapore.
Ric said that there is a "long-range dream" to believe that the continued sanctions and the opposition of the United States to the Korean declaration of the end of the war would bring North Korea to its knees.
Before Pjongjang has taken important measures to prevent the use of weapons, Washington is on guard when adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump of the United States will be holding a new summit.
However, the view that Pjongjang would be intending to abandon the military service, which the State is likely to see as the only real means of guaranteeing its own security, has received widespread suspicions about its own security.
Pompeo is about to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump Summit.
The Paris Paris fashion polls demonstrate the large capitals of the latest collection, which will soon also be in your near future.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun as a whole, you do not need to continue looking for it.
The designers Valentino and Thom Businesse revealed in their SS19 edition the selection of special super-great headgear that would dazzle Paris' fashion week styles.
Very impractical headgear took over this summer, and these designers have also sent out their amazing creations for fashion performances.
The most striking creation in the landscape was the beige hat with a wide feather sleeve, which covered almost all the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included, among other things, the watermelon, the sorcerer hat and even the pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head open.
Thom Browne also revealed a range of distinctive masks – just before Halloween.
Several colored masks had sewn lips, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than peak fashion.
One creation with snorkel and mask was more like a diving device, and the other resembled a melt of ice cream.
And if you want to take a stand for a big fashion, you're lucky.
The followers of fashion predict that the huge scales are appearing in the picture.
The oversized hats follow strictly "La Bomba", a half-metre long-sleeved straw hat seen from all Rihanta to Emily Ratajkowski.
In social media, the cultor of an impractical hat was also attached to the fashion proposals of another sized creation – a front-end beach bag, which is nearly as large as the model it wears.
With a burned orange kaisla decorate lined raffilk on white leather hand straps was the most striking creation of Jacquemus' La Riviera's SS19 edition in Paris's fashion days.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told the FEMAIL: "I am looking at big-sized hats and beach bags on the street next summer – designers have made such an impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized dwellings."
John Edward: Language skills are the only skill for the nation’s people.
The results of the private schools in Scotland have been historically good, and this success has also continued in 2018 as a result of good test results. Success has been enhanced by individual and community success in sport, art, music and other community projects.
These schools of more than 30 000 students in various parts of Scotland, represented by the Scottish Board of Private Schools SSIS, aim to provide a high level of service to their students and to their parents.
Vocational schools are seeking to prepare their students for their careers, further education and higher education and for the people of the world.
A training operator who can design and implement tailor-made study content has noticed the position of languages as a popular and desirable teaching experience in educational institutions.
Â Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message will go to his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relations with people from other countries.
From the latest test results this year, we find that languages are at the top of the range for the percentage of accessibility between primary schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages reached the highest grade A.
Based on the data, it was found that students who received the best grade A, 72% studied Mandarin Chinese, 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that the Scottish private schools will support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill, which children and young people will no longer have in the future.
They are currently free-choice subjects, but they are considered to be of the same value as scientific subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), both in the private school study programme and elsewhere.
On the basis of the survey carried out by the UK Employment Office in 2014, it was found that 17% of situations where the employer had difficulty finding an appropriate employee were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore even more necessary for promoting career development in young people's future.
The more potential jobs require language skills, the more essential these skills are made up in the world.
If a person has studied another language, he will have the advantage in the future of this lifelong skill, regardless of which career he has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner will automatically put a language-qualified person above competition.
According to a survey carried out by YouGov in 2013, 75 % of over 4 000 individuals in Britain are unable to speak in a foreign language, and French was the only language that could be used for a two-digit figure of 15%.
For this reason, it is important to invest in teaching languages now for the children of the present day.
In particular, knowledge of the languages of developing countries gives children a better chance to find a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ from each other as to what languages they teach.
Several schools focus on traditional languages, while some specifically teach languages that are supposed to be important to the people of the United Kingdom in 2020, such as Mandarins and Japanese.
Despite your child’s interest in private schools, there are always several language options taught by specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed for success, whatever the future will bring.
In this period, it cannot be denied that languages in the international business environment will continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this should reflect training.
Indeed, the current languages should be viewed as "international communication skills".
Vocational schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and high-level education for young people in Scotland.
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
John Edward is the head of SCIS, the Board of the Scottish Private Schools Board, of the SCIS.
LeBron makes debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The first appearance of LeBron James in Los Angeles Lakers will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will be playing against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego before the beginning of the season.
But the number of minutes he really plays will remain to be seen.
"It will be more than one, and less than 48" said at the official website of the Walton Lakers.
Lakers supplier Mike Truell Twitch explained that James is likely to play orphan pieces.
Following the exercises, many were asked earlier this week about his plans for the six matches to be played before the Lakers.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare", he said.
The time of the Eastern Virginia campaign, YouTube Canal, is the time of the most popular Western-Virginian campaign.
President Donald Trump will start a series of election campaigns today in the Whispering West Virginia.
It will be the first of the five events planned for next week's event, including consensual targets such as Tenne and Mississippi.
While awaiting the vote, in order to fill his choice of Supreme Court Judge, Trump will endeavour to increase support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republics are in danger of losing the majority in the elections in November.
At what time is the campaign for West Virginia today and how do you see it online?
The event of the reformed West-Virginian Wheeling starts at 19 o'clock on Saturday, 29.9.2018.
You can view Trump's Western Virginia campaign online as a Liv esterification via YouTube by clicking below.
Trump should refer to the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Judge-Rapporteur of the Supreme Court this week, who became accused of intense sexual harassment, who have delayed the vote of confirmation at the end of the week of the FBI's investigation.
But the primary objective of a series of campaigns is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the tight elections in November.
Thus, comments on President Trump's campaign were made on the purpose of these five events next week's "to wake voluntary and profitable Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and in the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"The control of the region is so important for him that the president is prepared to go to as many states as possible during the urgent campaign", told Reuters, an anonymous representative of the Trumpic campaign, who remained anonymous.
Today's event is in Wesbanco Airport Wheeling, and you can even arrive at "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media representatives from Pittsburgh" according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second visit to the Trump in West Virginia, the state in which he won more than 40 units in 2016.
Trump supports the senatorial candidate Patrick Morrisey of the Republics in West Virginia, who has remained behind in the opinions.
"From the point of view of Mr Murry, it is not a good indication that the President is trying to raise his support in opinion polls," said scribe Simon Haeder of the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team will demonstrate the will to fight in order to survive before Sunday's exclusive games.
After the three-sided session, Saturday afternoon’s four-games were exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
Although the self-enhancing power of success is a fully invented phenomenon in sport, players believe it, and more so in this kind of tournament.
Where does this power of success seem to them to be at the moment?
"They had a six-point lead that narrowed down to four, so we take this as a success force," said Jordan Spieth walking away at the end of the day.
Europe has, of course, priority: four points above and 12 playable.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel that they have a little wind on their sails and much to be encouraged about, like the rightness of Spieth and Justin Thomas, which enabled them to play all day together and scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been an overwhelming title to the green, leading by example.
The voice of victory on the throats of the festival grew stronger as he succeeded in a critical set to a level equal to four when he and Thomas were two points behind two holes.
A round where they won the 15th round was followed by a similar auction that gave the impression that he believes that the US team has not lost yet.
"You need to focus really well and take care of your own price," Spieth said.
That's the only thing players have left.
18 holes to make an effect.
The only players who have scored more points than Pieth and Thomas in the last two days are Ryder Cup's undisputed legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The European special, but the sweet twin has won four out of four without error.
"Moliwood" was the only two who did not make any bugs on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bugs on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
The round, and the way they give and receive energy from this horrid public, confirms that they are the pre-requisites of Sunday. And when the sun falls down at Le Golf National, the second most popular player to secure Europe’s potential for victory could not be than Fleetwood and Molinari.
I'd rather do both at the same time on different thighs.
The speeches on Europe's success are indeed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated a partnered Sergio Garcia with Alex Noren, who was a quarter game hero this morning.
One bogi and two double bogs on the first nine holes took the Spanish and Swedish so deep in the hole that they were nowhere near to survive there.
On Sunday, no one's coming to get you out of the hole.
Four ball and four game are fascinating to follow from a couple’s point of view: What kind of advice do they give or leave behind, and how the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a prominent lead before the last day, but this game showed that the United States team is willing to fight, although it has been suspected in the United States in particular.
Europe will take the 10-6 leadership before Ryder Cup’s last day.
Europe is at a good time before the last day of Ryder Cup, after they took the Saturday in the football and the four-games, 10-6 leading positions from the United States of America.
The great twins, Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, led the profit in two victory over the blatant Tiger Woods, and won a score of four points today in Le Golf.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who worked hard to maintain his defeat two years ago in Hazeltien, dominated the weakly played United States team in the morning’s four-ball, leading the match to a point of point 3-1.
The United States were both opponents in four games, winning two matches, but they could not narrow the lead.
Jim Fury's half needed eight points of Sunday's 12 double games to preserve victory.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner who has won four points in a row. He and Molinari, also called Molliwood, were the second two in the history of Ryder Cup after a sensational weekend, who has won four points in the first four games.
First crushed by Woods and Patrick Reed, they then supersede Woods and the U.S. initiativer Brussels Dechambeau 5-4 even more forcefully.
Woods, who barely survived through the two fights of Saturday, was occasionally very great, but has still lost 19 of his 29 matches in a four-legged and four-game game, and up to seven in a row.
Justin rose the morning’s four-balls, but returned to the game with Henrik Stenson, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third.
Europe did not get everything on this fresh and happy day from Paris to lunch.
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high target for the United States at two points on Saturday.
They will win a blatant 2-1 victory over Spain's Jo Rahm and Ian Poulter in a square, and later on, 4.3 victory over Poulter and Rory McIllroy in a four-game after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup, the team has risen from the four-point pursuit position to the levels at the start of the double game, even if the Furyk side is also a match enough to keep the win.
True, after two days in second, the best could be that too much has been asked to counter the Sunday attack.
North korea "not in any way" takes off its own weapons without confidence.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the UN on Saturday that constant sanctions only increased mistrust in the United States, and in these circumstances there is no chance that North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Mr. Yong Ho said at the UN General Assembly that during the last year, North Korea has taken "a significant measure of good faith" such as the completion of nuclear and missile tests, decommissioned a nuclear test and promised that North Korea would not increase the amount of nuclear weapons or technology.
"However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of maintaining national security, so in such circumstances, the fact that we are being removed from arms unilaterally is not possible."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known appeal power that the Washington does not accept a phased nuclear surrender that would reward North Korea for every interim theme, his statement is significant in the sense that unilateral arms are not completely deported, as Pjongjang has done in the past.
He referred to the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States and the President of North Korea at the June 12th 12th of June, and said that Kim promised to guarantee the safety of North Korea.
North Korea has been trying to reach a formal conclusion between 1950 and 1953 in the Korean War, but the United States has called for Pjongjang to first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the facilitation of strict international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. demands "nuclear extermination first", and has put pressure on sanctions to achieve their goal of violence – even against "the declaration of peace", said Ri.
"The fact that sanctions would bring us to our knees is the hope of the uninterrupted.
However, the problem is that constant sanctions only deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans to hold the next Kim-Trump Summit, which, however, was highlighted by Ómp himself to the UN earlier this week.
On the other hand, the minister stressed three meetings with the Director of South Korea's Moon Jae-in in the last six months and added: "If the party requiring arms was South Korea and not the United States, the situation would not have progressed to such an impasse."
Then the tone of the Ring was considerably different last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that the direction of missiles towards the United States continents was inevitable after the "bad President" Trump called Kim a "missile" equipped with suicide intentions.
Last year Trump threatened to "destruct completely" the North Korean. However, this year Trump congratulated Kimi on this courage to approach the ceasefire, but stressed that there is still a great deal of work to be done and sanctions to remain until the North is abandoned from nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump mentioned that he had no time-out period: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia were concerned that the UN Security Council should reward the Pjongjang for the progress already made.
However, U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The strengthening of sanctions by the Security Council must go on strong and without prejudice to as long as we find a complete, final and confirmed abandonment of nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously enhanced sanctions against North Korea since 2006, with a view to disrupting the financial channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear missiles in Pjongjang.
Pompeo met with the North Korean Rin at the UN General Assembly, and he also announced that he would visit Pjongjang again next month for preparations for the second summit.
Pompeo has been to North Korea three times already this year, but the last visit did not go unmistakably.
On his departure from Pyongyang, he described the progress made. However, North Korea condemned Pompeo’s “gangsterical requirements” only a few hours later.
During the meeting with Secretary-General Moon, North Korea committed itself to closing the missile base and the nuclear facility earlier this month in case the United States "takes equivalent measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "with similar measures" the security guarantees that Trump committed to at the meeting in Singapore, and the transition towards normality with Washington.
Harvard students shall complete an adequate course of rest guidance for students.
All undergraduate students from Harvard University will take part this year in a course aimed at increasing student rest. The course is counter-reversible to a macho culture that flourishs at the University, where students weigh a long night with caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the world's best university are often very ignorant of basic issues related to their own well-being.
The course is designed by Professor Charles Czeisler, professor of the Harvard University Medical Faculty, who works in a sleep study at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that the course is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler received an idea for the course after lectured on the impact of sleep deficit on learning.
"After my education, a young woman came to me who said, "Don't you hear me about this right now, my last year of study?"
No one had ever told him about the need for a dream, which I thought was surprising," he told him at the Telegraph interview.
The course organised for the first time this year will guide students on how the right ideals support academic and sporting performances and improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of the University of Harvard Medical University and Vice-President of the University Health Services, says that the university has completed its course after they had heard how students were suffering from serious sleep problems during the study week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
A part of the students will be given a picture of the apartment room where the student can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books, thereby obtaining information on the effects of caffeine and light, and on the impact of sleep shortages on sports performances and the importance of regular evening activities.
In the second part, participants are told how long-term sleep deficits can raise the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campaign map with interactive icons encourages participants to consider their daily routines.
"We know that this does not have an immediate effect on student behavior.
However, we believe that they have the right to know about these matters just as they have the right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler adds more.
According to Professor Czeisler, all-night study rotors are still a subject of pride, and modern technology and the ever-growing pressures of students caused the growing problem of sleep deficits.
The Professor points out that "to have a good and high level of sleep should be the stress, fatigue and anxiety of the students, and even the increased weight, because sleep shortages cause a state of hunger in the brain, making man constantly hungry".
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical psychology in California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he attended one of his teaching courses during his first year in Harvard last year.
He reports the course opened his eyes and gave a boost to the organisation of a comprehensive course for all campus students.
He hopes that all post-graduate students will be able to complete a similar study set before the transition to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends giving students a wake-up call to remind them not only of the bedtime, but also of the morning wake-up, and urges them to keep in mind the adverse reactions caused by electronic display devices and LED lighting to daily rhythms, which may make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's shot won off Gerrard's players.
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers had another loss day when Dolly Menga's shot, through a broken defense, gave Livingston 1-0 victory.
Ibrox players were winning their first win then on February 4th, which was run against St. Johnstone. Gary Holt's team, however, won this time, and Gerrard now won his second defeat during his 18-game manager career. Rangers missed a eight-point election from the current leader, Hearts.
Menga put the ball to the finish seven minutes before the halftime, and the situation has not been corrected since then by the fact that the Rangers have fallen into battle.
The Rangers fell to the sixth place as a result of the game. On the other hand, Livingston has climbed to the third place, and the paint difference above the upper is only Hibernia.
There may be other problems facing the Rangers, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when an object was shot in the head and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight shifts to the assembly, which the team had hit Ary and moved to the Scottish league in semifinals.
Holt continued with the Livi 11 assembly, where the team took the score from Hearts last week, and the same strategy once again produced the result when the well-structured composition managed to complain against the opponent almost every turn.
Although Rangers managed to dominate the holding of the ball, Livingston was better off using situations for his own good.
Livingston had the opportunity to score in two minutes when Menga's first pitch gave Scott Pittman a free way to Allan McGregor, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
After that, Keaghan Jacobs directed his free kick to Craig Dikett, but another defenseman Alan Lithgow managed only to kick his ass wide in the back.
On the other hand, the Rangers took control of the game, but in the last third of the game, there was no confidence in the air anymore.
Alfredo Morelos demanded punishment when, in fifteen minutes, he and Steven Lawless had come across each other, but Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
The Rangers managed to try only two goals in the first half. However, the former Ibrox goaltender Liam - the former Ibrax goaltender, Liam  well-rejected the Latin Coulibaly bush and Ovie Ejara's powerless shot.
Livingston's goal at 34 minutes was an unexpected opening, but the situation was not just due to the team's hard work.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything for long feeders from the Lands.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher fed Scott Robinson, who was cold-hearted to the ball Menga for paint.
At Gerrard, Gerrard decided to switch to Coulibaly and put Ryan Kent on the field. The change affected the game as soon as Kent created a suitable opening for Morelos. However, the attack was interrupted by the rapid defense that affected him.
Livingston put the visitors playing again in their own game, while Lithgow and the Splitts continued their long feeds after each other.
The Holt team had the opportunity to raise the lead in the last moments of the game. However, the fine defense of McGregor prevented Jacobs’ intentions before Lithgow got to his position.
Glen Middleton, who came from the Rangers' exchange, also demanded a fined kick after he got together with Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: Geigermeter Inventor
Next page is "Sunday Morning" from our topic: 30 September, 1882. Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, future physicist, was born in Germany this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity. Invented later on, the development of a known device as a geigger surveyer.
The method became one of the models of science, and the instrument is also the key concept of pop culture. For example, the movie "Coronado Watches", published in 1950, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans present the same scientists as the shepherds:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger meter. It's used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put your headphones on your ears, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on minerals."
Evans: "Look, it's really riding now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63st birthday.
An idea that still bears his name is still alive.
The new cancer vaccine is able to teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells of the system.
A new cancer vaccine will be able to teach the immune system to 'see' evil cells and destroy them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system how to recognise malignant cells as part of the treatment.
In the treatment of resistant cells, the patient is isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory.
After treatment, re-injected cells in the body are able to 'see' several eatings of typical proteins.
The computer has produced promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, in a cancer patient with ovarian cancer, the cells disappeared within 18 months after being treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells.
In the process, resistant cells are isolated from the patient and modified in the laboratory so that they are able to 'see' several eating typical HER2 proteins. The modified cells are finally injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "The results show that this is a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "guided growth of several types of cancer", Professor Berzofsky explains. "These include breast cancer and eating of ovaries, lungs and colon."
A similar approach – taking resistance cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells – has also produced results in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into critics' teeth after praising the Olympics on Saturday Night's Eve with a campaign hat on its head.
The proposal was not submitted according to the plans.
Kanye West was hit by a bunch of booms in the Saturday Night Live entertainment program after a blatantly shouted President Donald Trumps and announced that he was looking for president in the 2020 elections.
After presenting his second copy of the evening's "Ghost Town" final Make America Great Again campaign, the West attacked the Democrats and reiterated its support for President Trump.
"When talking to a white person, they ask me how I can support the Trums because he's a racist.
If racism was a problem, I would have changed America a long time ago," he says.
This evening’s mission began with a sketch of Matt Damon’s sneeze at Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing in the Senate Legal Committee. The consultation relates to the arguments put forward by Mr. Blasy Ford on the grounds of sexual harassment by Mr. Kavanaugh.
West roasting was not presented in direct transmission, but Comic Chris Rock downloaded it to a large part of the social media.
It is unclear whether the purpose of the Rock is to mock the West at its post office.
He also complained to the public that he had been treated well because of the hat he thought he had been wearing on the screens.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I shouldn't go to bed with this hat on my head.
I'm tempted.
Then they say that I'm in the loop," West says in an interview with Washington Experimenter.
And then we went on to say, "Do you want to see what it means to be on the margin?" and says, "Well, then you can't tell me what I'm doing. Do you want the world to move forward?"
Love."
According to the Variety, West's comments opened up the appeals to the public at least, and the performers of the show seemed to be embarrassed. One of the present described the situation in the newspaper as follows: "The whole studio went completely quiet."
West was chosen to replace Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
In many viewers, the source of confusion is the presentation of the song "I love it" Perrier dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
You will receive support from Candace Turner, director of the conservative PUSA Organization, who praised this courage in telling you: "Thank you very much.
However, the director of the discussion programme, Karen Hunter, pointed out that West "is only himself, which is once and for all wonderful.
"But I can decide to be a certain person (by buying this music or clothing or by supporting this "art"), which I consider to be a harmful ideology for my community to support and disseminate.
He's a free man.
Don't worry about it," she added.
Räpjér announced before his evening appearance that he was informed that he had changed his name to "person previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name. A musician follows Diddy here, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and, of course, we also remember the late musical legend Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and later as an artist, who was first known as Prince.
The Belfast D.A. will be charged with the attempted murder.
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed on Friday in a restaurant in East Belfast.
The incident happened with the police in the Ballyhackmore area.
The accused is expected to be brought before the Belgian court on Monday.
The prosecution shall be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Actor Star of the Board Game Kit Haring is facing a toxic masculinity of the mindset by the observer star Kit Haring.
Kit Harington is known for his sword-spinning roles as Jon Snow in the violent fantasy series of HBO's Power Game.
Harrington has, however, attacked Machoskar’s stereotype: 31-year-old actor says that such roles give young boys a sense of respect for having to earn a hard work.
In an interview with the cultural association of Sunday Times, Harrington suspects that "someone has gone wrong" and will question the means available to intervene in toxic masculinity during the time of the MeToo phenomenon.
Harrington, who is also a member of the Star Star of the Powers Game, also married to Rose Leslie of 31 years of age, admits that he has a strong desire to address the subject.
"The question of where we've gone wrong with masculinity at the moment makes me feel strong," he says.
"What have men been taught in the years of their growth that have led to the problems that are now being detected?"
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say: "What is internal birth and what is learned?
What do you learn on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be certain to be men?
I think this is one of the great issues of our time – how can we change this?
There is something really wrong with young men."
In the interview, he also admits that he would not participate in the production of pre- and post-game parts after the end of the series next summer, because he said that he was "sufficient with fields and horses".
In November Harrington will be seen in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which will tell us about the film producer and his kickout brother.
The visitor recently revealed that getting acquainted with his future Rose spirit was the best thing that the Board game has offered him.
"I met my wife in this show, so somehow it gave me my future family and my life from then on" she says.
Rose Leslie played Ygritte, the object of the love of Jon Snow by Harrington in Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 to the Leslie family’s premises in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: The number of new infections in China has increased by 14 %.
China has reported an increase in the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-infected citizens by 14 per cent.
According to the health authorities, the virus affects the lives of more than 820,000 people in the country.
Some 40 000 new cases have been reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
A clear majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change in previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to the health authorities of China, which took place at the conference in the Province of Hong Kong, the HIV infection in this way has been reduced to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of HIV infected and AIDS infected in China has risen by 100,000 cases.
HIV infection by sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many diseases are caused by insufficient protection in such a context.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised to guarantee the overall availability of HIV medicines as part of the response to the problem.
Maxine Waters disputes the information of a leaked Republican, accusing the worker of spreading "hazardous lies" and "secret alliances".
Maxine Waters, a member of the House of the United States, contested on Saturday the arguments that his staff would have published personal information on three Republicans on Wikipedia websites concerning them.
The NDC from Los Angeles assured that the claims are disseminated by "extreme right-wing" comments and websites.
"Fairs, lies and more disrespectful lies," says Waters in a statement published on Twitter.
Published information includes the addresses and telephone numbers of Lindsey Graham, the senator representing South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, the senators representing Utah State.
An unknown person provided information from the United States of America on Thursday during the hearing of the Senate Committee. The hearing concerned the accusations of sexual maladministration against the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
This leak occurred a long time after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
The conservative sites, such as Gateway Pounds and RedState, report that, according to the Hill newspaper, messages were published from the IP address associated with the Waters office and from the person belonging to the Waters staff.
"This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and it is an absolute lie," Water continued.
"My staff, whose identity, personal data and security is compromised by these false and false accusations, shall in no way be liable for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and absolutely false."
Waters' opinion was quickly criticised on the Internet, and critics were accompanied by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"The way he disputes this is very hostile," wrote Fleischer.
"It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he has no reason to behave hostilely.
There is no reason to be proud.
There is no reason to question the motives of the D.A.
The situation should be handled in a gentle and calm manner."
Fleischer seemed to compare the reaction of Waters to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during the hearing on Thursday.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who competes for Waters in the mid-term elections in the Congress, has also expressed his views on the subject.
"Unbelievably if this is true," he said.
In its opinion, Waters announced that he had contacted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement authorities for their sincere accusations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," he added, "and that they are legally held accountable for any destructive and dangerous action that may be taken on some or all of my staff members."
Johnny is attacking again – the under-efficient Rowan Atkinson Agent Parod.
There has already been a tradition of looking for Brexit references to any film that is more or less expensive to Britain, but this does not seem to be suitable for Johnny English-agents industry and a series of operations that started in 2003 in the TOL English track and came back to life again in the further part of 2011 "Johny English – Reborn".
Can the tongue become a new British national export success from a nation's satirian made in the cheek?
Either way, cock-eyed, cumbersome and incompetent Magyar English has earned his permission to break it twice. Even his name tells us above all that this is a comic creation directed towards the non-English market.
Of course, it's about that smug secret agent who is desperate to breathe around a melting glamour, but he seems to be a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean, and that unfortunate one-word musician at the opening concert in London in 2012.
The background of this character is the cosmopolitan and the mysterious world man who left chaos behind, which Atkinso originally presented in the forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard.
There is, of course, a moment in the latest performance.
I particularly like the scene where Johnny English arrives on the helicopter with a medium-term suit, and the rotor blades hover his helmet.
The gifts of Atkinson's physical comedy appear to be evident, but the humor itself seems to be under-efficient and strangely unnecessary, especially because ‘serious’ film brands, such as 007 and the dangerous task, are now making fun of themselves as part of the film's fundamental content.
The humor seems to be for the children, and I do not think that I am as ingenious and sharp as Mr. Atkinson's committee of mute roles of Mr. Bean's humor.
The recurring starting point is that the United Kingdom is in trouble more than once every year.
The cyber hacker has infiltrated the British top-secret spy network and exposes the identity of all British agents in the field as a knockout of an agent on the service — which is presented as a unfortunate minor performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop to the Prime Minister, who is already in the hands of a political disadvantage: Emma Thompson is doing everything in the skins of a Teresa May parodia character, but the script does not only provide him with sufficient space.
In informing him that all the spies in the field have been exposed, the intelligence service advisors are soon to invite someone who has already moved away from the active service.
It is, of course, a murky Johnny English in his own person. He spends his retirement as a master of the Master's School, but at the same time he gives informal lessons in the noble art of spying. The topic excels some clever jokes; English holds School of Rock-like lessons in the chambers of intelligence.
English is to be praised for the emergency meeting in Whitehall at which he will meet again with his endless, patient battle Bough, which will continue to be played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine owner whose role Vicki Pepperdine appears to be unable to access her rights.
So the catastrophic Batman and Robin have returned to the secret service of his Majestys in order to meet the fateful supercrime Ophelia Bhuletova of Olga Kurylenko's act.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT-MIr. Jason Volta, acting by Jake Lacy, claims to be able to solve British computer problems.
The Odyssey of English and Bough will soon become a far-reaching festival: the two of us, dressed as waiters, will set fire to a fine French restaurant and will cause chaos in trying to hide the luxury hunters of Volta. The visit to the house of Volta's virtual glasses will result in pure anarchy in the true world.
The last obstacles of the authors are froze at the end of the scene, but even in spite of all the powerlessness and charm, the film still seems to have been made very little for children.
The film can be considered reasonable.
While watching the English films, I have come to the same conclusion: why is it that the British film industry is unable to give Rowan Atkinson a role that would justify his talent?
The British Labour Party disputes plans for a Thursday working week on a five-day salary basis.
Labour, head of Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan for the British to work for four days a week, but the salary would be paid for five days.
The party is told that it requires companies to transfer the savings generated by an intelligent revolution to workers in the form of an extra day off.
It seems that workers could enjoy three days of weekends at the same time.
According to the sources, the idea of ‘approach’ to the economic programme of the party and its plans for a policy of costing workers' lives.
The Trade Union Confederation supports the transition to Thursday's working week as a means for workers to benefit from a changing economic situation.
The source of the high-level labour force reports to the Sunday Times: "Advocating the revision of the billing system before the change of year has occurred.
The change is not immediate, but a Thursday working week is an objective which is consistent with the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of workers and the party's general industrial strategy."
The working party is not the first person to support the idea: the British Green Party committed itself to supporting the transition to Thursday's work week in connection with its 2017 referendum campaign.
However, the objective does not receive indivisible support in the rows of Labour.
The Labour Force Officer notes: "The day-to-day work week is not a party's orientation, and the party does not want to move on to such a move."
Mr John McDonnell, Minister of Finance of the shadow government, took advantage of last week's work conference to present his vision of economic revolution.
McDonnell said that he was determined to recover power from "non-growth dictators" and from "operators" of public utility enterprises.
According to the Minister of Finance of the Board of Directors, current shareholders of water companies would not be able to recover their entire share, as the Board of Directors of Labour could carry out "reductions" on the basis of the errors identified.
He also confirmed the plans to set up employees in the boards of companies and to set up in-depth ownership funds to transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector enterprises to the management of employees, according to which each employee would be paid up to GBP 500 per year as dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy will discuss in the 60-minute programme whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanagh could change their minds.
The investigation into the accusations of the FBI judge Brett Kavanaughi has delayed at least a month's final vote on the appointment of Kavanagh as Supreme Court. The delay also raises the question as to whether the outcome of the investigation could undermine the support of some Republican translators to the Kavanagh designation.
In the 60-minute period of the programme to be sent on Sunday, the programme correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it was possible for the FBI to find out things that would enable them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Well, of course," Kennedy said.
"By the time I heard you... I said I'd talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charges came up, and I asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was determined, determined, unambiguous."
Graham's voice, on the other hand, looks like a stone cut off.
"I've made my decision on Brett Kavanagh and it's bomb-proof," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added to Blasey Ford, referring to Blasey Ford.
"Not one of his names of people was able to confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any other way."
What is Global Citizens Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizenship Festival held in New York on Saturday is a musical event with a performance equal to its mission: the removal of poverty from the world.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizenship Festival is attracting tens of thousands of people to the lawns of the New York Central Park to listen to performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the real goal of the event: the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Power Project, an international consultative group aimed at reducing poverty by increasing the number of people working actively to eliminate poverty.
In order to get a flag to the event (if not willing to pay for the VIP flag) the public must carry out various tasks or "acts" such as voluntary work, send e-mail to the political director or to make a call, or perform any other act that disseminates awareness of the objectives of the project.
But how has Global Citizens been successful, now that the target has been reached for 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people on a free concert ticket a real way to persuade them to take action, or is it just one ‘click’ among others — the idea that the world can be changed by signing a web address or sending a quote?
The Global Citizen announces that it has registered more than 19 million "acts" on behalf of different goals since 2011 onwards.
According to this, these actions have encouraged political decision-makers to declare commitments and principles corresponding to more than $37 billion, which have been used in a way that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, a group listed 390 commitments and declarations on the basis of which more than $10 billion have already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds that have already been achieved have already affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The most important commitments include, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a group of investors and executives in Great Britain, which is committed to helping children develop their full potential. The Group committed to deliver to Rwanda 35 million dollars for the purpose of ending malnutrition in the country. This happened after 4 700 TVs had been sent to them by activists following the Global Citizen campaign.
"With the help of the British government, donors, governments of different countries and just like you, we can transfer social injustice and malnutrition to the history of the press," said the Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, to the public at a concert in London in 2018.
According to the Group, the British Government was also called upon to take action to improve the nutrition of mothers and children by more than 5,000 actions. The government has published funding for a project focused on combating malnutrition on Nutrition to reach 5 million mothers and children.
One of the questions on the website of the movement is: "Why do you think we can put an end to extreme poverty?"
The answer of the global citizen is: "You will be long and hard and many and many conceivable stones are ahead of us.
However, we will succeed, such as the great civil rights struggles and the movements against the apartheid before us because we are stronger together."
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the movement at the New York concert this year, and its stars will include artists such as Janet Jackson, the Week, Shawn Mendes, Card B and Jane Monae.
According to the Ministry of the Interior of the United States of America, the country may impede energy exports by using the fleet as "preventive".
According to the U.S. Minister of Home Affairs Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examier, Washington can "if necessary" use its fleet to help prevent the proliferation of energy in the world market, including those close to the world market.
Zinke claims that Russia's action in Syria – at the invitation of the legal government – is an excuse for the new energy market to be marked by a new market in the region.
"I believe that the fault of being in the Middle East is energy transmission, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe," says Zinken.
According to the Authority, methods and means are available to prevent this happening.
"The United States has the ability to keep voyages open through its fleet and, if necessary, by encircling it to ensure that the energy they provide does not reach the world market" he says.
Zinke spoke to the public about the event organised by the Energy Consumers' Association, which is a non-profit group that is being profiled as "energy consumers' loudspeaker" in the United States.
He continued by comparing Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran by pointing out that this is one and the same thing.
"Iran and Russia's economic alternative is more or less speculation and replacing fuel", he says, and describes Russia as "one trick as a circus number", the economy based on fossil fuels.
Opinions are due to the situation where the more favourable regime has sought to enhance the efficiency of the export of LNG to Europe and thus to replace the much more favourable gas for LNG.
In order to enhance this, the Trump regime, including President Trump, will attempt to persuade Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to President Trump will tie Berlin to Moscow’s retreat.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed Nord Stream 2 as a purely economic project, which aims to double the transmission capacity of the existing tube of 110 billion cubic metres.
The Kremlin claims that there are purely economic reasons behind Washington's opposition, and considers that this is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers must have the possibility to choose their supplier", says the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak after meeting the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The attitude of the United States has led to a counter-reaction in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial umbrella organisation in the country, the German Industrial Federation, has called on the United States to stay separate from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I find it very problematic that a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, Director of the Federal Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, and the President of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, who spoke recently after meeting with the German Federal Chancellor, Mr. Angela Merkel and the President of the Russian Federation, Mr. Vladimir Putin.
Mr Warren, Senator Massachusetts, is planning to carefully consider "a candidate for presidential elections in 2020.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts announced that he would be presidential candidate after the mid-term elections that he would "be careful".
Warren is convinced to plan to apply for an open questionnaire in Holyok, Massachusetts, Massachusetts.
"It is time for women to move to Washington and correct our poor government, and this also means a woman at the head of the world", he said according to The Hill.
"After the sixth day of November, I will carefully consider becoming a presidential candidate."
Mr. Warren estimates President Donald Trump at the occasion by saying that "he is going to take the country in the wrong direction.
"I am concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he says.
Warren has been literally critical of Mr. Trump and the candidate for this Supreme Court, Mr. Brett Kavanaugh.
In his suite published on Friday, Warren wrote, "Of course we need a FBI examination before the vote.
However, according to the opinion published on Thursday, a majority of Warren's voters are not in favour of this appointment in 2020.
According to the University of Suffolk's policy research facility and the study carried out by Boston Globe, 58% of 'probable' voters in Massachusetts are not in favour of the appointment of a senator.
32% were in favour of running for candidates.
Among the respondents to the questionnaire, the majority supported the position of former Governor Deval Patrick as a candidate for 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
For example, the previous vice-president, Joe Biden, and the Senator of Vermont, Bernie Sanders, are former Vice-President and Senator of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden has said that he has decided to apply by January of January.
Sarah Palin refers to her son's war tours at Donald Lake's event at a meeting in Donald Worm.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined the armed forces in September.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday night, and he was charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son will have to go through when he comes home I can be very fond of other families who will face the consequences of the PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers are carrying," he told the audience in Tulsa, Oklahoma Donald Trump, Oklahoma, to the election meeting in Donald Trump.
The firer called the arrest ‘a live horse in the living room’ and said his son, like other war veterans, ‘palating in the face of change, they return hardened, they come back to think about whether we respect what he and his fellows in the army and in the air force have done for the good of this country’.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska. According to Dan Bennett, an officer of the Wasilla Police, he was charged with domestic violence and assault against a woman, and domestic violence and the treatment of a gun intoxicated.
18 states and the Columbia Union support the action brought against the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the Columbia Union are seeking a change to a new policy that has entered into force in the United States, according to which asylum is not granted to people seeking gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the Federation have lodged a letter of the right of friends in Washington on Friday, which supports asylum seekers who are in violation of the line of command, reports NBC News.
The full name of the administrator has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace vs. Sessions complaint brought by the American Civil Freedoms Union against the federal policy in August.
He tells of the abuses of his partner's "and his sons in violent gangs". The US authorities doubted him of asylum on 20.7.
He was arrested in Texas.
The good public prosecutor described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, most of which are from countries where gang and family violence are a widespread problem for society at all levels.
The new US asylum policy reversed the decision taken by the Complaints Board of Asylum in 2014 to allow paperless immigrants to apply for asylum on the basis of domestic violence.
In his opinion on this Friday, the General Prosecutor of Columbia's Federation, Karl Racine, commented that a new line "is ignored by the state, the federal state and international law for decades.
"The law of a Member State requires all applications for asylum to be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances on the basis of which the application is based, and such an obstacle infringes this principle" says the letter of the Court of Justice.
In the letter, the prosecutors also claim that the practice that prevents access to asylum is damaging to the US economy because the arrivals are likely to become entrepreneurs and "import the necessary additional labour force".
The Public Prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, in June, ordered entry judges to stop victims of domestic violence and gang violence from giving asylum to the victims of asylum.
"The place of refuge is intended for persons who are fleeing their home country for persecution or fear of belonging to race, religion, nationality or a particular social class or political opinion."
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems — even serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Unsuspected survivals occur in Palu – the number of deaths found has already doubled.
The situation for the survivors becomes even more serious.
"Your house is very busy," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma when she becomes bored of the hot baby Please at the evacuation centre in the decommissioned city.
"Emergency will bring a minute's new body to a new body.
Clean water is low."
The residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up water from their goods, and try to save what is yet to be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured and 7.5 hospitals damaged by the magnetized quake are full.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who suffered from vertebral and shoulder fractures, rest outside the army hospital, where patients are treated for persistent, severe seismic attacks.
His eyes will be filled with tears when he repeats how a frantic earthquake shaken the five-storey hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't make it.
I was stuck in the cracks between the ruins of the wall, I guess." Harris tells me what the Associated Press said and tells me that he was with his family in town as a wedding guest.
"I heard my wife screaming for help and then came silent.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The Western Ambassador accuses China of "provocation" with "propaganda declarations".
The Chinese Ambassador accused Beijing of using the US newspaper as a propaganda tool. This is the case a week after the Chinese newspaper had published in the US daily newspaper ad of four pages, praising the mutual interests of the US-China Trade Agreement.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Dump referred to the item of China Daily in Des Moines Register, which is the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of interference with the Congress elections held on 6.11.
A more realistic accusation of attempts by Beijing to interfere with the US elections, according to the U.S. authorities that spoke to Reuters, marks a new stage in the Washington expanding campaign to pressure China.
Although it is normal for a foreign government to spread notices to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an ever-exploited war of trade, in which both parties will, in turn, impose customs duties on the export products of the counterparty.
According to Chinese and American experts, the Chinese retaliation tariffs were targeted at states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of the Trump at the beginning of the trade war.
Terry Branstad, Chinese Ambassador and long-term Governor of Iowa, says that Beijing has done damage to the working population, to farmers and to companies in the United States. Iowa is a major exporter of agricultural products to China.
China is now speeding up its provocations by further publishing propaganda notices in our own free press," said Branstad in its opinion paper published in Sunday's Des Moines Register.
"By taking advantage of its propaganda, the Government of the United States benefits from the prestigious traditions of free word and press by making a payment notice in the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
"However, different opinions can be seen only in a limited way in the press about the streets of Peking, and the real, different opinions that Chinese citizens can have about the alarming development of their economies, which is due to the fact that the media is very closely in the middle of the Chinese Communist Party," he writes.
Branstad will continue to say that "one of the largest newspapers in China was against the publication of the offer" article he wrote, but it does not specify what the magazine is about.
Kavanaugh-fiasko deports female voters from Republicans, analysts warn against this.
According to the analysts, the fact that many of the Republican leaders stand behind Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court Judge’s candidate, and defend him, may result in counter-reaction, particularly with the female voters, in the forthcoming elections.
The feelings surrounding the incident have gone on major rounds, and most Republicans have already announced that they want to make a vote.
"These things cannot be reversed", says State Professor Grant Reeher of the Maxwell Institute of the University of Syracuse in the article published on Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher does not believe that Senator Jeff Flaken (Republicans, Arizona)'s last-minute offer of the FBI investigation would reassure angry voters.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and informant of the National Reform Team MoveOn this weekend according to the newspaper in the capital.
On Friday morning, the protestors announced that "the coming is coming" in their opinion when the ruling Republicans of the Board of Justice decided to take part in the appointment of Kavanaugh, which happened despite the statement by Dr. Stephan Blasy Ford, Mic reports.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be predictable", says Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst in interviewing the website.
"Man says that enthusiasm has already been high, and that's true.
But it could be even greater, especially among the nearby uncertain female voters and the younger voters, 18 to 29, who often do not vote because they do not like the President."
Analysts anticipate a possible counter-reaction if the Republicans proceed with the confirmation, even before the Ford Dialogue against the Supreme Court candidate, in which he put forward his claim of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former President of the National Committee of the Republican National Committee, NBC News at the beginning of last week.
"This is not just about the vote of the Committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is to be called into question; it is about how the Republicans have acted and how they have treated Fordia", Guy Cecil, the head of the Group of the Progressives Group of the Alliance of Democrats, pointed out to the news feeder.
However, the Americans seem somewhat uncertain as to whether they should have faith in Ford or Kavanaghi’s testimony in the light of a slight majority’s tendency to the latter’s point of view.
According to a new opinion by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe in Ford's testimony, definitely or most likely, whereas 35% say that they believe in Kavanaughi or are likely to believe in Kavanaughi.
In addition, 38% say that Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied in his witness statement, whereas only 30% say the same thing about Ford.
In response to Flaken's case, the FBI investigates Ford and at least one other accusations by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian's report.
Ford testified before the Committee on Legal Affairs by oath to Kavanaugh, accusing him of being drunk when Ford was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate for membership revealed to him his family at a student party in his hometown while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
World Wide Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet response to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has launched a start-up company designed to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source SOlid base of the Berners-Lee open source code.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to any information.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee is joking about the purpose of Inrupt's "governance of the World".
"It must be done now", he said referring to his startup attempt.
"This is a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal data storage" or "POD".
It may contain contact lists, catalogues, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It is like Google Drive, jw.org, Slack and Spotify all available on one browser at the same time.
In the personal dataset, it is unique that it is entirely up to the user, who has access to what type of data.
The company calls it "to enter into force by means of information".
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inruptin is to provide resources, processes and the skills required to bring Solid to everyone's attention.
The company currently comprises a safety platform purchased by Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some of the employees who work with the project and a community of voluntary entrants.
Technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website. This is available from this week on.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing "with Facebook and Google about whether people will be offered a perfect change in which all their business patterns will be turned around overnight.
"We do not ask for their consent to the matter."
In its article published on Wednesday, Berners-Lee wrote in the Inruptin that "is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem for the unity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee had the Internet created by the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology University.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee maintains its position as founder and director of the World Wide Web consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute, including after the launch of Inrupt.
"I am extremely optimistic in view of the next period of the network," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The city remembers World War I’s Fleet of the First World War.
The city is admiring the only priest awarded by the English Church on the Victoria Cross medal, who has been a soldier since 100 years since the events took place.
On 29 September 1818, following the attacks on the villages of Bellellenglis and Lehaucourt, it was given to Reverend Bernard Vann, Colonel.
However, the oath died of a sniper who was created four days later, without ever knowing what he had learned of the highest honors of the British army.
Two of his grandchildren were exposed to a monumental stone at a parade in Rühhden, Northamptonshire last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says that the event is "an impressive symbolic"; the symbol was revealed exactly 100 years after the execution of his rewarded grandfather.
According to London Gazetti, 29 9.1918 Colonel Vann led his Battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quent "in a very dense fog and under the fire of heavy field cannons and machine guns."
Later on, he rushed to the front line and "the greatest fairness show" led the troops to advance before the raiding alone on the field tank. In the subsequent battle, Vann poured with his own hands three cannon batteries into the army.
Colonel Vann's death of a German sniper was created on 4 October 1818 – only a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's act was "something that I could never achieve, something that would bring respect to me."
Michael Vann He took his brother Dr James Vann to the stand after the parade with the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band orchestra.
Michael Vann says that it is "a great pleasure to be able to participate in the parade" and added, "The great crowd of men is in the memory of the glory of a true hero."
The friends of the competition were waiting all night for the Bellator 206 tournament – the television show looked like Pipsa Possu.
Imagine the situation where you have been watching all night to watch the expected Bellator 206 tournament, and not the entire event of the presentation.
There were 13 matches in the event in San José, of which six matches in the main series, and the show was scheduled to be broadcast live on Channel 5 in Britain.
In the morning, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the round, the program changed to a major shock for the viewers of Pippa Possuu.
Some viewers were not really happy to take part in all night shopping.
One of the friends of the free play opened up to replace the match described in the Twitter with a description of the public as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to the law, the content in question was not appropriate for presentation at 2:00 a.m., so they had to change it to a child's program" explained Dave Schwartz, Deputy Director of Marketing and Communication, Bellator's own Deputy Director for Marketing and Communications.
"Pisa Possu, yes."
Scott Coker, Director of Bellator Company, said that the timetables would be working so that British viewers could follow events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a new mission that will probably make the program work," Coker said.
"It is, however, six o'clock in the morning, and we will not receive the programme until we reach our time, which in turn will be Monday at their time.
We are working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their heads, messages began to go in the direction and to one another, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to correct the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case, but it was a legal matter.
I promise you, next time this will not happen.
We limit the number of matches to five in six, as usual. We tried to offer more to our fans and tried too much.
This is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discussions: Tom Daley felt inferior to himself because of his sexuality.
The swimmers and Olympic athlete Tom Daley tells us that he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
A 24-year-old athlete tells me that he only found out when he came to high school that "not everyone is the same as me."
On the "Desert Island Discs" programme of the Radio 4-channel "Desert Island Discs" by Lauren Laverine, Daley says that he has spoken about the rights of the gay people to give to others "to wish".
He also tells us how winning after having a child at the Olympics is no longer so important.
Kristy Young, the permanent director of the long-term radio programme, has taken a month's leave of absence due to illness.
When presenting as a guest in the first programme of Laverne, Daley told me that she felt ‘less’ than everyone else because ‘it was not socially acceptable to like boys and work’.
He says: "To this day, these feelings, feel smaller and different have been the reality, and they have given me the power and energy that I have needed for my success."
He says that he wants to show that he is ‘ somewhere’ that he does not disappoint everyone when his sexuality is finally revealed.
A double Olympic bronze medal player has become a high profile LGBT activist, and he is in this year's National Community competitions attracting the criminalisation of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without penalties, and wanted to give ‘to others’ hope.
The three-time world universe tells of its incarnation to a man — the American filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "as another surprise."
Daley got married to this self 20 years with the senior winner last year, but says that the age gap has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things when you are so young" – he attended his first Olympics at 14 years of age and his father died three years later – "it is difficult to find another of the same kind who would have experienced similar experiences and conflicts," Daley says.
The district received a son in June – Robert Ray Black-Daley – following which Daley's "total rule" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been around winning gold medals," he says.
"You know, there are more things than all the Olympic Games.
Robbie is one of my Olympic gold medals."
Her son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 only 40 years of brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted his death, and one of the last things he asked Daley about the 2012 Olympic flags, and he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I could not tell him that he would no longer be there to be on the front line," Daley says.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped. Not until she had truly stopped breathing and she was dead, I realized at last that she was not vulnerable," she says.
The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew this was something that I've been dreaming about all my life - jumping in front of the home audience at the Olympics, and there's no better feeling," Daley says.
This was also an inspiration for his first copy of the series – the song "Proud" by Heather Stell – which made him feel already preparing for the Olympics and who still gets his skin on the heel.
Desert Island Discs will be sent to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The popular Mickelson exchange bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday's Ryder Cup.
U.S. Phil Mickelson breaks the record on Sunday with his 47th Ryder Cup round, but he has to make a great deal of effort to avoid a record turn in the history of a unfortunate proposal.
Mr. Mickelson, who, in the event that is being played every two years, recorded the record 12 times, went to the exchange bench by Jim Furyk on the occasion of the four-ball and the four-games to be played on Saturday night.
In general, the American five-time Major Tournament winner, who is the center of attention, now spent half the day as a cheerleader and on the other side trying to get his shot.
Mickelson, 48-year-old, who is not even at the top of his career, is not the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National field, where a long-term roughness punishes incorrect hits.
If there is not enough resistance to Mickelson in the field itself, the 9th game on Sunday will be against the well-known British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play together with the newcomer, Mr Fleetwood, who will aim to bring in all four victory tubes this week.
If the Americans who are four points behind the 12 double games receive a flying departure, the Michelson game may prove extremely important.
Furyk has expressed confidence in his player, but what else could you say in this situation?
"He fully understands the role he played today. He killed me on the back, routinely and said he was ready for tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is indisputably one of the best players and has brought so much to the news in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I was thinking about something else, but here's what went on, and that's the kind of decision we ended up with.
He wants to be in the same field as anyone else."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record of more played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also lead to the end of a man’s Ryder Cup career, which, though, was never comparable to his personal performance.
Mickelson has 18 profits, 20 losses and seven half, but according to Fury, his presence brings something undefined to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's clever, he's at the expense of people for fun, and he's a funny guy who everybody likes to be with," he explains.
"The younger players must have had a good time with him this week. It must be fun to watch.
He brings so much more to the team than mere stakes in the game."
The captain of the European team, Thomas Bjorn, knows how long the leadership can disappear quickly.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, is aware of the experience that Ryder Cup's vast leadership before the last day's double-games can come on a rough journey.
A Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where Seve Ballesteros led a five-point lead in relation to the Americans, but who survived as the winner on the slopes just and just by its own measure and won at the best possible margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds us how we were running in Valderrama, we were driving in a long way in Brookline, where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit a little," said Bjorn after looking at the 2018 team's 5-to-three winnings in both the Friday and yesterday, moving to the 10-6-director Le Golfq field.
History will prove to me and to all other team members that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow we'll shoot with a big caliber.
We go to the field and do everything right.
The game will not be over until the numbers are on board.
We have a goal, we are trying to win that prize, and that's all we're aiming at.
As I have always said, I will focus on these 12 players who are playing for us, but we are aware of what is opposite: the best players in the world."
Glad to see how his team's players have done a difficult job, Bjorn adds: "I will never lick until I drop in on such things.
The whole thing is completely different.
The first thing tomorrow is individual performances, and then we'll talk about different things.
It is wonderful to be in the field with a partner when everything is going well, but when the field is on its own, the player’s capacity will be tested to the bottom.
This is the message that must be sent to the players – tomorrow everyone will be able to perform the best performance.
Now we have to give up a partner who can go to [on the field alone] and do his best."
Unlike Bjorn, the opponent’s Captain Jim Furyk comes with a better performance for each individual than they could as partners, the exception being ING Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk in turn has experienced the turn of the last day in both directions, and he was involved in a team that won in Brookline before he became a loser when the European team won "Medinah by wonder".
"I remember every word of evil," he answered the question of how the 1999 team by the King Ben Crenshaw shared their team with the last day's performances.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a fast start just as happened in Brookline, or as happened in Medinah.
When it comes to finding out in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We have made our arrangements accordingly, and we will put the boys in the field in the manner we want to do, as you know, we will do miracles tomorrow."
Pauly, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are in order to meet their European opponents.
"I put the guys of the group in this order, because I think it's carrying through the whole tournament," Bjorn commented on his dual-game choices.
The new warship will be delayed again.
The German fleet's newest frigate should have been introduced in 2014. The ship's aim is to replace an ageing vehicle in the cold weather, but it will be put in place at the earliest next year due to defective systems and explosively increasing costs, with local media reporting.
According to the report of the military press on Dieit, the first vessel of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate class ‘Rheinland-Pfalzin’ has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the worrying supply problems have been amazeed by an ambitious project.
The vessels of the four Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the fleet in 2007 are intended to replace the ageing Bremen class frigates.
According to the available information, they are equipped with efficient cannons, missile systems for the fight against air and surface vessels, as well as satellite technology, such as radar reflectivity and technology that reduces the detection of infrared and acoustic signals.
The main features of the ship include its longer range of maintenance – new Frogs should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without visiting the port of origin between the port of origin and the port of origin.
However, the long-term delays mean that warships at the top of the technique, which are intended to improve Germany's influence in the overseas regions, are already obsolete as they enter the service, notes Die Zeit.
The bad F125-flegate ended up in the headlines last year when the German Republic officially refused to start the operation and sent it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the vessel returns the ship after it has been delivered.
There is little knowledge of the reasons for the return, but the German media has talked about the essential "software and device defects" that make the war a mission that is not valid for the warship.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because the crew size of the Baden-Württemberg class crew is around 120, which is only half of the crew of the previous Bremen-class Fleets.
It has also appeared that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the opportunities of the vessel to later updates.
Rheinland-Pfalz, which has a capacity of 7 000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the corresponding class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
There is also a problem with the price list of the whole project, in addition to incomplete installations, as well as the problem of the whole project.
The price is multiplied by an increase of EUR 3,1 billion to the shocking amount when the original price was EUR 2,2 billion.
The problems with the introduction of new Flegates have emerged as the German maritime authorities are rarely warned to shrink.
Hans-Peter Bartels, Director of the Parliamentary Committee on Defence of the European Parliament, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's authorised vessels "are running at a minimum.
According to the authorities, the problem has grown over time because old ships have been decommissioned but have not been replaced by new ones.
He complained that no Flegate of the Baden-Württemberg class could have been introduced into the fleet.
The organisation will listen to the bats' secret life.
A new study in the area above Scotland is seeking to find out how bats exploit the landscape in their hunting for food.
It is hoped that the new research will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and guide in future protection measures.
A survey carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland has been conducted to monitor drapes and dwarves, as well as earts and waterdrops in the Invevevewe Garden of the greenhouse in Wester Ross.
In the future, special storage equipment will be set up for important sites in the region to monitor the operation of bats during the period.
The employees and volunteers of the organisation also carry out mobile measurements using the monitoring equipment to be carried out.
The frequencies of the sounds and the types that are involved are ensured by the analysis of the experts.
On the basis of the results, a plan and report on the habitat shall be drawn up in which the behaviour of bats can be presented in a scaled picture of the area.
Robwar, the organisation's nature advisor, hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are the most important to bats, and how different species use them.
The knowledge is helpful in the development of habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, so that bats and related species are taken into account.
In the last 100 years, the population in Scotland and in the United Kingdom as a whole has fallen significantly over the last hundred years.
Building and agricultural work threatens the resting places and habitats of bats.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as well as fly papers and certain chemicals used in building materials and attacks by pet cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to the green hunting practices, their ears will be of greater benefit to catch fishing than to eye.
Bats use advanced echoing techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organisation focused on the protection of the environment of the countryside, which maintains more than 27 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of areas across the country — and they take bats seriously.
Its staff is composed of ten experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks at rest places and, in some cases, rescue operations for animals.
The organisation has even established the first and only site for the protection of bats in Scotland for the land of the land of Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of the ten bat oils in Scotland are to be found in the area.
According to the nurse David Thompson, the area is ideal for bats.
"Threave is very good for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good environment.
We do not know all about bats yet, so our work here and in other areas of the organization will help us to understand better what bats need to succeed."
He stresses the importance of reviewing buildings in the event of bats prior to taking up conservation measures, as the loss of one bat’s resting place may unintentionally lead to the death of up to 400 female bats and young children and the destruction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and their killing, harassment or destruction of resting places is prohibited.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the bat protection organisation, encourages the public to participate in the protection work.
He says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we still don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo disputes rape charges while lawyers are preparing a case against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has stamped the rape charges against him as "the news" and says that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
The lawyers of Ronaldo have taken action against the grounds of appeal against the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The opponent of Portugal and Juvenus has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the Lasvegasi hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid the victim $375 000 for silence, Der Spiegel reporting on a Friday.
Ronaldo appeared only hours after the submission of the arguments to 142 other followers at Instagram. A 33-year-old observer strongly rejected the accusations and described them as "a false".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they've said today, false news," the five-time Ball d'Or winner said to the camera.
"They just want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for using my name, it's part of this profession.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing the case for Der Spigeel's appeal against the arguments they have referred to as "inadequate reporting on the issues covered by privacy protection" according to the Reuters News Office.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says that the player demands "for spiritual suffering according to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is reported to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel Suite in Las Vegas.
Ronaldo and Mayora are reported to have met in a nightclub and moved to the player's room, where they claim to have raped this anally, according to the documents submitted to the Nevada Clark County Court of Justice of the Region.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo has fallen to his knees after the alleged event and has reported that he was a 99 % good guy, but whose "one %" disappointed him.
According to the documentation, Ronaldo has confirmed that a couple had sex, but that it was mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that he visited the police station and took photographs of his injuries at the hospital, but later he decided to resolve it because he was "horrid about the possibility of revenge" and fears that he would "be the subject of public humiliation".
The 34-year-old is now saying that he is seeking annulment of the conciliation procedure because he is still traumatised about the alleged event.
Ronaldo was close to the agreement to move to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overthrow of the United States, and went to the Italian major team in Jutsa for a $100 million contract.
Brexit: United Kingdom "to regret forever" completion of the car manufacturing process.
The UK would "be on the street forever" if it were to lose its position as the world's leading car manufacturer after the Brexite, Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he considered the notification by the British department of Tokyo to temporarily suspend production at a factory near Derby in Bernaston, near Derby, if Britain withdraws from the EU without a contract.
"We need a deal," Clark says.
The Japanese car manufacturer says that the effects of the restrictions on the loss of visible jobs if the Brex comes to an end without the agreement.
The plant in Burnston, which is producing the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, manufactured nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My point is that if Britain is to leave the EU suddenly at the end of March, there will be interruptions in our production," says Marvin Cooke, CEO of the Toyota Brnaston department.
Other car manufacturers in Britain, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about the European Union leaving the EU in terms of how cross-border trade will operate.
The BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its factory for one month in order to complete the Brexite.
According to the car manufacturers' report, the main concern concerns the supply chain related risks in the implementation of the non-contractual Brexite.
The production line of Toyota is run on a timely JOT principle, where parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in Britain and the EU, and cars are made from order.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may cause interference at the border, which, according to the sector, could lead to delays and difficulties in parts.
Keeping a day-to-day storage at Derbyshire is impossible according to Toyota and production would be discontinued.
Clark says that Theresa May's EU relations plan is "to precisely calibrated to require these controls at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement, which not only means success in the current situation, but is an opportunity that we need to take advantage of", he says in the BBC Radio 4 Today Programme.
"not only the statements made by Toyota, but also by other manufacturers, show that we must be able to continue the very well-functioning supply chain series so far."
Toyo can't tell us how long production will be stopped, but warn us that additional costs will reduce the company's competitiveness and eventually cause job losses.
Peter Ts Republicris, who has worked in Burnasto for 24 years and is a trade union operator at the factory, says among the growing members: "The jobs lost in my experience will never come back.
The editor of the Board of Directors says: "We need to be precise and credible about our future relations with the EU."
Final meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announced.
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein may be "to be transferred one more month" to the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, around the court-martial duty, announced the White House on Sunday.
Mr. Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who in turn will investigate Russia's interference with the elections, the association of the Trumpic aides with Russia and any action by the President to prevent justice.
In Washington, it has been rumored for months that the Trump plan to fire the Deputy Minister of Justice, which would jeopardise the party's investigation into Mueller.
More recently this month, the New York Times reports to Rosenstein on the very possibility of dubious conversations with Trump, and on the possibility of the President being expelled on the basis of the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has contested the report's information.
Mr. Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting has been reported to have been Mr. Rosenstein resigned from office.
However, President Trump was at the time visiting the United Nations in New York, so the date of the meeting was announced on Thursday.
Trump said that he would "not preferably" differ from Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it was in line with the meeting of the Senate's Legal Committee, where Kavanaugh and one of his accused women, Dr. Blasy Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI's week-long study into the arguments against Kavanaugh, which continued to postpone the vote in the Senate plenary session.
The most famous press officer Sarah Sanders was present in Fox News on Sunday.
On the question of Mr. Rosenstein's meeting, Sanders said: "The number of days has not been set. It could be next week, this week, it can still be postponed on account of everything else due to what is currently in the Supreme Court at present.
But I always want to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists might disagree with this argument: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since 10 September.
Newcomer Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says that the reason for the media's lack of awareness is due to other reasons, other than the hatred of the TV operators' "supervisory search", but said, "I do not deny the fact that they are obsessive."
Sanders, however, let us understand that the direct contacts between Trump and the press will be repeated.
"The President holds more Question Time than any president before him", he says, and adds further evidence without quoting, "We've checked those numbers."
"The press conferences will continue to be organised", Sanders said, but "it is extremely much better if the media have the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States than to discuss them with me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do this many times over the last few weeks, and this will replace the press release so that you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump will regularly answer questions when visiting the White House or participating in open events or press meetings with visiting officials.
It is rare to perform alone at the press conference.
This week in New York, in New York, the President may have shown the reasons for this occurrence to the irregularly and at times oddly met journalists.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to the Scottish public health system (NHS Scotland) coming from EU countries regarding concerns about Brex.
The Minister for Health has written a letter from workers from EU countries from the Scottish healthcare system to inform them of their gratitude and hope to remain in the country after the Brex.
Scottish Member Jeane Freeman sent a letter while the United Kingdom's exit from the EU is less than six months away from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already prepared to cover the costs of applications for 'stabilised status' of EU citizens working in specialised public services.
In his letter Freeman writes as follows: During summer, the break-up negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU have continued to take place in the near future.
The Government of the United Kingdom has also stepped up the preparations for any difference in agreement between the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom.
I know that for all of you these are uncertain times.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of each of our employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercromy due to the head injury of an emergency operation.
The supporter of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Christion Abercromie, has been in emergency after the team was destroyed 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, reports to the Tennessee supplier Mike Organ.
Rod Reed, Head Coach of Tennessee State, told journalists that the injury had occurred just before the mid-term.
"He came to the side and simply fell into it," Reed says.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen at the side edge before putting her on pairs and taking her to the side for a more detailed assessment.
Tennessee State’s operator told Chris Harris that Abercrombie had been obtained from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
Harris added that "there is no information on the type/wideness of the damage at this point" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercromie is a second-year student at Tennessee State University and plays the first through the team after his transfer from Illinois.

A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when they buy real estate in Great Britain.
A higher stamp tax will be levied on foreign buyers when they buy real estate in Great Britain. The extra money will be used to help the conservatives help the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party.
The aim of the amendment is to neutralise the success of Corby in attracting young voters.
The introduction of a stamp tax applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to £120 million a year — to help the homeless.
Theresa May will inform foreign buyers today of a higher stamp tax on their purchase of real estate in Great Britain. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The measure will be called upon to neutralise the efforts of Jeremy Corby as an undertaking to attract young voters. Corby has made promises of cheaper housing and has paid attention to the tax of those with a good income.
The increase in the stamp tax is directed at people and companies that do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom. The extra money from this will be channelled into government actions to help ease the suffering of homeless people.
The premium, which is to be added to the current stamp tax, in addition to the increases in the number of second dwellings and residential residences added two years ago, may be up to 3%.
The Minister of Finance expects an increase of GBP 120 million each year.
An estimated 13% of London's new buildings are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and makes it difficult for household buyers to access property housing markets.
Many wealthy areas in the United Kingdom, especially its capital, have changed to ‘avetown’ because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The line comes only weeks after Boris Johnson presented a reduction in the stamp tax as a means of facilitating the purchase of housing for young people.
He accused large construction companies of keeping real estate prices at a high level by buying and leaving the land unscathed, and called on Prime Minister Maya to abandon low-cost housing quotas for the repair of the British 'dangerous situation of residence'.
Corby has published a significant series of proposals for the reform of the housing market, including restrictions on rents and the termination of 'responsible decisions'.
He would also like to give the council more power in matters related to the construction of new dwellings.
Prime Minister May says: "I told you last year that I was going to own my British dream of restoring every generation's life better than its successors.
This means correcting our broken housing markets.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be right that persons who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as companies located abroad, can buy housing as easily as busy British residents can.
For too many people, home ownership has become a far too far-reaching dream, and the shadow of homelessness remains a reality."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scottish national team."
Sunderland's leader, Jack Ross, says that his "the ultimate goal" is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point in time.
A 42-year-old Scot has been excited by the challenge of raising the north-east corner of the country to return to its feet. The team is currently ranked at the British Second Division.
Ross moved to the "light stadium" this summer after he had directed St Mirren back to the Scottish election last month.
"As a client, I wanted to play my country on the team.
I got into the second team and that's it," Ross says at the BBC: Scotland's Sports Sound.
"When I was a child, I often looked at my father's Scottish games with the Hampden, and that's something that's always pulled me back.
Opportunity will only be met if it is the headmaster of the Society of Success.
Ross' successors, Sunderland's manager include Dick Advoat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Head of Allo Athletic says that I was not concerned about entering the boots of his well-known followers with his name on their boots. He has previously rejected the offers made by Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
"At present, my own success is whether or not I can restore this association's electoral power.
On the basis of the structure and capacity of the Society, it is certainly one of the electors", he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably consider myself a success only if I get my team back in the round."
Ross has only served as manager for three years: first as Dumbarton's Deputy Director-General and then for 15 months after being in the Heats coach group.
He then helped Allo to rise from the three-series fall games and raised St Mirren's fall condition to be champions during the next period.
Ross says he feels better now than ever in the teams of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical during his career.
"I was probably on a road trip with my career," he recalls the time when he moved to the head of Alta.
"I truly believe that I was better suited to being a manager than I was to be a player.
It sounds strange because I played well, I made a fair fortune and I got to enjoy some relatively great successes.
However, hunting can be rough.
The player must be able to find out about a lot of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like stress and pressure from work, but leading a team seems like the right thing to do.
I always want to lead the team, and now I'm doing my job, and I feel better in my own body than I ever did in my adult life.

The thermal wave of the summer has fired the pubs struggling with the difficulties of Britain, but at the same time increased pressure on the chain of markets.
According to statistics, the sales of pubs and chains increased by 2.7% in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, a business consultant from CGA, says: "The continuous sunny weather and the longer than expected participation in the World Cup of England meant that July was the figure of 2.8% higher when pubs such as June were sold, while the month was worse.
The fall in June of 1.8% in restaurants sales only got worse in July.
The pubs and bars concentrated on the drinking side were best successful and their like-for-line sales increased more than the fall in the sales of restaurants.
The lateral pubs also suffer from heat, but less dramaticly than the operators of the restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to drink out of their minds.
Sales of pubs and bar drinks by companies increased by 6.6% during the month and the sales of food products by 3%."
Paul Newma, of the RSM company providing leisure and hotel restaurant consulting services, says: "The results will continue to follow a trend that has continued since the end of April.
Weather and major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors affecting the sale of the domestic food market.
It is no surprise that the food chain struggles are continuing, even if the fall in annual sales of 4.8% is rising, especially now that the sector is struggling with the current cost pressure.
The hot summer could not have come to the worse seam for the food-focused operators, and only time seems to bring lively warmer temperatures to the breathing break in the sector that is desperately needed.
The total overall increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new open shops, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the creation of new brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker is the next barometer to sell the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry, which collects and analyses results in 47 areas from a group with a total turnover of more than 9 billion pounds, considered to be a reliable measure for the sector.
One-fifth of children secret social media accounts from their parents.
A fifth of children, some up to 11 years of age, keep secret social media accounts from their parents and teachers, reports the survey.
A study of 20,000 university students revealed the existence of an increasing ‘Instagram feikkitilinen’ phenomenon.
The news gave rise to the concern that the accounts can be divided into sexual content.
20% of the student said that he liked the ‘head-to-head’, which is shown to parents.
A fifth of children, some of whom are up to 11 years old, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students in higher education revealed the rapidly growing existence of ‘Instagram feikkitilien’, which refers to the website for the distribution of images.
The news has raised concerns about the possibility of publishing a sexual content on the accounts.
20% of students told them that they considered the cleaned ‘head account’ to be a show to parents while using other private, private accounts.
One mother found messages written by a teenager, in which she hoped she would be raped after encountering the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter.
In a study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Regional Council (HMC), it was found that 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 kept two separate profiles and half of respondents admitted to keeping secret accounts.
M. Buchanan, Director of HMC, says: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to set up networks where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilith Doyle from "The voice of athletes" to the Scottish government of athletes in Scotland.
Eilith Doyle has been elected as a member of the management board of Scottish athletes, who participates in the annual General Assembly of the Governing Body.
Doyle is the most prized public athlete in Scotland. Chairman of the Board of Directors, Ian Beattie, describes the name as a great opportunity for sports decision-makers to benefit from the extensive, international experience gathered by the athlete over the last decade.
"The successes of yesterday will be huge among athletes in Scotland, Great Britain and internationally. I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit greatly from his name as a government", says Beattie.
Doyle says, "I look forward to my role as a helo of athletes, and I hope that I can be useful and help guide Scottish sports in the right direction."
Another American athlete who won the Olympic Gold Award, who won 200 metres and 400 metres of trips to the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and who is now the permanent reaction of the BBC, lost its vitality as a result of passing blood circulation in the brain.
He said, "A month ago, I had a stroke."
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctor, only time will show, recovery and what will be done.
This has been exhausting work, but I've recovered completely, I've come to sleep again, and now I'm already training agileness!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Mothers cow-like ads share opinions online.
The breast pumping company's breast-feeding mothers’ dairy-like ad has shared opinions on the Internet.
Elvie, who prepares the technology for safety, has brought on the market a product called "the world's first breast pump that wears a voiceless and dressed face". Its marketing is stimulated by a promotion made in the cheek and tailored to music videos, which describes the freedom of the new pump to breast-feed mothers who are born to the freedom of the new pump.
The true mother of real life danced in a smile filled with grasses, among other things, with the words: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I can't see her" and "If you didn't see her, they're not hurries, they're tits."
He says, "Put it out, pump it out, feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, pump it out, milk my leides."
However, the advertisement published on the company's website produced a discussion online.
The video that collected 77 000 views and hundreds of comments has caused a conflicting reaction in viewers. Many people say it is ruining the daily ‘horror’ of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They must become pregnant and give birth so that they can produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them shortly after delivery", one commentary writes.

Another viewer commented: "Certainly, it is traumatic for both the father and the baby.
But why can't they be used to promote a pulsation pump for mothers who are allowed to have their baby?"
The second commentator added: "A complete commercial with a reality obligation."
Advertising also gave me defenders: one woman said that she thought the announcement was "crazy".
"I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one if I was still breast-feeding.
The pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a bit crazy, but I took it the way it is.
This is a brilliant product", reads together from comments.
Another viewer commented: "This is a funny ad directed at mothers who pump (mostly at work or in bathrooms) and "feel themselves cows".
Advertising is not intended to praise or condemn the dairy industry".
At the end of the advertisement, the women in the video reveal that they have danced unnoticed pumps into their bras in a stunned way.
The concept of advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women using breast pumps feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires and hoses, and it fits into the breast-feeding vests, which gives women the freedom to move, hold the baby and even go out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of the Mother Advertising Office commented: "Elve pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a brave and provocative entry into the market.
By breast-feeding mothers and dairy cows we wanted to bring all the challenges of breast- pumping into the light beam, we brought in an incredible sense of belief brought into the new pump in a entertaining and identical way."
The Elvie pump has reached its peaks before.

Hundreds of immigrants transferred to a tent camp at the border of the country to which they live, in all silence, to the tent camp at the border of the country.
Even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, the number of interested immigrants has increased sharply, even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, due to the fact that, as a result of the difficulties in the rhetoric and policy of the carcases introduced by the Trump administration, the placement of children in the families of the family has become more difficult.
Most foster families are traditionally composed of undocumented immigrants, and registration as a foster family may jeopardise their stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when the Federal authorities announced that potential foster families and other economic adults must give their fingerprints and that this information will be shared with the entry authorities.
Matthew Albence, a high-level entry and customs authority, proved last week in the UK that the Agency arrested ten people who had applied for a place of origin for minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested did not have an existing police record.
"Its 80% of people who are either members of the family or members of their households are illegally in the country, and most of them are criminal foreigners.
So let's keep looking for these people," says Albence.
In order to deal with the cases of children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that, in some cases, the case must be dealt with before the court within one month of the date of arrest, instead of the 60-day time limit previously used, the staff of the host centre will be heard by the staff of the host centre.
Many people will be present through videoconferencing as they personally drive their case to the court of origin for migrants.
Those who are not considered to be entitled to help will be deported as soon as possible.
According to reports published in recent months by staff at reception centres and the system, the time spent by children in prison affects whether children are beginning to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent protests or attempts to escape.
According to the lawyers, the concern is particularly raised in larger installations, such as Tornillo, where the child’s fortune can be ignored due to the size of the facility.
They increase that the transfer of children to tent cities without giving them sufficient time to prepare for it emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can cause a trauma, and that many children are suffering from traumas even now.
Syria commands the U.S., France and Turkey's "emergency troops" to leave immediately.
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even if the country has been fighting for eight years.
Moulem, who also acts as the prime minister, said that foreign troops are in the country illegally using the excuse for the fight against terrorism, and that "they will act accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moulem claimed "The war against terrorism was almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died in 2011 and since, and where many people have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "sacred battle until the whole of Syria has been cleared" of both organizations and "unlawful foreign troops".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding Kurds and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has invested in fighting to tear up more than 1 000 soldiers' divisions in the country.
On the issue of refugees, Moulem said that the conditions were good for coming back and accused "some Westerns" of the spread of "irradial fears" that encourage refugees to stay away from the country.
"We have invited the international community and the emergency agencies to facilitate these returns," he said.
"They were politics on a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be granted a re-re-construction before the end of the war has been agreed by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last base of the rebels in Idlib has created the opportunity to conduct political discussions.
The agreement between Turkey and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by the Syrian forces, supported by Russia, on the territory of which three million people live.
However, Moulem has stressed that the Agreement has "clear time limits" and expressed the wish that such action would be carried out by jihadists, including al-Qaida-related al-Nusra front fighters, who will be destroyed.
The United Nations Ambassador, Staffa de Mistura, hopes that it will soon be possible to call together the first meetings of the new government and opposition members of the Committee for the establishment and establishment of the post-war Syrian Constitution for elections.
Moulem set the terms for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, meaning that its work should be limited to "the revision of the provisions of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.

From the outside flow money to a perfectly intermediate-stamping game.
It is not surprising that the 17th elections in Pennsylvania have encountered real cash flow, as due to the reorganization of the congressional districts, two already elected candidates will have to fight for one place.
This recently re-elected Electoral District of Pittsburgh is a battle challenge for the Democrat Conor Lamb, who became the source of another constituency in last spring's special elections.
Lamb will compete with another selected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing the old 12th round of the Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th round of elections.
The regional division was redeployed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old electoral division would favour Republicans contrary to the Constitution.
Competition in the 17th Electoral Commission (CC) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (NRCC) have launched an economic struggle in the financial departments of the main parties in the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (CC).
The name of Lamb became familiar in Pennsylvania, largely followed by special elections in the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The place had been in the Republic for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won the area in the 20th century.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a great advantage.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew its intentions.
Diplomatics have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already quoted the situation in Beijing and the mild counter-reaction in Washington.
President Trumpi had a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Varela, in June 2017, and he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners banished the Trump Organization Group's leading team.
The US Department of Foreign Affairs officials decided to invite the US Presidents of the diplomats back from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "on the basis of laudable guidelines that no longer recognise Taiwan", noted the Directorate-General Heather Nauert in his opinion earlier this month.
However, the punishments were considered only for El Salvador, which received an estimated USD 140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely hit the Central American State with high unemployment and mental crime rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central America's authorities postponed a high-level meeting on security and economic prosperity. Last year's meeting was seen as a step in companies to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
However, in the middle of September, high administrative officials made it clear that the meeting wanted to progress and this effectively decided on speculation of possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now expected to give some indication to the meeting in mid-October of the importance of the administration of the meeting, the diplomats stated.
The three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new bad messages or penalties from Washington.
The officer of the Bolton White House refused to comment on the details of the discussion with three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs with an anonymous request.
Their report was strengthened by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke in the protection of an anonymity condition.
History teaches.
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Lawyer Robert Mueller on the possible prevention of justice by President Trump, who is now very serious in public documents.
Mueller has also been reported to conduct a indicative investigation into whether the Trump campaign was secretly working in cooperation with Russia when Russia intervened in the US elections.
If power changes in the House, President Trump will notice that he is accountable to it just as he prepares to go back to his constituents and may be condemned to his equals.
There are a lot of interlocutions here, and I don't mean that President Trump's loss would be inevitable - no more than the loss of such people in Europe.

The process of history is reversed by such factors, where the inevitable transition of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of these points.
What if President Trump fires Deputy Minister Rod Rosenstein, who is responsible for the investigation of the Mueller case?
Mr. Rosenstein has been hibernated since the information became public that he had proposed a secret record of the President's speech and considered the President's ability to perform his duties incapacity.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' report is invalid.
"How do we react if the newly required FBI investigation by Brett Kavanugh is not complete or fair in its operation or if he is confirmed to be a member of the Supreme Court despite the credible alleged sexual harassment and dishonest testimony made?

If we fail in these cots, our democracy will be long and dark in winter.

Rangers' Graham Dorans as optimistic as the Rapid Wien meeting.
The Rangers will meet at home on Thursday, knowing that in the same month in Spain, after the game against Villarreal, the Austrians would be the winner of the Austrians would give the team a strong position to get to the European League G block.
The worst injury was prevented by middle-field player Graham Dorrans from entering the field this season before the Furrreal 2-2 game, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a stepping-up platform for better results.
"That was a good result for us, because the Alexander is a good answer," says 31-year-old player.
"We went to the game with the expectation that we could get something and bring a point with us.
We might have been able to catch the win at the end, but overall the game is probably a fair result.
I guess they were better in the first half, and we got on one side and we were better.
Once again, on Thursday, an important night in the European League is coming up.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because their results were good at the previous game, but I believe that with the support of this team, we can do everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really hard on what comes into my own injury and changes in the team, but now the situation feels good.
The assembly is good and the boys enjoy it; the training is doing well.

The fear of pension savings takes women nights from nights to nights.
Although the participants had a clear view of how they wished to take care of themselves, only a few had talked to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the nationwide study reported discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 per cent of respondents said they had spoken to their children about it.
"The people want the family to take care of them, but do not discuss them," says Holly Snyder, Vice-President of the National Life Insurance Company.
Here's the start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you cannot prepare your family to take care of you unless you tell your wishes in time.
Discuss with a professional person and your family on where and how to get help, since these issues are an important cost-setting factor.
Consult the economics in the debate: advice can also help you to find a way to cover these costs.
Long-term financing options may include, for example, traditional long-term long-term insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs, or self-employed insurance, if you have a reservation.
Load legal documents: prevent legal disputes.
Get a medical representative so that you can appoint a person of trust to monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also drawing up a kingdom for your economic affairs.
It allows you to determine the person you created to take care of your financial decisions and to ensure that your invoices are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Remember also the small details: imagine that your elderly parent would be on his way to the hospital due to a medical emergency.

He was shot several times in Ilfracombe with an air rifle.
A man was shot several times with an air gun while he was walking home late last night.
The victim of about 40 years of age was Ilfracomben in the Oxford Grove area of Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.

In Indonesia, earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 3 April people have been killed in a violent earthquake and tsunamis that hit the town of Keres in Indonesia on Friday. According to the authorities, the number of victims is expected to increase.
Since communications in the area are broken, the rescuers have not received any information from the north of the district of Donggala, which is closer to the centre of gravity of 7.5 magnets.
More than 16 000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Key information about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawes province, located in the west coast of the island of Sulawes, a narrow bay, with a population of approximately 379 800 in 2017 and a population of approximately 379 800 in 2017.
The earthquake and the tsunami struck the middle of the city's 40th anniversary party.
The municipality of Dongalala extends more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) to the north-west coast of the island of Sulawes.
The municipality of Donggala is a province administrative area with a population of approximately 299 200 in 2017.
The main economic sectors of the Central Sulawes province and, in particular, the coastal economy in the Donggal sector are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel extraction is also important, but it is concentrated on Morowal on the opposite coast of Sulawes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
In 1938 the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit nine people killed in 1996 in the western part of Donggala.
Indonesia is situated in an active Pacific Ring of Fire area and often suffered earthquakes.
Some of the most serious earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in North Sumatra along the western coast of the Indonesian Aceh province, on December 26, a tsunami struck 14 countries and killed 22,000 people on the coasts of the Indian Ocean, over half of the victims in the Aceh region.
2005: The series of severe earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and at the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias by the coasts of Sumatra.
2006: 6.8 Magnitude quake struck south of the most inhabited island in Indonesia, Java, causing a tsunami that hit the island's southern coast by killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 7.6 Magnificent quake struck the city of Padang, the capital of the West Sumatra province.

The federal prosecutors are asking for the extraordinarily death penalty to be imposed on a suspect in the NYC terrorist attack.
The federal prosecutors in New York are seeking death penalty in Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack on eight lives in New York City, which is a punishment that has not been enforced in the state since the federal crime in 1953.
According to the charge, Saipov, 30, used Home Depot's rental car in a October attack on the driveway of West Side Highway, in the south of Manhattan, where he was driving on pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a report on the application of the death penalty in the New York State Region, it is possible that the prosecutors will be able to prove that Saipov killed eight victims "intendedly" and caused "intended" serious physical injuries.
According to the case-law, it is possible to impose a death sentence on both charges.
Weeks after the attack, the federal law has charged Saipov with 22-person charges including charges for eight murders to assist a terrorist organisation. Federal prosecutors typically use this criminal code in cases related to organised crime. In addition, the charges include charges for the violence and the destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "serious planning and preparation", the prosecutors identified and described the way in which Saopov did what he did "serious, cruel and shameful."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov suffers injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelin, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadtin, Darren Draken, Ariel Erlijin, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", reports the prosecution.
Five of the victims were arctic tourists.
The past decade has passed since the law of the Southern State Region of New York has given birth to death.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murders of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty has been last enforced in New York in the New York Federal Republic case in 1953, when husband Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to two years earlier for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the cold war.
Both of them were executed in electric chairs on 19 June 1953.
According to the laws of law, Saipov, a citizen of Uzzi, did not show any signs of repentance during the days and months following the attack.
He told the researchers what he did was good, the police told them.
According to the charge, Saipov told the authorities that he had received an inspiration after watching ISIS video on his phone.
I said that Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket to his hospital room.
He charged 22-to- 22-to-one accusations of innocence.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saipói, said that the defence was "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutor.
"We believe that the decision to require the death penalty and not recognition and life-long air release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma of the parties involved in these events", Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked that he not be required to be punished for death.
The Conservative Representative says that Nigel FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Mr. Nigel Farage promised today in a demonstration against the Conservatives "to mobilize the civilian army."
Former Ukip Director said that politicians must be aware of the pressure of the Eurosceptics - when one of the own parliamentary representatives of Theresa May proposed to lead negotiations with the EU.
Commissioner Peter Bone of the Conservatives said that in Birmingham the United Kingdom would already be "out" if Farage was a Brexite secretary.
But May will face up to the challenge of remaining conservatives associated with a separate demonstration against Brexite in the city, in the context of the negotiation of a challenge that will be undermined by the conservatives in favour of May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his proposal for a 'Dequerrs' in line with the pressure of the Brexite supporters and opponents, as well as of the EU.
Beneficiaries call on him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Bangkok despite the setback and to force the Eurosceptics and the working party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leive Means Leave event in Solihull, he would like to "switch the Chequers proposal to go.
He suggested that Farage should be involved and that he should be responsible for the negotiations with Bangkok.
"If he had been in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Mr Wellingborough's representative added: "I am defending the Brexite, but we need to get rid of Chequers' proposal."
He put forward his opposition to the EU, stating: "We did not make World Wars subject to our heads.
To legislate our own laws in our own country."
Bone was shocked by the idea that the public opinion would have changed after the 2016 vote: "The fact that the British had changed their minds and wanted to remain is a completely incorrect statement."
The conservative Brexite supporter Andrea Jenkyns also participated in the march and said to journalists: "I only say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, nor will it be supported by the members of the party or by the activists who really go out on the streets and are responsible for our success in general.
Cancel the Chequers proposal and start listening."
In a message addressed to May, he added: "The Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said that politicians must feel pressure if they intend to reverse the 2016 referendum decision.
This is about trust between the people and the political class", he said.
"They're trying to water Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it."
In talking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want politicians who are about to roll the Brexite to feel pressure from you."
"We are going to mobilise this country's civil army, which gave us victory in the Brexit vote, and we will not rest until the United Kingdom is an independent, self-governanced and proud state again."
In the meantime, the supporters of the interim stay marched across Birmingham before the two-hour event to be held in the city center.
A small number of activists were swinging "Tories Agiss Brexit" signs. The group was established this weekend.
The working party Lord Adonis mocked the conservative security problems they had with the party app at the beginning of the meeting.
"These are the people who claim to be able to get IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, and the smooth frontiers for trade in Ireland free," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no good brexit", he added.

Russia's Grand Prix: ? Hamilton approaches the world's media after team arrangements offer him victory over the Sebastian Vest.
Kunteri Bottas passed on the Saturday of Lewis Hamilton, it was evident that Mercedes’ team arrangements are an important part of the competition.
Bottas got a good start from the stake and left Hamilton almost his own luck behind in defending him for his first two rounds, calling on Vetti to attack his teammates.
Vettel went to the stable first and left Hamilton driving a bunch of winds that should have solved the situation.
Mercedes went to the shelter a few days later and returned to Vettle, but Hamilton passed after a little contact with the Ferrari driver, who was willing to move from the interior line to his defence after two more translations of his investment.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the past and was the seventh after the first round.
After that, he was leading a large part of the competition while extending the exchange of tyres as he aimed at quick completion and the fourth-place export from Kimi Räikkös.
In the end, he came to the shadow in the 44th round, but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight rounds while Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and being a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has made an extraordinary project to achieve double victory", Hamilton said.
Bad bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that he did not leak to the public a letter from Mr Blasy Ford, in which he accused the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
On this occasion, in West Virginia, the President did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Ombudsman's committee, but stated that what was happening in the Senate was a demonstration of the people's 'ilath, evil and dishonesty'.
"The one possible thing, the wonderful thing that has been going on in the Senate for the last few days, when we see anger, people who are angry, evil, evil and dishonest," said the President.
"When we see publications and bedtime stuff, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.'
Do you understand?
Halehne Feinstein, are you the data for this year?
Do you remember his answer...years of the document - ‘ oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't bleed.'
Now, now.
Our day... no, we didn't leak", he added to the senator by saying so.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the charges against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked to the public in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak would have occurred in his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's accusations, and I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential in accordance with his wishes."
But his refusal was not good enough for the president who commented on this issue on Saturday's occasion: "I wish you all that that was very poor for the language of the body.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst thing I've ever seen in my body language."
The President continued to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused of sexual harassment by three women and thought that the Democrats would use charges for their own benefit.
"They have chosen to regain power by any means possible.
They don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to gain power and control," Media reports the President.

The airline requested an attempt to find a man in cooperation with local authorities, hospitals and accident researchers.
The airline did not answer the questions about additional information on lost passengers such as age or nationality.

The analyst presents a timeline for the night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the D.A.'s office completed a reprocessing of the man accused of a Mississippi female female female in 2014 of being a live woman.
Paul Rowlet, an analyst at the Ministry of Justice of the United States of America, witnessed for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he had used the information stored on his cell phone when he collected one of the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinto Tellis and 19-year-old victims of the victim’s Roman Chambers on the night of the victim’s death.
Rowlet told me that he had received the location of several mobile phones which, on the contrary, demonstrated his previous claims with Chambers on the night that he died, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the information showed that Telis' cell phone was at Chambers's at the same time that Telllis was expecting to be with his friend Michael York, the police questioned Sanford.
Turns out, on Saturday, he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in the Sanford car that night, he replied that Tellis "is lying because my car was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis thought he knew Chambers about two weeks after he died.
According to the data recorded in the mobile phone, they had known each other only for a week.
Rowlet stated that at some point after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from her address.

Another dark one?
A New York nurse is suing the couple for racist texting.
A New York nurse challenges a couple's disqualification after accidentally obtaining a child's mother's text message, where she complains that she's "only one dark woman".
The state disputes its position as racists and compares the challenge to "the public."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed his pity when the new nanny Gisse Maurice came to work on his first day of work in 2016 and he became aware that this was dark-skinned.
"EIIII, I've never heard of it again," Plasco-Flaxman wrote again in a text message.
Then he sent a message instead of his husband to Gisse Maurice, twice.
Plasco-Flaxman, who realized that his mistake had been made, had, according to the New York Post, made a distinction between Maurice and their previous departures, stating that their Afro-American nurse had done her job badly, and this time she had been waiting for the Philippines to do her job.
Maurice received a payment from one of his working days and was sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for the right to an allowance and wants to pay USD 350 per day for a six-month period, for which she was originally debauched to live and work in the family, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that they can't do that," he said to the Post on Friday and added, "I know it's discriminatory."
The couple have responded to racist claims that the termination of Maurice's employment was a valid decision because they could not trust him after he was offended.
"My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racists", Joel Plasco told us at the Post interview.
"But would you leave your child to the person you've been unfriendly, even if by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco was in contrast to the challenge of blackmail and I said that his wife had had had a baby two months earlier and was "in a very difficult situation".
"Should another be hunted in such a situation?
It's not very well done", the investment banker added.
While the trial is still under way, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple’s social media with their conduct and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not identify themselves with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, says in the letter: "It is hard to live up to the position of a person who read the book for the first time before publication.
It's fun now that Paddington's huge popularity is known."
In saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before his dedication to writing books about toy-car trades, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books seemed bitter because his father died last year.
She described Paddington as "a very important family member" and said that she was proud of the success it had achieved.
"He was a pretty quiet man, not a flat-out guy at all," she says.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like the child's achievement to him; the one you're proud of, even though it's not really your own achievement.
I think he experienced the success of Paddington that way.
Even though it was about his creation, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
His mother had been praised for landing at the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, Nice, where doctors were trying to save his life in vain.
"They really mattered and told me that it was really bad that he didn't expect to make it," Ednan-Laperous says.
Then they called and said that my daughter will die in a few minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her in a talk.
I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be right with you.
I'll be with you."
The drugs that the doctors used to keep his heart running phased out of his body.
He was dead a little earlier, and now everything passed out.
I might just sit there and know that everything is over.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together."
Finally, Ednan-Laperous, who mourned the loss of his death, launched a plane among other people who knew nothing about the experience he was currently going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I kept my head down and the tears poured all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a great deal of sympathy for Nad.
That he now needed my love and understanding.
Know how much he loved my daughter."
Sad women send cards to prevent suicide on a bridge.
Two women who have lost their loved ones work to prevent other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and (2013) Humphreys are sending cards with encouraging messages and a telephone number that can be supported.
Davis' son, who was 13 years old, fell into depression and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
"I don't want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day," he said.
Davis, 45 of Lydney, reports that his son was a promising cook with an infectious grin.
"He was known for being crazy.
They all said that his head would illuminate the whole room."
After all, he finished his job before he died because he felt "in darkness".
In 2014, an 11-year-old brother named Tyler died from a brother who had taken his own life away from him.
She fears that she is constantly afraid of the side effects.
Davis creates cards "for telling people that there are people who can go to talk, even if it is a friend.
Do not remain silent - you must speak."
Humphrey has been a friend of Davies for many years, and he lost his partner Mark 15 years after he had been together, shortly after his mother had died.
"He didn't say whether he was down or depressed or anything like that," Humphreys said.
"A change of day before Christmas we passed a change in his behavior.
He was right there on the day of Christmas, and when the children opened their gifts, he took no eye contact with them or anything like that."
He notes that Mark's death was a serious trauma to them, but they still have to survive: "It's gonna blow the family apart.
It will tear us apart.
But all we have to do is live our lives and fight forward."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake at the time of the start of its investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually achieve what he hoped for - a limited investigation in time and in scope - we could achieve some coherence", Flake said on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "disperse" the deadlock caused by the supporters.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
The future is about timing.
The interim elections are only five weeks away on 6 November, and if Republican success is weak as expected, their efforts to get the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court of the country will be sued.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called the senators to allow them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and met his wife, Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary, through him.
What will happen after the report on the FBI has been prepared?
A vote will take place on the day of the present sitting of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes, so Vice-President Mike Pence could blow the game off and confirm his choice to the highest level.
The number of North korea figures will fall during Kim's time during Kim's time, during which the number of North korea's figures will fall.
According to the cross-border legislator, the number of persons who have broken down from North Korea has decreased since the seven years since the entry into force of Kim Jong-un.
Byeong-Seug quoted the Ministry of Integration of South Korea and told them that the cuts took place last year in 1 127 - in 2011 they took place in 2,706.
According to Park, key factors have been the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as increases in the prices of human traffickers.
There is no comment on the subject publicly.
In the end, most North Korean cutters will be offered the citizenship of South Korea.
It says from Seoul that more than 30 000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean war ended in 1953.
They are searching through China because it has the longest border with North Korea and it is easier than a highly protected demilitarised zone between the Kores.
China treats the locusts as illegal immigrants and not as refugees and most often returns them by force.
Even technically, the North Korea-South relations at war have improved significantly in recent months.
In the past month, the leaders of countries met in Pyongyang, and the discussions focused on the negotiations that were held on hold at the end of the nuclear war.
This followed the historic meeting of June at which President Donald Trump and Kim Jong of the United States met in Singapore and agreed, at a general level, on an objective towards a nuclear weapon in the country of Korea.
On Saturday, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the North Korea Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for the impunity of sanctions after the meeting.
"Without any confidence from the United States, our national security is not on a reliable basis, and under such circumstances, we will by no means begin to break down unilaterally as the first to our equipment," Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Playfully invited Brett Kavanaugh to be "hysterical" and inappropriate to act in the highest court.
Vice-President Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that this was temporarily inappropriate to act in the Supreme Court.
You were afraid to comment on this during a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I could not help but imagine that if she had acted like this, she would be called "hysterical", "fear said of her own opposition to the Kavanaugh testimony before the Ombudsman's committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was very passionately denying the accusations that he would have been sexually assaulted by Mr. Blasy Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was in his emotions, and sometimes he nearly cried out and lost his say when he told his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the accusations against himself by the democratic members of the committee, without calling it "the persecution of the grotesque and the intended person", which have been organized by the Liberals who were angry at Hillary Clinton's election in 2016.
Your fear said that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that this was not capable of acting in the Supreme Court because it indicated that he was partial to the Democrats.
"I believe that he made himself unqualified with his opinions and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
You were worried when you were asked if he would press charges against Kavanaugh if this choice were confirmed and if the Democrats were to have a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's say - if he doesn't tell the U.S. or the FBI, he's not valid except for the Supreme Court, and also for the law in which he currently works," said Fear.
Kavanaugh is currently working for the U.S. Federal Court of Appeal.
Your fear added that, as a demon, he was concerned about any information that Kavanaugh might have had in relation to the health reform or Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known as a conservative lawyer.
In the consultations on his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not an appropriate time for a hysterical and partial person to be chosen as a member of the law and we would expect it to be a great one," said Fear.
Women need to survive everything.
It's a legitimate fire speech over the rage of months and years, and she won't be able to cry without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Miss Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's in any way unusual, do you think?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a position where she was going to be somewhere, and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a way to speak to her husband in a situation where she was angry and started to cry," you might think I was sad now because I was crying.
Really, I'm the wrong person."
And then he just went on and on and on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
The pens are justified by reason of the rage as a landing route, even though they are generally misguided in a basic sense.
One of my most memorable memories of my early work in a man's office is when I cried out of my rage and the older woman - the cold-hearted supervisor I had always been a little scared - grabbed me off my neck and pulled me down the stairs.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you're sad and then they're happy because they feel sorry for you."
At the time, Ms.>>eng<< Schiroeder, a Democrat Representative from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in this presidential campaign.
While Hart was caught in 1987 in a relationship with a boat called "Monkey Business" and got out of the race, he was very upset with the Schroeder feel that there was no reason why he wouldn't try to be president himself.
"It wasn't a very well thought-out decision," he said to me 30 years later.
"There were seven of these already, and at least one more was needed.
Someone called the situation "the snows and the two dwarfs."
Since the campaign period was long gone, he was behind the fundraiser, and so he said he wouldn't go to the race if he didn't get $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave a thousand dollars to male candidates, only gave him 250.
"Do they think I'm getting some discount?" he was thinking.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not engage in an official campaign, he would take over his feelings of gratitude for his supporters, a system of frustration that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and not for the election of delegations, and the sex of hatred - that he could not speak.
"You could have thought I was getting a nervous breakdown," Mr. Schiroeder recalls the press's reactions.
"You could have thought that Kleenex was a sponsor.
I remember that my gravestone will probably be beaten up for a copy of the document.
'He cried.''
How can the US and China trade war benefit Beijing?
The departure for the US and China trade war was ear-driving and although the battle is more than just past, country's trade break may benefit Beijing in the long term, experts will note.
President Donald Trump of the United States of America gave the first warning earlier this year by imposing import duties on the main Chinese export items with solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new customs duties affecting imported goods for USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion), taxing effectively half of all imports from China to the United States of America.
Beijing has replied at the same level each time, between five and ten per cent of customs duties charged to US imported goods worth USD 60 billion.
China has promised to respond to the United States with an eye - style, and it does not seem that the second largest economic power in the world would be in decline for a moment.
In order to get Washington to retreat, we should give up on our own demands, but the U.S. press’s bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for President Xi Jinping of the PRC.
However, experts point out that if Beijing is playing its cards correctly, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing country-to-country dependency.
"A long-term political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, can create the conditions that start the economic cycle in either country and this is in fact a more dangerous possibility than the bystanders have understood so far", says Abigail Grace, a research assistant who has been familiar with Asia at the Center for New America Security think tank.
According to the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, the country is "prepared" for the return of refugees.
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and to ask for assistance in the reconstruction of the country after the devastating war of over seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said that the conditions on the ground would improve.
"Your business is now stronger and safer because of developments in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government will continue to repair areas of terrorist destruction in order to bring about a normal situation.
The circumstances now allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country from which they were forced to leave because of unilateral economic activities relating to terrorism and their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to the UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since war began in 2011.
Six million people still needing humanitarian aid are still in the country.
Al-Moulem noted that the Syrian Government would be a tool to help rebuild the land that was destroyed.
However, he stressed that the government would not accept any aid or assistance from countries that support the rebels.
The European team strengthened the victory of Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team at the finish points of 16,5 against 10.5 Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has now disappeared six times in a row in Europe, which has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team held on to it when its Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached 11.5 points, which was needed to win the United States of America.
The U.S. star player Phil Mickelson had difficulty in almost the entire tournament, and he hit his start on the par=rail 16 path, giving a match for Francesco Molinar.
The Italian Molinari was bright on all the rounds and became one of the four players that has resulted from 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in its current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth in the United States of America was released with the result of 5-4 European team of the lowest-ranking player against the Danish Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the world’s top player, was defeated by the result of 2 and 1 of the Ian Poulter, who could now play his last Ryder Cup.
The eight Ryder Cups’ golf steels, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the most profitable tournament ever in the world by a total of 25,5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a long time.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to win this victory.
It is a team, and I am glad that I could help you", said moved Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He will transfer the conversion to his landman Jon Rahim, who won the United States' golf course Tiger Woods in 2 to 1 in the individual competitions played on Sundays 2 to 1.
"I feel so proud of winning Tiger Woods, I grew to admire him," said Rahm, 23 years old.
Woods lost all four of his meetings in France and now has the Ryder Cup record 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the best players of all time who have won 14 great profits and, secondly, remain only for Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had difficulty finding the routes throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, whose game was high-level throughout the tournament.
The U.S. team leader Jim Furyk said after a failed demonstration: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We put emphasis on the European team in the game this morning.
We fucked up.
Thank you very much.
He's great. He's great.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, work with our European PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move on.
These 12 guys are great and I'm proud to be their guy.
I gotta get a hat.
We met our winner."
