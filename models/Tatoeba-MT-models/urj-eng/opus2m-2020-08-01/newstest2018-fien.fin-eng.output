Camille Auer wanted to change her sex, was diagnosed as a mental illness, and now she's doing an art on the subject - "Man should have the right to his own body".
There are ten patient reports coming from the roof of the Project Room Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts.
Each one contains the name of Camille Aurer.
The papers explain the annual story of how outside people have made their interpretation of Auer and this spirit.
You decided for him who he is.
"I wanted to tell you about the person's immediate management history in order to make the violence of the process visible," Auer says.
In the process, he refers to the gender correction process.
It is often a long-term investigation period, which includes meetings with psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and doctors.
The process will be started by sending a "sex-identity disorder" diagnosis study to be carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
In the case of Auer, the process started four years ago.
Even before this, he had been using estrogen on the Internet in his own country and was otherwise very far ahead of his own repair process.
She experienced a woman, but according to the law of Finland, a person has to go through a process of correction in order to be able to remedy the gender legally, too.
TransLaki, i.e. the law establishing the trans-salial sex (563/2002) obliges trans-gender people to engage in forced sterilization in order to get the right sex, for example, to the Population Register Centre and passport.
At present, any authority in Poland is calling for a psychiatric diagnosis and evidence of incontinence.
A person has the right to decide on his own body.
"This situation is insufferable and causing human rights," says Auer.
The reform of the Transact has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Council of Nations has issued eight observations and the European human beings before the Court of Justice has a preliminary ruling requiring the parties to the European Convention of Human Rights to exercise their right to exercise their right of independence.
The previous Finnish Government prepared an amendment to the law under the leadership of Susanne Huovinen, then Minister of Social Affairs and Health.
Fire elections and the Indigenous Finns rose to the government.
Now legal change is back in place.
It is a question of internal policy disputes which do not even relate to this law.
"The government does not want to raise it at the table because there is a disagreement within the government about changing the law," says Frank Johansson, Executive Director of the Department of Amnesty Finland.
The front of the exhibition space is dominated by two large installations.
One of them consists of the pack sizes and instructions for use of Auer.
In the patient report installation, any visitor can read, for example, the interpretation of the psychologist’s interpretation of the trapol at Tampere University Hospital in Auer.
A psychologist met Camille Auer twice and based on these, he wrote a report that would determine the treatment and assistance of Auer's justice.
The perception of the reality of the investigation appears to be vulnerable to a loss of consciousness.
The surveyer's perception of himself appears to be at the border level in a way that is scattered and the unstable features of the universe are highlighted.
Auer did not recognize himself in these descriptions.
"It was a shock to hear that I was diagnosed as a mental illness," Auer says.
There was an even greater shock when Auer was not granted treatment for the correction of the diabetes.
According to the medical staff, his resources were not sufficient to start the process.
He was denied his own identity.
On February 11th, 2015 Auer walked out of the meeting and kicked off the transpol waiting for the message.
Later that television was created by an art work called Origin for the Exclusive, where Auer refleted his experience of power and conduct.
"It's crazy that any person identified as a woman in the birth can magnify his chest, but to remove the breasts requires a diagnosis," Auer says.
Your body is not yours if you feel that you are different from your natural sex.
Unfortunately, the experience of the auer is not the only kind.
For many, the sexual correction process is more important for spiritual reasons than purely medical operations.
Its passersby meet with dozens of people who have to justify their own existence and their right to their own sexual experience.
"It is crazy that people who are in need of support and assistance are denied treatment, claiming that their resources are not enough," Auer says.
Those who have experienced many processes have a psychological effect: depression, anxiety, possible harassment experiences.
On these grounds, the healthcare staff may order that treatment not be initiated.
"To prevent treatment and assistance can cause man to become even worse than before the process started," Auer says.
Auer's personal exhibition also addresses anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
In the exhibition release Auer writes: "I've had suicidal thoughts all my life, and that's what people usually find it hard to melt."
Depression has been treated with medicines and when Auer started using hormones, it made it easier to feel better.
He had been able to fully understand the feelings that existed already in the public and in the teen age.
Why the wide jaw did not seem suitable for its own body and why the breast muscle should have been round instead of a flat chest.
The most important thing to Auer has been that there are people around him who can see him.
It is essential to have a view of the matter.
"The person must justify so much by speaking, acting, using sound and moving," he says.
Today, Auer is experiencing a future sight, she is a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, close random comments may have hurt a lot.
Most of all, it hurts when close apostates are involved.
"They should know who I am, and they know who I am, but they will not or will not be able to integrate it," he continues.
However, not all transiters need physical changes.
They do not suffer from body dysphoria, or body conflict, in which the body or parts of it can cause anxiety and even physical pain.
However, the use of hormones and the long research process cannot be formally confirmed to one’s own family.
"There is no medical basis for such research," Auer says.
And that's true.
In Denmark, in June 2014, Parliament adopted a new procedure for the recognition of legal sex.
The new legislation is based on the right of autonomy in relation to legal sex.
A full-lived applicant shall make a written application for a new identity card, stating that he or she is experiencing a second party.
After six months of consideration, the applicant confirms his application in writing and the Ministry will provide the applicant with a new identity card.
This right of autonomy is also required for Finland and the Auer exhibition is also crystallized in this requirement.
It has not been a therapeutic experience for the artist; the exhibition is a political and artistic collection of works.
I believe that art is still important and that it can bring about false changes at a time when politicians have forgotten human rights.

The Civil Society Organisation has issued a travel alert to Missouri.
The Afro-American Civil Rights Organisation (NAACP) has issued a travel warning for Missouri, which is the result of discriminatory practices and racist attacks by the state.
"The travel information of the ACP on Missouri will enter into force on 28 August 2017 and it calls on African-American tourists, visitors and locals to pay particular attention and to take the utmost caution when travelling in a state in which numerous questions have recently occurred on the basis of race", states the Organization's press release.
According to the NAACP, these factors led to the issuing of a travel warning.
"Civil rights of people are violated.
They will be stopped on the basis of color and be assaulted or killed", said Rod Chapel, President of the NAACP Missouri, to Kansas City Star.
"we have not heard from one of the two cases before in as short a period of time."
The Missouri travel note is the first U.S. warning issued by the organisation to the United States of America.
The organization referred to the death of 28-year-old black Tory Sanders, born in Missouri University and Tennessee, as examples of racist comments against African-American students.
Sanders died in serious circumstances last year, and he was driving through the state when his car ran out of fuel. Missouri police arrested him, even if he was not accused of a crime.
The travel note also referred to the report of the Minister of Justice of Missouri that the police are likely to stop 75 % of the black driver by the police rather than the white driver.
"The purpose of the travel information notice is to encourage people to be alert and to warn their families, friends and colleagues about what can happen in Missouri," Chapel says.
"For example, people must prepare for money to pay guarantees or tell relatives that they intend to travel through the state."
According to the F.B.I., in 2015, hundreds of haters, the 16th largest U.S. states, were recorded in Missouri in 2015.
Travel warnings are also a response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult to challenge companies for discrimination in housing and employment.
The ACTU, which was guaranteed by the Constitution, recently issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws that you commit to arresting the police for immigration offences, which, according to the order of course, will increase racial-based profiling.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concern other countries. Recently, however, NGOs have published them in response to certain laws and developments in the United States.
Yle: Lintilä asked Finnair for additional retirement of the Executive Director of the Report.
Mika Lintilä, Minister of State Ownership, has asked Finnair for a report on the additional pension received by the CEO of the airline Pekka Varamo, Yle.
According to the Minister, it is in conflict with the will of the State.
The EUR 130 000 additional pension received by Vauram was raised this week when Helsingin Sanomat informed about the remuneration development of the directors of listed companies.
The newspaper Newspaper on Varamon's supplementary retirement in February.
Finnair said that he would give up further pensions in 2013.
The State has stated that no additional pensions will be used for remuneration.
The State owns more than half of Finnair.
According to the pilot, the decision is in line with the last year's ownership management principle.
The sanctions increased immediately the number of talks.
A while ago, it seemed that the relations between the United States and Russia were on their way to a cold run.
In the context of the G20 meeting in Hamburg, the United States President Donald Trump and the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, who met in the United States, seemed to be working well together.
More so, the atmosphere has cooled considerably.
The new economic sanctions adopted last week by the United States and adopted by the Trump on Wednesday were reacted in Russia with a bitter reaction to the new economic sanctions adopted by the United States.
The most shocking answer has so far been heard from Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev, who says that the sanctions law signed by Trump means "full trade war".
Even if the reaction would only be in the form of tensions and overcrowds of political rhetoric, it is a fact that the gap between the United States and Russia is tightening up after the short period following the selection of the Trump.
The transit through the sanctions for the United States, Iran and North Korea was not simple.
Although the Congress approved the law with a clear consensus, the adoption of the law to the President was, as has been said, much more difficult.
Trump therefore criticised the law of his country, which was recently signed, as "a significant deficit".
President Trump must have been responsible, in particular, for Russia, even though the adoption of a law restricting the rights of others must have been atrocious.
As well as being well known, investigations are being carried out in the United States of America on Russia's potential involvement in the presidential elections as well as on Russia's links to the Trump campaign.
The tightening between the United States and Russia is the real thing after the short rose season.
Once the White House staff has changed into a tight and the various scandalous translations have been revealed almost up to date, it appears that foreign policy in the United States, despite the President's leadership, is still more clearly apparent.
This situation is certainly not desirable.
If the Russian relationship is a blight in the United States, the same applies to the European Union as well.
In addition to economic sanctions, an exciting safety situation in the Union’s nuclear region in the Baltic Sea will strengthen relations in the Baltic Sea.
The EU has clearly presented the situation in Ukraine in its Russia relationship and called for the implementation of the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has so far remained at least one side of Russia's policy, the interests of the Member States are quite different.
For a country such as Finland, a country that trades a lot with Russia, economic sanctions have been a real problem.
The effects of the new US law on sanctions are still unclear.
In the EU, there are fears that sanctions will make it difficult for many European companies to operate.
In Finland, for example, impacts can be felt in Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project and possibly in the Fennovoima nuclear plant project.
Acidity in Europe has been caused by the exclusion of sanctions, for example, of the US economy's major liquid natural gas lng.
Trade sanctions are the way in which the world policy can show a show of gratification.
However, employment vaccines must be very well-advanced and precise.
Otherwise, they will easily be more harmful than useful.
Ain't nothing sacred anymore?
The most beautiful White House now has its destination in the White House of Freedom.
Absence in the fields is the most secure signal of a change of power.
The Americans know that as well as others: the Iraqis fell together with the American soldiers in the Firdo Square of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of the government of the Trump, knew well what he had done in an intense debate with CNN-channel Jim Acosta. The image of the Bible was the object of Miller's attack on the vocabulary on the President's proposal to significantly reduce legal immigration.
Miller didn't really criticise the statue himself.
If he had done so, he would have been attacked by huge herds of cruise organisers and characterizing figures from the Freedom statue.
The importance of the statue was his attack, and in particular that in 1903 the poem of Emma Lazarus was added to the statue’s footing — 17 years after the statue was completed.
This is what Miller said to Acosta: "I don't want to go into this more accurate history, but the Statue of Freedom is a symbol of the freedom of the whole American world.
The poem was later added and does not belong to the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller was not, by all means, wrong, but it is not just about history, as he himself said.
Essential are Lazarus's touching words, the only quality in which the state not only invites immigrants but "the poorest of the poor": "You tired, your por,/ Your Huddled masses yearning to break free,/ The wretched refuuse of your teaming couple."
The poem is now more modern than ever.
Miller did not practice literary criticism, and he made it clear that "the poorest of the poor" are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The dispute about the importance of the Freedom statue is part of a wider public and cultural dispute over the meaning of the United States of America.
Lazarus' friends campaigned after his death for the poem to be attached to the statue on their feet, and they knew well that what he did was strongly political.
The purpose of the statue was to express the relationship between French and American Republics with classical symbolism, the free womanly incarnation.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in his poem, the female character is no longer abstract, but has a voice.
And it gives itself a new name: a deported mother.
The movement of the poem into the image was an ingenious feminist coup d'état and a devastating attack on the American concept of nationality.
Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, and the right has long wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh – an oral speaker, which can now be considered a sign of Trump – claimed in 2010 that the Statue of Truth does not call anyone, but is an early pioneer of the neoconservatives, which takes the United States to the world covered by the darkness: "Lady Liberty stands out.
He is going to take the US to the rest of the world from the United States to the rest of the world.
The evening doesn't show the way to the United States."
Rarely, Limbaugh was partly right.
The meaning of the image of freedom depends entirely on the point of view.
Lazarus saw it as poor and exhausted but hopeful immigrants from the deck of the ship after a long and trying journey.
He saw it from the perspective of the people looking for protection and a better life.
His statue of freedom comforts by giving hope and welcome to him.
And that's what Miller and Trump don't want in any case.
Their fires do not show the way, but turn on the flames of hatred, their only source of power.
World Sports Championships 2017: Neil Black praise the Scottish members of the British national team of the United Kingdom.
Elidh Doyle remembers the time when only two Scots of the country team in Great Britain had reached the country team of Great Britain.
The President of the United Kingdom's Association of Public Sports, Neil Black, says that 16 Scots members of the World Championships Team are "a significant confirmation".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the World Competition for Public Sports in London on Friday.
According to Black, in Scotland " something special is happening", from which British public sports must learn to learn from.
"This is welcome, and we will continue to study it for as long as we understand what it is," says Black.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scottish Institute of Sports, and they thought it was related to the activities of the Institute.
On the other hand, the Scottish Association of Public Sports believes that it is linked to the operation of the Union,
And the British Association of Public Sports believes that it is based on their activities.
And the ordinary advertiser thinks that he must have something to do with it.
However, this is something wonderful, whatever it is."
A multi-stamp athlete competes seriously in London for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farah on a run of 5,000 metres. Elith Doyle was elected to be a national team leader.
"Elidh is too modest.
His speech was incredible," Black says.
"The athletes left the event proud of their achievements and strongly motivated, regardless of where they happen to live and practice.
Eilith said that there was a genuine feeling and passion for sports."
Eilith Doyle is a silver medalist at the National Championships, 400 metres in the run, and these are his fifth World Championships, and he thinks it's "unbelievably" that there are 16 Scots on the national team.
The last record was from seven years 19th and 2015.
The middle travel runner Laura Muir has been running five British and two European records over the year.
He competes in London at 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres.
Chris O'Hare runs 1 500 metres in London. It is also worth keeping an eye on him: he has an excellent season behind him, including profits in UK World Cups and Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers his first World Championship competition, when the only Scots of the national team on his side was Lee McConn.
The national team leader says that he is "seriously proud" of the fact that there are so many Scots involved, some of which are seriously competing for finals and medals.
"Access is an honor," Doyle says, "but more specifically, because members of the national team voted for the Captain".
"I am, of course, very proud of all the checks that entered the national team.
It shows how far we have reached.
They are a part of earned athletes who compete for prize-makers.
My President-in-Office?
I think it went well.
I focused on how lucky we are when we have our home games.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home general and the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to compete there and I know that the climate will be amazingly beautiful."
Preventing critics on Facebook: Do not stand up for public office unless you endure criticism.
Our mother's father knew what was wrong with publicity.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers soon began to criticise him for all possible domestic politics always for his political principles.
I'm sure it's a pain in the ass,
but he did not silence his critics.
"If the freedom of speech is removed, we may be led in a stupid and silent manner as sheep for slaughter", said in 1783.
That brings us to the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who should learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official website and prevented their authors from doing so.
The U.S. Civil Rights Union challenged Hogan's court earlier this week.
His staff considered the challenge unfounded, and the attitude was also minor online.
"What difference does it make? This is just Facebook", a lot of comments.
But the point is,
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is an amazingly popular Republican Governor of the Democratic State.
He has received the second best estimates of his activities among 50 governors.
Hogan is not a sensitive reaction to the hot one.
He has led the state firmly and adhered strictly to the principles.
He has also used Facebook as the main communication channel for his voters and published there a picture of his bald head at chemo.
That is why the prevention of people on the Governor's Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The Governor's page is a public and official forum managed by his staff with tax assets.
Mr. Hogan’s editor, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor’s actions in an interview with the Washington Post.
However, the labelling of commentators as trolls, fans or haters is too easy to solve.
The Washington Post interviewed users who were blocking Hogan on Facebook.
They proved to be ordinary people who wanted to talk to the leaders they chose, not trolls, but teachers, entrepreneurs and pastors, for example.
They told me that their comments were respectful, kind and relevant.
The reflector borrowed the Bible in comment; he wanted to appeal to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Advocate General Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland’s Bowie was not hostile but raised the issue of hate crime.
"I was just politely disappointed that Hogan had not been able to carry out hate crimes and other recent news", he wrote in Washington Post's comments.
"I also cannot accept that, when more people comment on the same subject, they are immediately considered to be some sort of organised assembly and are sidelined with a large group of people concerned."
The Governor's staff called comments "a centralised attack," and someone else might invite them to promote important matters.
Facebook time communication is easy to manage by preventing a critic or removing a critical comment.
In the past, we should have sent staff to gather and inquire newspapers with critical manuscripts, or arrested and silenced protestors.
However, it is actually the same thing, now just knowingly.
Hogan is not the first public office officer accused of chaining Facebook and other social media channels.
He has been court-martially sued by users who have been prevented by President Trump.
The subject was the subject of the first final final decision last week in Virginia.
According to the court-martial judge James C. Cacheris, the Government of the Province of Loudoun broke the first addition of the U.S. Constitution by refusing the voter on Facebook.
And the U.S. Civil Rights Alliance discussed the use of Twitter and Facebook by Kentucky's Republican Governor Matt Bevin.
This shouldn't be hard.
Cheap mail charges at Washington time had a similar effect to those on the internet today.
The number of newspapers quadrupled from 1776 to 1800, and anonymous writers mutilated Washington.
There were trolls at the time.
The names Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote in newspapers letters in which they appealed to Washington decisions.
The President's office received appeals against the Jay Agreement, i.e. the Cooperation, Trade and Maritime Agreement between the United States and Britain, which is reflected in documents collected by the Papers of George Washington network project.
However, he did not silence his critics.
Freedom of expression, freedom of vote and freedom of debate are the basic stones of our nation.
True leadership means accepting this fact.
The summer food of birds should be stopped immediately.
The samples have come from about half a dozen places, and also online notifications from one, three.
Most of them have come from South and South Finland, but then from Haapavere and Seinäjoki, specialist Marja Nagymursu from Evira.
Greens have died of a parasitic disease called tricomonose.
This is caused by scientific knowledge, called Trichomonas gallinae, of the original animal.
In the past, it has been known to strike doves, and especially doves.
However, in the 21st century, there was also a case of foot-and-mouth disease.
In 2009, a good start was made in 2009.
Then tricomonoses caused a major collapse in Finland’s green horticultural stock, after which the species’ stocks have recovered.
There have been sick green peacocks now, but at least not yet on a large scale, Juha Honkala, the Mayor of the University of Helsinki's Centre of Science (Luomus) says.
There is a fear that the previous outbreak of green beads will be repeated again unless something is done.
What needs to be done now is a very simple thing that can be done by everyone: stop the birds’ summer food immediately.
For more information, see the section later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes to benefit from a home field representation at the Renaissance Club.
The former European top player Ronan Raffferty hopes to benefit from the home field representation for the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open tournament is organised in Renaissance Club East-Lothian.
Last year's Northern Rafferty led the tournament in the neighbourhood of Archerfield Links before the last round but eventually lost to Paul Eales. Rafferty has enjoyed a new place and is the ambassador of the tournament on behalf of the founder and CEO of the club, Jerry Sarvad.
"I followed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and this event will bring it to its full glory", Rafferty says.
"The players see the field at its best, it's in great condition.
Jerry has done a good job with this place.
He's an enthusiastic Westman of the game, and he's proud of his success here.
The tournament is a special event for this field."
The English Eales defends the championship for the first time, although he has won the European tour and the European challenge tour in his 32-year career.
"This seems to be a very special occasion," says the player in Southport.
"I was not able to defend the victory of Extremadura Open because this year's tournament is not part of the tour.
It's wonderful to be back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year come back to me: the tournament victory was a great story for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a great time that we will always remember."
Gary Orr will return to the truth on his own account, and he will join us on the tour after 50 years earlier this year.
This is his first performance in Scotland since 2013 in Aberdeen Asset-Scottish Open tournament.
"Illustration in the country is always more important than usual," says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed, but you also feel extra pressure.
I have enjoyed playing again and played pretty hard.
I am happy with my party so far."
The Wednesday will be followed by Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty, the winner of the Ian Woosnam and the major tournament winners of the senios.
Two Scots participate in the tournament: Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The car parking costs five pounds if the car is only equipped with a driver and ten pounds if there are at least two people in the car.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK Agency.
In Säkylä, the potential indoor air problems of the camp were identified.
In the village of Pori's Pori's Pori's company's communion building has not yet found any indoor air problems, and the Pori's company was told on Thursday.
The IA study will continue to be carried out.
The reports began when the man who gave up his military service for health reasons thought that his health had diminished due to the bad indoor atmosphere of the desert.
According to Colonel Mika Holma, the Chief Chief of Staff of the Pori's Brigade, there are no problems with the health situation of other Vice-Presidents.
It appeared that there was an individual incident and that no other servants of that unit had any health problems.
For each announcement, we are honest and we wanted to clarify this matter thoroughly.
At present, it is not known that we have any indoor air problem, Holma says.
The Pricat’s bulletin states that due to the arrival of July, goods must be moved to the army and thus dust could have increased at the moment.
The air may have been as a result of this, it seems to be a gloomy one, but Holma says.
Poverty and death in Indonesia’s suburbs.
Bardin Degei does not use the tenderness of his cooking.
The patient also uses only on rare occasions.
Degei lives in a wooden building in Enarotal, the capital of the region of Pania, located in the province of Papua, Indonesia. When he prepares dinner, he usually puts a badat – locally "no" – directly into his fireplace.
Half an hour later, a burned-out Batat eats greedyly with bare, unwashed hands.
There are no furniture in Degei's home, and he sits on a muddy ground, where he usually also takes care of his daily chores, such as in the cloudy water collected from the near mouth of washing.
The toilet office delivers a bucket in the disappearing room.
Degei is his youngest husband of four wives, and he is not meant to be dealt with in the fields.
Multiple marriages are common here.
Late work can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and many drink a lot. In addition, soldiers must be taken into account.
"No one dares to walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare sneeze on the tops of the everyday Papua, a former Dutch colonial that was joined in Indonesia in 1966. The addition preceded a controversial referendum in which the 1 026 village Elder was forced to vote publicly in front of the occupying forces.
The local independence movement, which opposed the Dutch power, quickly turned its anger around to the Jakarta government, which keeps the area under strict control and prevents foreign suppliers and human rights observers from entering the area.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua. The eastern part of the island belongs to Papua New Guinea.
Enarotali is a remote and a quarter-hour flight from the province's capital, Jayapua to Nabire, and on a stretching five-hour drive on a rental car.
There is no public transport here.
In the town of about 19 000 inhabitants, there are woodlands surrounded by bamboo fences that have been discolored by the rust of the bottom-top roofs.
Only a few Indonesians have come here, not to mention journalists and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Mee Pago tribes worshiped Uga Tamee.
Other changes have taken place.
"We didn't have this kind of clothing," Degei says, and he means his colorful, hand-woven head of spinning, dark teeth and bright hair.
"Until we had only a leaf covered with our bodies."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28 per cent of its inhabitants living below the poverty line, and child mortality and illiteracy are the highest in Asia.
But it is also the land of Indonesia.
Panama is about the size of New Jersey, with 153 000 inhabitants, only about a hundred kilometres from Panama is Grasberg, the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, owned by Freeport McMoran, based in the United States of America.
In 2015, the mine produced $3.1 billion of gold and copper for Freeport.
In addition, there is an estimated $78 billion pool on the beans.
However, these riches bring misery to the Papua, for they mean the repressive existence of a strong army in Indonesia.
In 2005, the New York Times revealed that Freeport provided local military staff and military local units with nearly $20 million in 1998-2004. Individual officers were paid up to $150 000.
This source of income threatens this source of income, and they will be silenced by a barbaric silence.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 500 000 Papuas since 1969 and has raped, tortured and imprisoned thousands of people.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, mass deaths in the upper part of the Papua tribes in the 1970s were related to genocide.
Last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3 900 people in peaceful demonstrations in the area.
In the report of the British Archdiocese in We Will Lose Everity in 2016, there are reports of the brutality of the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture — rape and electric shocks are particularly popular means — and unmistakable attacks on peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of people because there are cases on a weekly basis", says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher of Human Rights Watch.
The rivets have been tightened when Papua’s natural resources attract others from other parts of Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christians, but the population structure is changing when the Indonesian people from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawes islands are moving to the region in the hope of a better income for Muslims.
Jaavawarung canteens sell roasted chicken and gado-gado-gado-hatting blends in a country saucer.
It's hard to compete.
"Migrants have begun to sell chicken and vegetables on the market cheaper than locals," says 24-year-old Abeth You, who is from Pania and has moved to the province capital for work.
"local women lose their clients."
In his 2014 election campaign, the President of Indonesia, Mr Widodo – my favorite, Mr. Jokowi – promised to address the Papuan injustice and human rights violations.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former carpenter won the vote in 27 regions, including Pania, on his way to the President of Jakarta.
Just a little bit has changed in Papua, and locals feel disappointed.
"Our hearts were broken because we voted for Yokow in 2014 and we expected him to fulfill our hope and restore justice," you says.
There was a kind of wave base in the banks only two months after Yokow's turnout.
11 children were attending Christmas shows near the fire in Enarotal on 7 December 2014 when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles appeared out of the dark.
The frightened children told soldiers that they should use driving lights.
Another soldier did not like the remark, according to his pastor Yavedt Tebai, a man returned with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers grabbed the children and assaulted them by cutting them off with rifles.
So one of the soldiers shot the kids in the face.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, fell into a coma following an assault.
A few hours later, the building of the State Electoral Commission near the site was set on fire, and the next day began to happen.
About a thousand Papuans — young men and women and children and children — met in front of the local police station and the military command center to claim justice in the main field.
They had the hunting springs for their festive expenditures, and they began to play the traditional wait dance of the Mee Pago tribe in Papua, where they danced in circles and imitate the bird song.
Some protestors began to stone the buildings of the police and the army.
When the atmosphere warmed up, the soldiers received a command in the internal radio system: "If people resist more than three times, shoot them to death." The information is based on the official document published by the TIME newspaper, which has not been made public to the local media.
The resident of the Yeremias Kayme, 56, Kego Koto region, discovered the situation getting out of hand and asked the people to calm down and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen anymore.
"When I turned around, I was shot on the left wrist," he told TIME magazine about his wooden house painted in bright color on the porch.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot him, but the bullet came from the soldiers' ranks.
"A number of gunshots were shot in the occult."
Alfius Youwia was shot three times, and his cousin saw the shootings.
"I ran to him and made sure it was him," he told the newspaper Yohanes TIME sadly, as many Indonesians do, he only uses one name.
"I saw that he was dead... "I kissed him."
Jotje Mende, a police inspector in Papua, told journalists that the police were only protecting the police station because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us," said Pudjo Sulstiyo, a police officer in Papua, in 2015.
"Then it's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The data was based on data from the day following Jakarta was informed.
Three weeks later, Jokow gave an emotional speech in Jayapur, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to address the violence in Papua.
"I want the case to be investigated immediately so that it never happens again."
In October 2016, the Minister of Security Wiranto said that he would launch investigations on human rights violations outside the justice system.
Anyway, he started to withdraw his speech right away.
"The majority of offences occurred a long time ago,
The 1990s and early 2000s.
The important thing is that we have decided to investigate the infringements, but it requires certain processes", he said.
In an interview with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June 2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said that he was not going to start a report on the Bean.
"All will be settled in court," he told me.
The crimes relate to the death of more than a thousand people in the bloody independence of East Timor in 1999. Wiranto told TIME that 11 cases, including the events in Pania, have already been investigated in the Papua on human rights violations.
The families of the victims of the panic attack the arguments with a blatant disbelief.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed in any way", Yohanes says.
"I'm tired of this."
He's still living in fear, even though it's been years since the event.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I fear the army will arrest me, I fear that I will be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirms that the Panic people are not afraid to discuss the event.
He tells us that the soldiers had abused him after helping him bury four of the victims.
"The soldiers will seek me in their hands after burying the victims," he says.
The ammo is not over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in the neighborhood next to Pania in Deiya.
One and 17 were injured by a conflict between the guests and the head of the construction company, which occurred when the manager refused to take his mind off a man who lost his mind in the hospital, including children among the injured.
The man who needed hospital care was 24 years old, Ravinus Douw, who had been caught in the water while fishing in a nearby river. He died on his way to the hospital.
Innocent villagers showed their minds on a construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the Polish people stoned the police, who responded with a warning signal.
According to local authorities, however, the mobile police department of the Indonesian military police opened fires against the crowd, when one of the villagers was killed.
"We're terrified of revenge," says Domininggu Badii, 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being brought to treatment.
"I've been hiding at home for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for shots to be fired by the policemen who have shot the police on responsibility and the removal of the mobile police unit from the area.
Panama has always been a problem for the Government of Indonesia.
The lack of real development promotes dissatisfaction in the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal genes that live in Papua wheat in the middlelands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), the rebel army which claims to defend the rights of the popes with random attacks and the kidnapping of the Indonesian army's soldiers.
Participants of the OPM are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Yudas Kogoya.
The army has been responsible for the rebellion by arbitraryly arresting and abuseing thousands of people in Pania in the name of 'security of national sovereignty'.
Those in custody will never be returned.
Among the Popes, Panama is known as "a sad, forgotten place".
Poverty protects the unsatisfiedness of poverty.
Enarotal is sold with little wine, and it is also too expensive for the local,
Like bread.
They grow their food themselves: mainly sweets and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Cultivation is the work of women, and one woman may be responsible for four or five sweets.
Most of the harvest is for the family, and the rest is on the market.
Ten sweet sweets cost only 10,000 rubles (75 cents).
Over time, the differences between local and migrant income have increased and the number of migrants has increased since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport.
There are few jobs, and they usually go to better-trained and more wealthy migrants than locals.
Only a few beaners have sufficient capital and know how to run their own company in a competitive manner.
Young people do not want to stay in the village because there is no work or money here," says John Gobai, President of the Panai Council of the tribe.
Insolent Papua remains a small part of the world.
Currently, restrictions on modern information provision are still strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua, even if they had been granted an authorisation, which was officially due to inability to cooperate with local authorities.
According to Phelim Kinen, Asia's Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, Yokow has not held his election promises; he has not increased the profile and has not promoted development by removing information restrictions.
"From Indonesia's restless easternmost provinces, the new suppliers from Papua and West Papua have new risks: refusal of a visa and entering the blacklist", Kine stated in her opinion.
The lack of political freedom means that the Indonesian Government is under pressure only by its neighbours to Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "number and widespread violations of Papua's" and also the Panai shooting.
These countries have also traditionally supported Papua's relief trade.
Arrmanatha Nasir, an informant of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, contested the accusations and told journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of the press, so it would be difficult to cover the evidence of violations of human rights.
The locals want foreign governments to intervene in the matter.
When human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar’s head of the Dutch delegation visited Jayapura on April 5, 2017, the locals broke the silence and expressed their wish for freedom, reports the anonymous source of the meeting.
There are presidential elections in Indonesia, 2019, but the Papans are telling us that they are no longer likely to vote for Jokow anymore.
" Either that means good, but there are people around him who are involved in the Panai shooting scene," says Gobai, President of the tribal council.
He wants to see the situation of the panickers: they live under the influence of a greedy and unpredictable army in the absence of poverty and poverty, in practice without health care and access to education and training.
According to Gobai, the Panics, like the rest of the Pagans, hold the voices of the "debt" that are to be paid back to Yokow.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the victims of the Pania shooting attack once again demonstrated the resistance in symbolic terms: they buried one of the victims in a country opposite the police station and the military office.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let the responsible ones forget their crimes.
"My family member was killed," Yacobus says in his head.
"What else could we do?"
Derek Chisora calls for the cancellation of Robert Helenius' renewal: "Even your own fans don't want to see you."
A series of boxers Robert Helenius and Dereck Chissora were scheduled to fight in Hartwall Arena on 27 May.
However, the operation withdrew for commercial reasons.
In a recent interview with IFL TV, there's a reason to flop the re-election all over Helen's shoulders.
My shooting in Finland was your flop, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland, I don't want to flag there.
It was my Finnish opponent's fault.
Even his fans don't want to see him fight because he's miserable, Chisora's bored.
Helenius and Chisora first met in full Hartwall arena in December 2011.
Henius won the match with a controversial score ruling.
In May, Nisse Sauerland, its promoter, informed Ista-Sanom that the sale was due to take place.
There's nothing new about the fight that's ever heard of it ever since.
On the other hand, the cancellation will no longer be a nuisance for Chisora.
In any case, the fight would have had to have been cancelled after Chisora got sick.
On Thursday, three days before the end of the day, I experienced severe pains.
I had an explosion at the time of my explosion.
At the hospital, they said I had to have a surgery, Chisora tells me.
The British is currently talking about about 45 percent in the current state.
He does not seem to be interested in the re-election with Helenius, but is aiming at Dillian Whyte.
The Krisora suffered a loss to Whyte in December.
The arrival took hold of a second time in the Northwest of the Torch-clibbler.
The flames took over the world's largest residential building in Dubai on Friday. Hundreds of inhabitants were forced to flee from a building with a height of 337 metres from the 79-story building.
This was already another fire in two years in the building, the name of which happens to be Torch, the torch.
The building was emptied, and no one is known to be injured, and the reason for the fire was not understood immediately after the event.
"We were asleep and we woke up to the sound of a fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran stairs down the 50th floor, which took ten minutes," said a resident named George told Reuters.
According to the civil protection authorities in Dubai, the fire forces were set off at four o’clock in the morning and left to cool the building.
The government announced that it would arrange accommodation for those who have left their homes.
The incident may ask again questions about the safety of materials used on the external surfaces of large buildings around the world.
After the fire in 2015, the Board of the Torch Building carried out a study that found that the most damaged were the plates used for the cloaking and insulation of the headgear.
In the UK, police believe that London’s Grenfell Tower insulation and clothing boards may have contributed to the rapid progress of flames in the fire that killed 80 people in June.
In the Joensuu parking lot, a moped was stolen during the night.
A moped mobile parking lot in Joensuu was stolen on Tuesday from 21 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday.
Mopo disappeared from Niinavara from the address at Tikäkinentie 2.
Mopo was at a point in the Sky Team Monkey.
The color is red and the registration number is 27-ReV.
The mop was later found on Thursday.
The police are asking for sightings of a moped or stolen by e-mail to This email address is being protected from spambots.

In the United States, more than 20 per cent of flight passengers take in prohibited items, reveal a survey.
A survey of airport passengers reveals that more than 20 per cent of passengers in the United States of America have taken prohibited items consciously or knowingly or without knowledge of planes through the sites of the U.S. Transport Safety Agency (TSA), at least six of which were knives or other hand-operated objects, which they did not know to be protected.
Less than 1 percent said that they had only learned that they had been carrying weapons, ammunition or explosives by mistake.
More than a thousand passengers responded to the questionnaire and was carried out by the Stratos Jet Charters chartering company. The results also indicate that young passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
19.7 per cent of TSA's conscious travellers were Y-generation representatives and less than 15 per cent belonged to the X-generation.
The most common violation of the rules was the export of food and fluids to the aircraft.
More than 3% admitted consciously to the aircraft that had taken articles equipped with a blade, and 2.2% of women and 3.7% of men reported that they had taken prohibited drugs consciously to the aircraft.
The company that carried out the survey wanted to find out how many people had accidentally carried out security checks and how many people had done so consciously.
It is not surprising that most passengers are also more likely to pass through the security inspection – consciously or consciously – of smuggling goods as well.
But as the company that made the questionnaire notes, the TSA guidelines are very complex and confusing.
Passengers are never sure what liquids they can take to the plane and how much they can take.
So it is no surprise that most of TSA's seizures are liquids.
For some time there was also the belief that the aircraft should not be kept in books.
Liquids may be carried on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Scott Pruitt, Director of the U.S. Environment Agency, decided to delay decisions taken during the Obama period to reduce emissions.
On the day following the challenge by 15 States to the Court of Justice of Scott Pruitt, Director of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Pruitt withdrew its previous decision to refer to the implementation of decisions taken during Obama's management period to reduce smoke emissions.
According to the protocol, the change shows that the agency he manages takes better account of the needs of the regional environmental decision-makers, who are responsible for the environmental issues of the sub-States, of previous administrations and of the environmental policy-makers.
Pruitt did not mention in a single word the action brought against his previous decision before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The States are expected to comply with the 2015 Soil Ozone target from 1.10.2015 onwards.
Pruitt announced in June that he would transfer the implementation of the decisions for one year so that his office would have more time to examine the plan, because the Agency "does not want to interfere with local decision-making or harm economic growth".
Pruitt was the public prosecutor of Oklahoma State before President Donald Trump appointed him as president of EPA. Pruitt is known as the opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or delay the implementation of decisions against the chemical and fossil fuels industries.
The sudden change in the turn of the Wednesday is the latest setback in the Prüitt plan to alleviate the provisions.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington adopted a decision requiring the Director of the EPA to exceed his mandate in trying to postpone the execution of the decision of the Obaman administration concerning oil and gas companies.
In its opinion of Wednesday evening, Pruitt argued that his complete translation of the Otár regulations merely confirmed EPA cooperation with the States in a complex process aimed at fulfilling new requirements according to the timetable.
"In previous administrations, EPA often failed to comply with deadlines and then waited for the activist groups and others to challenge the right to agree on timetables", Pruitt said.
"We do not believe in judicial regulation and take our time limits seriously.
We are also very serious about the regulation on our activities and the powers we give them."
However, the opinion of the EPA concluded that Pruitt could continue to use its "authorities to delay the implementation of decisions and other legal powers" to ensure that the measures "are justified and based on the best available information".
The Republics of the United Nations are in the process of making a broader change to the ozone regulations in the United Nations.
The aim of last month's legislative initiative is to delay the implementation of the 2015 decisions by at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
This week's EPA's appeal to a state-owned association in New York State Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman told us that the group is going to continue to press on.
"EPA's change as a result of our actions is a significant victory for the 6,7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are exposed to direct effects of smoke in their communities," Schneiderman said.
In addition to New York, the complaint included California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Columbia.
Ozone on the ground is generated when emissions of vehicles, power plants, oil refineries and chemicals in the atmosphere react to sunlight in the atmosphere, for example, by emissions from cars, power plants, oil refineries and chemicals.
Thus resulting smoke can cause serious breathing difficulties for sensitive groups of people, which is also a reason for thousands of premature deaths annually.
Public health promoters and environmentalists were glad to see Pruit change in course of action.
"It is a matter of concern how much pressure was required to get the guy responsible for our breath to use common sense," says Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We have yet to fight against the Trump Management, as its ideological aim is to act on the terms of the polluters and other groups that have their own interests."
The manufacturer of cars is coming from a street highway - "in the style of Ferrari".
It also intends to invest in hybrid sports cars while trying to maintain its exclusive position.
This is likely to happen, but it happens in Ferrar's style, CEO Sergio Marchionne said that plans for a press conference would take place on Wednesday.
The details of the new strategy will be revealed next year when the Italian manufacturer of motor cars presents its new five-year plan, the Auto News News news.
All cases of East-Savo ashtrays of the same type of vertebrate species
THL is the same type as the previous cases of East Savo, reporting THL.
The laboratory of virology of the health and well-being body has confirmed on Thursday that the fifth strain of Täe-Savo has been found to be the same as that of previous infections.
THL has ensured that a beach-salt person on Friday 28 July has the same virus as the previous cases of East Savo.
On the basis of this information, all infections found in East Savo relate to the first ash found in the region in June.
The news is good, because that means that we have not been exposed to any other types of Swine virus.
However, it is possible that new infections from the fifth infected may arise between August and August, and therefore the epidemic is not yet over, says medical doctor Mirkaleena Erkkilä, responsible for basic health diseases in Soster.
There have been no new ashtray inspections or suspicions of them since the fifth confirmed case.
However, it is still important for everyone to ensure that their own vaccination protection is up to date, says Erkkilä.
More information: In Pirkanmaa, three new outbreaks of porpoise were confirmed - "Advanced or highly unlikely".
Finland prepares to make a legitimate race.
The cooking of the spot has not yet been considered legalized.
In the background to the criterion that the process produces methanol, along with alcohol, which is toxic, along with methanol.
The production of a race at home will be legal next year, but legalisation of the spot soup will not even be envisaged.
The scream is prepared on the way, while the scream is made by distillation again.
In the light of the regulation of distillation, there is a basis for the process to produce methanol, which is toxic, in addition to wine.
There has been no political will to set a point in the preparation of a soup for every man's right, comments from Ismo Tuomas from the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
When the Ministry prepared for the reform of the law on alcohol, no legalisation of the point-of-sitting process was considered as legalising.
The matter was not brought to a political table either.
There was no debate on the liberalisation of distillation, and Congressman Outi Mäkelä (Kok.) notes.
He is in a negotiating group of government parliamentary groups who took a stand on the reform of the law on alcohol.
In the future, even the application cannot be granted for distillation at the home of a natural person.
Commercial manufacturing will be preserved as a licensor.
Importing tells us that home-making of alcoholic beverages will be a simple rule: alcohol can be produced by going home.
This means that, in addition to beer, cider and wine, you can legally scream at home.
The government has tried to simplify the provisions.
The new law will eliminate the requirements of flavourings and flavourings and allow for the production of sprat, Mäkelt to be specified.
The manufacture must continue to take place in such a way that the raw materials or the flavourings and flavourings resulting from their use are clearly visible from the drinking process.
Under the law, drinks may be prepared for themselves as much as they want, and self-employed alcohol may be given as a gift.
It must still not be made available for sale.
Making a song is no longer a public health problem in Finland, Tuomis believes.
A larger change took place in 2004, when imports of passengers from Estonia and other EU countries were released.
75 per cent of the alcohol used in Finland is imported from Estonia.
The alcohol bill is now being examined by the Ministry of Justice.
The Alcohol Act will be submitted to the Parliament as soon as it starts its term of office.
The plenary session is held at 5.9.
The Act will enter into force at the beginning of 2018.
The law is well prepared.
It's like a parliament has already taken a stand, Mäkelä is happy.
The Oscar Pistorus was praised as being escorted to the hospital by armed guards.
The Oscar Pistorius, who had suffered chest pain, was praised for his heart problems at the hospital in South Africa.
Pistorus has already gotten out of the hospital.
The Oscar Pistorus suffered a prison sentence in Issaridgeville Prison.
According to the British newspaper Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital this morning with armed guards.
He suffered from chest pain, but he got out of the hospital this afternoon.
The officer of the prison confirmed that Pistorius was taken to the hospital for research.
On the other hand, the informant of the pisturitus's family told us that the former top athlete was fine.
Last summer, the Supreme Court condemned the gold medallion of the six-time paralympics for six years for murdering his girlfriend Reeva Stenkamp.

Unleashed telephone conversations reveal that Mr. Trump was under pressure from Mexico to build a border barrier.
The littering of telephone conversations between President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia has leaked to Washington Post.
In a phone conversation on 27 January 2017 Mr. Trump called on the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, to stop his public speeches about his intention not to pay for the proposed border wall.
The United States President of the United States of America told Nieto that he had knocked down a wall project in public. "You can't say that to the press", Trump said.
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the permission of building a wall on the US southern border at the expense of Mexico.
The Washington Post also published an littering on the first call from the Trump to the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, during which a intense exchange of words took place during the call.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take refugees on their way to Australia would be "insolent", "insolent", "insolent" and "insolent". According to the Trump, the agreement negotiated during Obama would make him look like an "idiot" because he had proposed a ban on the residence of refugees in the United States of America.
Trump stopped calling by telling Turnbull that "this was the most uncomfortable call all day.
massacre in Georgia: Entrepreneurs re-arranged racist lynch in the hope of justice.
The car of the Ford Mercury sign passes the crowd in the suburbs of Monroe in the countryside of Georgia and continues its journey towards a small bridge between Moore's Ford.
There are four black passengers and a white driver in the car, four armed men blocking the road before the car gets to the bridge.
A middle-aged man dressed in a sober suit takes a deep breath of his carotid and wanders through the windshield through the windshield.
Passengers are scared.
"Roger, n-!
"Out of the car!"
Loss breaks the silence when a young black man pulls out of the front.
Fortunately, this shocking event is just a re-shipment, which was presented on 22 July 2017.
The shocks are, however, genuine when you put a hangover on Roger's neck.
Since 2005, the Human Rights Organisations have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to re-arrange the events of last year. At that time Ku Klux Klan lynked two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
"It is confusing that no one has been arrested in these years – even though the killers live in our lives and many need to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who will help with the recharge arrangements.
"It is a shadow of history, but above all it is a burden that crushes our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old civil society activist and a former Georgia Representative.
Reshipment to him is a shocking invitation to act, and it also reminds the people of Monroe that the injustice has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to get justice. We want things to be finished, and we want to recover from grief and make peace, but above all we want justice", Brooks says.
"We cannot recover and make peace until we have justice."
The coroner will cover the body of a dead victim who died in the massacre in Georgia on 27 July 1996.
According to FBI documents received by NBC, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were suspected of lynching.
However, no one was accused of murder.
Although the perpetrators have been free for decades, activists say that the motives of lynching have always been known to the general public: politics and sex.
In 1946, black people in the state of Georgia were given the Supreme Court's decision to vote for the first time in the presidential elections. The Supreme Court passed its decision in April, and the elections were held in summer.
According to the F.B.I., there was an incident at the time of the election in which the black farmer Roger Malcom stabbed the white landowner Barnett Hester in a fight that apparently involved Malcom's wife Dorothy.
According to Brooks, there was a rumor in the city that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was pregnant with her child.
According to the F.B.I., the powerful White Landowner, Loy Harrison, informed of the 25 July 1946 Malcom's $600 guarantee for which he was released from prison.
On their way home with Malcom and Dorothy, their cousins were Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The crowd stopped their car before Moore's Ford's bridge.
"It turns out that Harrison ordered and committed the murders," says the FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and the local authorities, and the authorities were involved in the murders and lost the evidence and did not reveal the identity of the witnesses."
The brooks express the matter more clearly.
"It was a voter's murder," he says.
"They were murdered because they wanted to tell black people that they would do the same if they were to vote."
Cassandra Greene has been directing the attack on Georgia's blood for over a decade already.
The presentation is extremely realistic and persuasionable, a picture of the shocking racism that many believe is already missing in the United States of America today.
It's hard to see the show, but it's even harder not to see what Green thinks it's all about.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because we had to face our own dark side too," the director says.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
This year’s performance began in June. On the first day, about 30 actors – a nation of blacks and a few whites – met to listen to Greene’s routinely summary of the draft.
Wade Marbaugh acts as Greene's assistant director.
For years, he has been giving the local Ku Klux Klan the head of the re-arrangement, but the role is always as difficult and disgusting as it is.
"It's getting dirty because I'm not myself," Margaugh says.
"It is important, however, that this aspect of history is also displayed so that it will never be repeated again."
On the other side of the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, are practicing on the other side of the room.
The motion is on the scene where Malcom calls and works on the Hester, and he is upset that Hester has had an affair with Dorothy.
I told you to leave my country, n-u!"
Rasona ie Hester responds.
Then we'll hit the target.
And then all (at least all the black actors) will burst into laughter.
Roe laughs harder than that.
"What?" marcona asks.
She's all right.
"Did I accidentally hit too hard?" he asks.
"Et," Green's gonna be fine.
"I just don't think the whites used the word n-u at the time."
"Yes," another black actor confirms.
"It's slang, you need to use a longer version."
The subject of the motion is unpleasant, but the room's power is a person of interest.
Everyone wants to succeed, and not just for the performance, they want to respect the memory of those who have been killed.
Start again.
Now the words of Cona are ringing.
No one's laughing.
The retransmission will end quickly and violently.
Hustle, shots — and silence.
A woman dressed in a black funeral dress standing next to the bodies and singing Billie Hun Strange Fruit.
His voice breaks in every other word.
A few ten metres away, five-thirty viewers wipe out sweat and tears from their eyes.
About half of the audience is black and half white.
There is a couple who have come to watch a performance from Ithaca, New York State, but most of them are local.
They have visited Brooks’s indiscriminate graves at the graves of the victims in Georgia’s pressurizing humidity.
The floods have changed from the story to the truth. The atmosphere at the site of the incident is heavy.
After the proposal for a song, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
The children wonder about the crime and the immobilized bodies and whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead", little boy mutts like he reminds himself of himself.
In a few minutes, Greene will thank the public.
Actors who have proposed boxers take off their caps and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaughi, a man appointed by the local director of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs two actors and then bursts into tears after a rough show.
"Don't worry," the woman who was on the show makes me feel better.
"We know you're not him.
You did this for good."
Later, the public and the actors will meet for a common dinner.
The white couple who have arrived from the pool will be actively discussing the performance with the black couple they have just met.
Denise Doubleinski's hard to find words when she describes the feelings of the performance.
"It is hard to listen to terrible words and watch the terrible things that they say and do people who look like you – precisely because they look like you," he says.
"My presentation found that lynchages are still happening," he added. "They're just called arrests."
On the other side of the room, Brooks recalls the development of civil rights for the audiences sitting at the same table.
He says he's already started planning next year's presentation.
"Relanding is a powerful experience because it is a picture of the horrors we experience, but it is also an educational experience", says Brooks.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't take note of it.
Those who do not know their history shall be judged to repeat it."
Sprinkling up plants in trades is hovering: the elimination of this kind of "extreme parts" actually saves us.
Is it allowed to remove the leaves of cauliflowers before weighing already in the store?
How much do you think to take out a big piece of anaesthetic - that's gonna get a lot more, don't you think?
Answers are strongly shared by opinions: for one it is a manifestation of a highly exported procedure, while for another it does not want to pay for parts of vegetables that are not used and which, however, go home to trash.
The manifest will be identified in goods.
For example, there are cardboard boxes in the vegetable department of the Ghöholahti K-Citymark, for example, because many rip off the leaves of the flower kale, for example.
From the box, the leaves are exported to organic waste.
According to the news published by economics, nuisance by a vegetable ski is admiring traders.
But how much of the extra parts of vegetables that are removed before weighing are actually saving money?
How important a misdemeanor is this really about?
The women tested how the price changes when they take the leaves or bear off the pineapple, latva-artisoka, sweeteners, broccoli and cauliflowers.
Cauliflower: €2.10 price paid for cauliflower cabbage came to €1.80 when it peeled out all the leaves.
Bananas: The price of whole Ananas paid by EUR 2,30 fell to EUR 1,95 when the stock was turned off.
Latva artichokes: EUR 2,60 became EUR 2,40 when the short-term position was cut off.
Herbs: Two sweeteners cost a total of 75 cents.
Stocks in the atmosphere were priced at 60 cents.
Broccoli: The average practitioner made up EUR 1 and without air of 80 cents.
Result: If leaves and stocks are to be cut off, save at least a few tens of cents at least at one vegetable.
By 1%, the price of vegetables fell by up to 20 per cent.
So for these purchases, a total of EUR 1,20 would have been saved.
Neymar was bought out of Barcelona - the march star signed a five-year contract with the PSG.
President Neymar has concluded a five-year contract with the French FOFF Society's PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid FC Barcelona FC in Spain’s league a purchase price of EUR 222 million.
The maximum amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of the country.
The last record was on the United States, which last summer was EUR 105 million from French Paul Pogba.
It was too late for the transfer earlier on Thursday, when it abandoned the first payment transaction for Neymar's representatives.
Under the League rules, the club cannot pay the purchase price directly to the seller, but the player has to buy out his contract itself, which is done by recycling money through the league.
In practice, the PSG has paid the sum to Neymar and his representatives, who delivered the money through the league to Barcelona.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
He may be consulted at the opening of the PSG period against the public authorities on Saturday.
Uefa Details
In addition, Barcelona informed of its information on the payment to Uepha of the European Union, in order to enable the Union to determine any disciplinary action that might arise from the case.
Among other things, the President of the Spanish League, Javier Tebas, has suspected that PSG would commit a violation of the rules of fair competition in Uefa by using its money.
Uefa can punish a company that makes more than EUR 30 million loss over a period of three years.
According to Uepha, Neymar's transfer does not automatically break its economic section.
Neymar’s transfer to PSG affects the company’s business for many years, but the impact cannot be estimated in advance.
For example, PSG may enter several players with a considerable amount of money, Uefa was informed.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned gladiary company.
The successor shall be chaired by a former Tesammatist, a Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi, former Tesammatist.
Ten shirts for Neymar.
Austin, 21, was hit by a sharper burn from a lightning strike - a flash was stored in the airport's security camera.
Austin Dunn was in the process of doing normal work on a plane at the South-West Florida International Airport with a couple of colleagues when suddenly the rain from the rain sky hit the machine.
The power of the lightning threw the machine into the land of Dunn near the wing of the plane.
Dun's hurry to the hospital was Dun's time.
He had first-degree burns in his body.
My father called me and said that my brother had an electric shock and he's in the hospital.
I was just asking if he was alive, and Austin's sister Autumn says.
Austin spent two weeks in a hospital.
In addition to the burns, he had muscle damage and bleeding in the brain.
The experience was hard for the whole family.
You don't know how to predict it.
It's a trauma signal for everyone, Autumn tells you.
According to the airport representative, the lightning risk warning system was in place at the time of the event and the transport movement itself decides whether to do so.
Pearson reduces 3 000 jobs and stimulates business by cutting dividends.
The British training group Pearson announced this Friday that he would reduce 3 000 jobs and cut the dividend by 72% when starting a new restructuring programme in response to pressures on his business.
According to CEO John Fallon, job reductions are mainly carried out at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019. The company has already reduced 4 000 jobs in connection with previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that he would again cut costs by 300 million pounds in May as part of his third saving programme, which was designed to revive the business that was weakened as a result of rapid digitalisation.
Last month Pearson decided to sell his share of Penguin's Rand House to Bertelsmann, who announced that it would keep its outlook for the current year unchanged and that its turnover increased by one per cent in the first half of the year and amounted to GBP 2,05 billion.
A hit hit in Kabul: NATO's soldier was killed in an accident.
A suicide bomber struck a military escort in the capital of Kabul, Afghanistan, and according to the authorities, the NATO soldier was killed and several others injured.
According to NATO's opinion, five soldiers and an interpreter were injured in the attack.
Unconfirmed local data indicate that three larvae have also been killed in an attack in the Qatari area of Kabul.
The explosion is the last violent blow in Afghanistan this month. On Tuesday, 30 people were killed by an explosion in the Mosque in Awake.
On Monday, two people were killed in a suicide bomber attack at the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO’s statement, Thursday evening’s explosion occurred when a joint patrol between NATO and the Afghan army was attacked by an attack on a self-propelled explosive device.
The opinion stated that everyone who had been injured was stable and was treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
According to journalists, the confirmation of the Taliban and the presence of an ISIS terrorist organisation in Qarabagh are important concerns for NATO troops near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan, of which 20 % were killed in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in a suicide attack in Kabul, an area in which mainly shiiamuslims live.
The Taliban reported that they were behind the attack.
On the last day of May, in the centre of Kabul, over 150 people were killed in a bombing that was the most devastating munitive attack on the Earth after the United States leaders attacked the Taliban in 2001.
The violence stresses the unstable situation in Afghanistan when President Donald Trump is considering whether or not the United States will send more troops to help the local army and the police.
According to journalists, recent suicide attacks in Kabul have also seriously undermined people's confidence in the government, their policies, and in particular President Ashraf Ghan.
The European Parliament and the Council decide to postpone the implementation of the smoke-in provisions.
The U.S. Environment Agency EPA decided to delay the implementation of decisions taken during Obama's management period to reduce smoke emissions following the date on which the 15 States had been sued by the Agency.
The EPA announced its decision on the implementation of the so-called "opinions" 2015 late on Wednesday, and according to the Agency, the decision is an indication of its commitment to cooperation with the States.
"We believe in dialogue and we want to respond to the needs of the States," said Scott Pruitt, Director of the Agency in the opinion.
Pruitt announced in June that the Agency’s intention to postpone implementation of the ozone definitions by one year October 2018. According to the definition, the smoke ratio is to be measured in certain parts of the country in order to determine where pollution should be reduced in accordance with stricter air quality standards.
On Tuesday, the Agency challenged 15 mainly the state of the rule of democracy, including the District of Columbia, which said that the suspension of the execution was illegal.
The management of President Donald Tõmp has sought ways to mitigate the environmental regulations of Barack Obama, and according to the latter, measures are part of a broader programme for economic growth.
The more effective measures have been opposed by Democrats and environmentalists who are concerned about the health effects of the increase in emissions.
According to the EPA website, breathing ozone-rich air may weaken lung function and increase respiratory symptoms, such as asthma.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of the father had also sent a bomb of building parts to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was meant to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the security inspection was carried out.
The police are not going to tell us why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas release device and to take the device to a public place, such as a public transport device.
Deputy Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
On the basis of the suspected terrorist attacks, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but even his interrogations are being conducted.
Este's CEO: Renewable fuels were doing well.
Oil refinery Liquide's profit before taxes fell, but struck forecasts in the second quarter.
According to President Matti Lievose, the company did good in its oil products, the sales volumes of renewable products rose to record level and the operating profit of the Marketing & Services segment was in the right direction.
Last year, comparable operating profit was improved by the US Blenders Tax Credit tax incentive.

the implementation of our strategy is progressing well.
We will continue to focus on our customers and growth projects, and we will be able to complete the planned investments that we have already announced in 2017, Lievonen said in the communication.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomatšenko will discuss a possible match at their first meeting.
The first time on Thursday, Vasyl Lomatšenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be at a collision course towards the most interesting boxing match of a series of less than 66.7 kg in the near future, faced the second time on Thursday.
The men were in their own room in ESPN sports canal facilities in Los Angeles, until the WBC's undefeated light series master Mikey Garcia walked down the hall to greet Lomatashenko, the superior feathered master of the WBO.
Garcia won on Saturday on Showtime with the unanimous decision of the former four-weight world champion, Adrian Broner. Since then, Garcia and Lomatšenko have been among the five best among the different weight-class boxers on a comparable side.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and asked, "How's it going, Master?
Good luck!"
Lomatšenko defends his title Miguel Marriaga against ESPN on Saturdays.
When the two poses for photographers, the manager of Lomatšenko Egis Klimas observed that the match between men would be "perfect in terms of size.
"I'm a former feather type," Garcia reminded me of.
"I've moved up the series [63.5 kilos] for the Bronzer, but I'm not that big.
I'm a small 63.5 kg.
I want to get back into the extractive series.
He's got to get up to the CCS [1.2 kilos], and then we can fight.
That's what our fans want.
Complete their wishes."
Lomatšenko agreed with him.
"Flying needs this match."
Klimas asked if the match should be organised on the pay channel, which is part of his strategy for Lomatchenko to debut in the series later this year and to fight against Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts). Garcia would also be interested in meeting the winner of the match between Jorge Lineres and Luke Campbell. Linares and Campbell are fighting in the round series at Forum on 23 September.
"Operation could be on the payline because fans have asked for it", Garcia said and later announced that she would be ready to fight on the edge that offers the best prize package.
"We are the most interesting names.
No one else gets as much attention as anyone else.
It's okay for me as soon as we reach an agreement..."
Garcia said that she appreciated Lomatšenko as a "unbelieving fighter" and that she might want to go see Saturday's match.
Lomatšenko interrupted the frame on the mountain of Garcia and said that this three-weight master from Corfu seemed "really slow. Sorry, Mike... but you needed that knock."
Garcia said that she was focused on showing first the power of impact and then boxing.
The men said that they felt that the fight between them was intended to take place more and more strongly.
"This is the match to be expected.
No other match will attract as much attention and interest as you do.
I am absolutely involved in this case", Garcia said.
Lomatšenko said that he expected to be able to fight against the best. "Mikey is a legend.
It's gonna be a great game."
Average wage of EUR 5 300, training what happens - the situation of investment advice was "boil and free".
The quality of investment equipment has talked a lot recently.
The last time he told us about Ritva, 68, who was told by the banker's investment firm when he sold all the investment products.
Investment firms and different rules on the sale of investment products will become more stringent at the beginning of next year.
These reductions are based on the new Financial Markets Directive, which will start to apply from the beginning of next year.
Currently, the assessment of the skills of investment firms and employees selling investment products is mainly based on self-regulation.
There are no specific requirements for know-how in the law.
Financial sector (FA) itself recommends that those working in an investment firm perform its own APV1 or APV2 qualification.
The financial sector has been authorised to organise qualifications for a company called APV Investments Oy, which is a study group with experts from both Financial Control (Fiva), universities and industry.
The qualifications range from 12-15 credits to 12-15 credits, and their exams are developed by Aalto EE, the University Executive Education Oy, which provides business management development services.
Its website says that in general, both exams are "very comprehensive in relation to the requirement.
The educational material of qualifications includes 10-15 books and a number of other guides and works.
Markku Savikko, Executive Director of APV Investment Studies Ltd, reports that the percentage of passing of exams is roughly 70 % of the estimate.
Of the largest number of large banks, approximately all providers of investment services have completed either the APV1 or the APV2 qualification because their performance is mandatory according to the company’s own rules.
There will then be smaller bank movements without mentioning the names of staff affected by the completion of the qualifications, Savik says.
According to him, such banking transactions are "others".
According to the plot, the APV1 qualification has completed between 13,000 and 14,000 persons since 2000 and the more demanding APV qualifications recommended to investment vehicles are about 3 000 persons.
Businesses consider the conduct of a qualification to be an advantage.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements.
Fine says that the Financial Recommendation requires the completion of APV qualifications, because that is the time when the very knowledge of the investment sector will be ensured.
According to Statistics Finland, on average, financial and investment intermediaries earn several thousand euros per month, including commissions, natural resources and income.
The average daily working hours of monthly earnings is approximately EUR 5 300.
On average, working men make a monthly sum of EUR 5 900 per month and women over EUR 4 500 per month respectively.
On average, the average ten of the highest earners earn approximately EUR 8 100.
The largest number of successful men earns more than EUR 9 000 per month or more, one in ten of the most successful women earns EUR 6 400 or more.
An investment firm may only be granted by an authorised company by an investment firm.
To date, the level of employment and occupation has been entrusted with self-regulation.
According to the report, the inspection carried out by it faced a number of cases where the professional qualifications and qualifications of the retailer were not sufficient on the basis of the adviser's activities.
In principle, investment products can also be sold, even if their skills and qualifications are at a low level.
Originally, in this case, the situation has been wild and free.
Several other sectors have considerably stricter skills requirements, Savik says.
According to the schedule, from the beginning of next year, this will be tightened up with the new MiFID II (MIFID II) directive.
This requires each undertaking to be responsible for ensuring that the staff providing investment services are sufficiently skilled.
Financial control, in turn, may be empowered to determine what to know.
Fiva’s market operator, Marko Hovi, tells us that one of the clear changes to the current situation is a adaptation of the knowledge and experience requirements for investment firms and investors of investment products.
According to the court, the new requirements apply to both investment firms' own staff and related agents who sell products on behalf of a company.
The Court reports that according to the proposal of the Government of the Ministry of Finance, Fiva may be given the power to determine knowledge and experience.
What exactly they are will be decided by these visions during the coming season.
The company will also have to continue to provide the necessary training and, where appropriate, monitoring and continuing training.
All of this has to be documented, and the company has the right to proof that this has been done as well.
The Court states that, in practice, the company must, for example, identify staff’s work images at an individual level.
There will certainly be different criteria for this depending on whether it is an investment or a sale of products.
According to the Court, it is also important to work with someone more experienced if knowledge or experience is not at an adequate level.
So if the company hires a new employee who does not fully meet the defined criteria, the employee must work with the person who meets the criteria for a certain period of time.
According to the court, the change will result in more stringent and concrete rules.
The legislation on the sale of investment products will become more stringent at the beginning of 2018.

The flight route of the aircraft was drawn above the United States of America in the service of Flightradar 24.
The flight was performed on Thursday 787 Dreamliner, where Boeing tested the sustainability of the aircraft Rolls Royce engines on a long flight.
The aircraft that left Seattle flew for 18 hours and 1 minute 15 700 kilometres, which is longer than any existing permanent commercial route in the world.

Imatra's sinister beach swimming schools do not have rain or sun roasting - Iines Kaikkonen stowed sturdyly with the help of the bathing village.
Eine Kaiknen moved forward at good speed, Taina Itänen followed.
Imatra beach swimming schools are running in Liette and Lemple for this and next week.
Even if it rains and then cooks again, young swimmers are not mishaps, says Taina Itkenen, the director of bathing schools.
In this week's bathing school, swimming skills are mapped out by a total of 13 children, next week by the province.
The impact on the number of children in the coming week was that at the time the school and the Eskar began to start, it assessed Itkonen.
Imatra beach swimming school is organised in cooperation with the Lukunta Association project and the city of Imatra.
Thursday, on the shore of Liette, it was a nice atmosphere.
The sun was shining and young bathing schoolchildren were training to stay on the ground with swimming pools, someone without it.
The water also enjoyed smaller larvae.
In the middle of Kaik, 5, first went further into the water.
Taina Itänen moved her, however, to push her to the beach.
You're doing great.
Eine Kaikänen told me that he had been to a lot of swimming this summer.
Swimwear is good at doing all right.
Like all things, Vii Hähtnen, 5.
You too should be pleased with today's achievements, swimming praise.
Jami Kallio, 4, again wanted to visit the Water Wars sometime.
My daughter Anna Vilberg, 6, followed by Ilona Vilberg on the beach, considers the beach swimming school a good start for swimming.
Even if the weather has been what happens, it's Anna's every day wanting to go here.
He always had to be warm.
The swim-schoolers packed on the pier.
The boys had enough with the frog at the beach to find it.
Milya Lopkonen, 3, and Anna Vilberg spread the towels to the platform, grazed the fruit and roasted the day.
The teaching in the water continued, but there was no hurry on the ground.
The way it doesn't belong in summer.
I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, there's this story that's going to be a connection.
She sees all kinds of things.
A couple of days ago, the Blue Product, which makes cleaning products, launched an Unknown X series of products.
So the brushes and the towels and the "whine brush with the edge of the brush".
An unknown soldier refers here to the film and film marketing that will be received at first night.
Then there is something special about the combination, and the products have been passed off on social media: Where do Unknown health care come from?
I have to call the company and ask what this is all about.
What does Aino Määtä, Vice-President of Siniprote, say?
We are the partnership of the film.
We support this film, as are many other companies.
We wanted to support domestic production and cultural film, I don't know.
According to him, the products come with a special look at, and the film gets a view of them.
Isn't this a little funny - often when you think that products and their related stories have something in common?
That's what this is all about. That we are a Finnish operator and these are Finnish products, I'm telling you, Mätä.
According to him, the company supports his same basic Finnish values as those in favour of those who have seen the old Unknown soldiers.
Cleaning up is not even a stranger to the military culture, Määtte points out.
Other business partners of the unknown military film include: Valio, Hartwall, Saludo, VR and Sato.
So far, for example, Hartwall's vichyts, known as Rokka, Hietanen and Koskela, have been introduced to the market.
Unrecognised products were already released from Finland's photo magazine blog Kalle Kinunen.
There are also coffee and watches available.
Kinunen points out that there is still time for the film to start, so there is still room for further work.
For example, Valio, the breeder, Neste and the German retailer Lidl, Kinnunen, have not yet been exposed to their war products by the unknown partners.
New results of the Swedish age tests for asylum seekers were published.
The results of tests carried out using the new method of evaluation indicate that more than 80% of the tests were determined to be over 18 years of age. However, not all consider tests to be reliable.
The Swedish National Agency for Legal Affairs started testing earlier this year.
The tests can be used to estimate the age of an asylum seeker. A new test was introduced after the Swedish Immigration Service was assessed for failure to determine the actual age of applicants who claimed to be underage.
The Finnish Immigration Service has carried out 6 880 tests so far, and the Agency for Legal Affairs has now published the results of 2,481 tests. The tests were carried out between mid-March and late July 2017.
80 % of the test, i.e. 2002 applicants for asylum, were determined to be over 18 years of age. In addition, the Legal Service determined 25 cases where the test was "potentially 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the applicant for asylum was "if possible under 18 years of age.
The tests were performed only in cases where there was reason to suspect the age indicated by the applicant.
Johannsson from the Legal Service tells us that the results are consistent with the results of previous months.
"The figures are fairly uniform. Big differences in the statistics for the previous months are not detectable", he told The Local newspaper.
Although most of the applicants were determined to be over 18 years of age, this does not necessarily mean that the applicants would have lied to their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of the 581 tests and announced that in 442 cases there were "refers that the investigator was 18 years old or older.
When Svenska Dagblade examined the same results, it appeared that in 243 cases the applicant had openly declared that he was 18 years old this year.
The method of assessing physical age used in the tests takes pictures of the wisdom teeth and the magnetic images of the knee joints, and then the dentists and radiologists analyse the images. The method has also been criticised.
One of the suspects is the artikrologist Claude Marcus of the Karoliinen Institute, whose work consists of an assessment of the human bio maturity. The evaluation can determine whether a person has received a change from a person sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I think that the method used is not the right one.
The determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we are not sure about age, we should not pretend that we can do it," he said to the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson, the Justice Office, defended the accuracy of the tests: "It is generally possible to say that the risk of determining a child's childhood is low.
The greatest risk is in a situation where the test is near 18 years old, which means that the risk is about 10%."
Ilone's legend has 30 places in Scotland and has 30 places to live in Scotland.
The five-to-five par result in the third round was spent by Mikko Ilosen on the 30th edition of the result track downwards the golf European tour in competition in Scotland.
Ilonen left on Sunday from the split place 11 but was found at the end of the round from the split point 41.
There was a very difficult one for three bugs to be followed by one double bug.
Others had a lot to do with it, too.
The English Ian Poulter went up to share the main point in a round under the par, even though he told us that there was a lot of work on the umbrella lengths.
The hare was raw, but I was hanging out with him, and then the day was good, Poulter wind.
He shares his leading countryman with Callum Shinkwin and Australian Andrew Dodt.
The Governor of the West of Virginia will change the party.
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that on Thursday evening at the Trump campaign we would like to discuss the party.
"The Democrats were just letting me go," he said.
"Today I can tell you, after many prayers and in-depth discussions, that today I will tell the West Virginians that I can no longer help you as the Governor of the Democrats."
The audience opened up to ravaged applause.
"Tomorrow as a member of a registered Republican Party", Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say to you that it is time for a new game."
Trump promised earlier that a significant announcement would be made at the Western Virginia campaign.
Trump won at 42 points in West Virginia because Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected Governor in 2016. According to Forbes, he is the only billionaire in his state.
He inherited from his father a mining company and owns coal mines in five states.
The value of his assets is approximately $1.59 billion.
On Thursday evening, the Committee of the Republics (RNC) published an opinion saying that "the change of governor Justice's party is another blow to a democratic party that is building barriers rather than better America."
"Democracys have only 15 governors and fewer states than ever before. In this context, Justice's announcement is the last setback for a party that has no leadership and is unable to find a positive, people-to-people message", Ronna McDaniel, representative of the C.R.C., noted in her statement to CBS's news.
The lightning ingested damage - Thursday is going to be even summer’s very busy day in the summer.
From the end of the week, there will also be more thunders in Southern Finland.
Over the past week, he has been screaming, especially in the central and north parts of the country and in the Southern Finland region.
During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, several fires were set on fire.
According to the meteorologist, Thursday may be a very busy day of the summer so far.
Even Finland has finally been found by the mists.
Over the past week, particularly in the middle and north of the country and in the south-west Finland region, has been leaking over the past few years.
On the table, lightning struck a lineless power station, causing a small fire.
The rescue facility received a report of the fire about 15 minutes or half a Wednesday.
The power station was located in the sauna space at the end of the row.
The rescue facility shut down the roof and wall to find the fire seals and quickly extinguished the fire.
A total of eleven homes were left without electricity, but no personal accidents were avoided.
In the area again, the lightning lit the building on the outskirts in Harjuland before midnight.
On the arrival of the rescue facility, the building was already full at the time of the fire, and the rescue facility could not but prevent the spread of the fire.
The exterior of about fifty square metres of size burned to the ground.
In the direction of the death, another lightning struck the home house.
The residents of the house were outside the building and witnessed a striking lightning attack.
The rescue facility visited the site to check the case, but this time the lightning didn't get a fire - only a few fuses high.
In traffic, the thunder caused problems on the train track between the Seinäjoki and Vaasa, when the impact damaged the traffic control system.
This information was received from 8 p.m. to 9 a.m. on Thursday morning, after which trains were replaced by buses.
The problem could not be corrected until a short time before five afternoons.
As a rule, transport by rail has reached the end of the day also at the track section of the loud-boiled noise.
Salads have soaked all over Finland.
However, the encryption has been relatively limited this summer.
This summer’s silences have been so horrific! assesses the weather department’s on-call meteorologist Jari Tuovinen.
Wednesday and Thursday’s thunderstorms have been mainly moderate, but thanks to the small rainfall of summer, this too seems to be a lot more than a year old.
This might seem like a true hard-ass mist, but that's what it's been like this summer since the middle of the summer, says Toovinen.
On Wednesday, the earth’s rain fell 1,700 times, and on Thursdays there has been potential even for the toughest of the summer: by about 16 o’clock, there were 1,790 land in the placard.
If the lightning is still on the beginning side of the evening, more than two thousand lightnings can be reached, the Importable Prophecy.
The previous weak record year was launched in 2015, when the year’s flash was about 30,000 pieces.
By Wednesday, this year’s amount of lightning had risen to 18 386 lightning.
So it is still interesting that this year does not break the two-year "preliminary record".
However, it can be expected that the occipital can continue.
According to the imports, Finland will also remain in the air during the rest of the week, fresh and moist, which is a natural environment that is acceptable to the highlands.
By Saturday, the main focus of the doors will be transferred from the north of the country to the south, where about 2,000 lightning days can be obtained both on Saturdays and Sundays.
There is a more integrated rainland in the central part of the earth.
According to this kind of Tuovinen, it's only rare to shout at.
Coe congratulates Russia on its "obsessive" apology for the doping scandal.
The world's sports boss, Sebastian Coe, praised his generous apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but Coe added that it was not yet time to terminate the Russian ban on participation.
At the IAAF Conference on Thursday morning of the World Cup, the Russian Director of Public Sports Dmitri Shahitin said that the ban on Russia was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted 'for all the athletes who were taken to the competitions for gold or silver medals'.
Despite his comments, the IAAF Office voted in favour of the extension of the ban. Russia was excluded from public sports competitions in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Office WADA report showed evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think his answer today was very straightforward. It was a very generous presentation," said Coe, President of IAAF, to the journalists.
"Whether the Council and the Assembly were pleased that the Russian Association of Public Sports has been through difficult times and announced that they would do everything in their power to reorganise their activities."
Coe also said that he was "satisfied" with Russia's acceptance of the conditions for the conclusion of the ban.
"I think it was a very constructive day and progress has been made, but the Convention supports the recommendation of the working party that it is not the right time to end the Russian ban," Coe said.
"We must do everything in our power to normalize the situation in the coming months.
The main reason has always been that we want to keep pure athletes separate from the corrupt system," he added.
Nine Russian athletes compete with the status of a neutral athlete in London in the competitions for public sport at the World Championships starting on Friday. They have met the strict criteria of the IAAF.
Rune Andersen, Director of the IAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet many requirements before its position can be restored.
"The testing is still insufficient, and the disabled coach is still working freely", he told the suppliers this Friday after the presentation by IAAF to the Council in London.
The production company was disappointed in the weak success of the Tom of Finland film.
The film of the Tom of Finland did not show the success that the authors hoped for, says Yle.
If I tell you the truth, I am disappointed to admit that the film was produced by the CEO of the Helsinki Film, Annika Sucksdorff Yle, in an interview.
I was afraid that the Finnish party convention could be conservative, and it seems that it is.
The film got its first night in February 2017.
By the end of June, it had reached a fair 100 000 viewers, which is a small amount compared to the film budget, some EUR 5 million, compared to the film budget.
This didn't turn out to be any lottery profit, but now it's important that investors get their own back.
If the film had been more successful in their home country, they would have already received their money.
Now we have to wait for a small stream of foreign distribution, says Sucksdorff.
Of Finland is a film directed by Dome Karuksusken.
How the economic rules of the country affect the transfer of Neymar to Paris by Neymar.
The provisions restricting the use of European coins do not prevent the transfer of Neymar from Spain Barcelona to Paris Paris Saint-Germain in France, the most expensive transfer of the time.
Its possible sanctions for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) will be decided by the European football regulator UEFA, who may prevent teams from participating in the prestigious Masters League.
The UEFA introduced the economic rules for fair play in 2011, according to which PSG must be able to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer has been financed without significant losses.
EUR 222 million was paid to Barcelona for the end of the Brazilian agreement, and Neymar's annual salary in the new company will flow in tens of millions of dollars.
The transfer of Neymar to France involves a wide range of economic aspects.
PSG has no difficulty in paying Neymar's transfer amount and connecting him to its star starry, as it is financed by a nation of rulers rich in Qatar oil.
The incomes are allowed to use large amounts of money for the acquisition of the players, but they must be balanced by real sources of income so that the business related to the football business is not profitable.
The economic rules for fair play were drawn up on the initiative of the French Michel Platin, elected President of UEFA in 2007.
As a former entrepreneur, Platini felt that the pursuit of success in terms of debt was cheating and led to serious problems if banks or owners were to withdraw their support.
In 2011, the main focus of fair play economic rules was shifted from the liabilities of the clubs to the performance of their losses.
The change meant that the implementation of the business model used by Roman Abramovich for the first time in Chelsea in 2003 was seriously affected. Abramovich bought a promising team, spent huge sums on player purchases and created a worldwide brand.
The current three-year assessment period of fair play economic rules will last until 2018, during which periods the clubs will be allowed to make a maximum of EUR 30 million loss.
Even though he was forced to abandon the mandate of the UEFA President in the scandalous way in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceffer, is also seeking to abuse the negligent spending of the clubs.
"The rules of fair play are still in use, and we will apply them in the future," Andrea Traverso, responsible for the economic rules of fair play in UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG ordered Neymar to be removed with a lump sum, it may calculate the amount of the amount in the accounts for the entire duration of his new contract.
Neymar has concluded a five-year agreement, so the amount of the transfer may be entered in the annual cost of EUR 44.4 million for the following five years.
On the basis of the economic rules of fair play, the first sanctions were imposed in 2014. The main sanctions were imposed on PSG and Abu Dhabi-funded City.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million, which was reduced to EUR 20 million later, and was also ordered to limit its Champions League group to 21 players for the period 2014-2015 instead of the 25 players in the ordinary period.
UEFA monitors groups that may try to circumvent its economic provisions to increase revenue through companies linked to its owners.
For example, if a polar firm supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be above the normal market level, UEFA will not count the aid as a real cost.
This was the case when UEFA decided in 2014 that the support for PSG from Qatar's tourist authority was over-represented.
It has also been shown that some of Neymar’s earnings in the PSG could be financed by the fees available from the MFCA of Qatar in 2022.
However, the PSG and the Central Commission have denied that it would be very easy for UEFA to reveal such an arrangement.
Due to previous sanctions by the PSG, UEFA will follow more generally companies around the rules than usual.
The sources present on Thursday reported that UEFA had not been consulted with PSG on the Neymar transfer.
The sources gave an interview to the Associated Press agency on condition that their identity is not revealed, as they do not have the power to discuss the situation with the PSG.
According to the most recent public accounts, PSG's turnover for the period 2015-2016 was EUR 542.4 million and its net profit exceeds EUR 10 million.
The daily financial statements have not yet been made public.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to attract new sponsors and increase the sales of related products and toys.
The follow-up estimates that its turnover will increase by at least 30 % following the Neymar agreement.
The Spanish too, which is clearly agitated from the departure of the world's best player, was trying to hinder Neymar's transfer, which was claimed to be a violation of the fair game's economic rules.
"This is a clear case of economic doping, both in the case of the Society and in the case of the State," said Javier Tebas, President of the Spanish League, to the Spanish newspaper AS.
Arsenal's manager, Arsene Wenger, also has reservations about the state funding of the football club's activities. Arsenal owns an American sports shop.
"The outcome is the result of a ownership that has completely changed the operating environment of the FFA in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"All is possible after the state owns the football team.
It will be very difficult to comply with fair play economic rules. There are so many interests involved in the fact that a famous player represents the State.”
We are in a hurry: the coach of Finnish MM athletes is stuck in Helsinki.
Long-term jumpers Arttu Pajulahti and tributary Kristiina Mäkelä coach Suren Ghazaryan is stuck in Helsinki, even if he should train public sport in the World Cups in London.
As Kristi Mäkel, you may have to compete without the advice of your coach.
The Pajulahti will compete tomorrow on the short-climbing and the Mäkelä on Saturday on the triple-climbing.
However, two coachs, Armenian Ghazaryan, have not received a visa for the United Kingdom.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the matter without the results of the British Embassy.
The coach has a call from the World Cup organisers as a document, but this has not been enough to obtain a visa either.
I wonder if this is one of the first symptoms of Brexit, isn't it, Coach Jorma Kemppainen said.
He's always been successful in dealing with the issues himself, but now there's something wrong with him.
He's doing everything he can to get there.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finnish Sports Union SUL for years.
It's not that important.
As long as someone at the stadium looks at the points, Artu Pajuhlahti told his coach about any absence from the stadium.
MM-Mital for Finland The London requires a miracle.
The World Sports Championships will start in London today on Friday and will last a fair week on Sunday, 13 August.
Sports, cross-country skiing and hockey are the species to which Finnish bench athletes are able to react passionately from one year to another, whether they are successful or not.
In the hearts of park athletes, success is measured in medals.
Of course there's more to it.
The beautiful crop stories of young athletes about value prices to another are less ignored, where, by gaining experience, the performance of an athlete is matured to the extent that the MM medal for adults is truly possible.
Now Finland's little MM team doesn't have such young athletes, and yet neither do you.
MM-mital Finland requires a miracle.
The attractive and surprisingness of sport is that miracles can happen.
It drags the bench athletes to the television screen and glues to follow the competitions, even though London's medals are solved due to the time difference only late in the evening.
Among the previous World Cups for Sport in 2015 Finland received one bronze medal.
Brings it to the spear-thrower Tero Rähämäki.
The faithful look forward to the long term even now, while the other ones tell us the results of his recent years and the other players, as well as the remaining of the long term at the prices of last summer's value.
Whatever you do in these competitions, the Pitäki will remain in history as a great Finnish sports hero.
Other Finnish athletes at the competitions will have access to the final competition or self-recording is a sufficiently good performance.
Hope and faith in the realistic mitali hunts of Finnish general sport in the coming years will bring good success in the international values of young people this summer as well.
The processing of young talent and the economic support of its work is more important than maintaining a small elite population of representative athletes.
Loss will not be immediate but will require years of sweaty work for athletes and patience, both in training and in bench athletes.
Finns can also appreciate international sports stars and enjoy their unique performances.
London’s competitions will remain in the history of Usai Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of terror or cowardly attacks.
Eni Rukajärvi in second Copper Big Air - "But I'm sorry"
Enni Rukajärvi, a snow carrier, is ranked second in the Big Air race in the USA Colorade.
The second player that arrived at the Copper Mountain is the best big air in the world of Rukajärvi.
Women's race won by the United States of America's Anderson.
Rukajärvi collected 147 points in the competition.
On his last jump, he tried caballerel 1080 for the first time in the games, and it was very close to success.
I feel good and a good girl is good now, but I'm sorry that the last jump didn't go right.
From now on, I'm going to try again and again, Tuumi Rukajärvi.
In the big air of snowboarding, the competitor jumps from the jumper made for the race.
Viking Line's new fast-to-air new stormed into the port of Helsinki in Helsinki.
The new fleet FSTR, which is the new high-speed fleet of Viking, is very late from time to time.
The express ship had to leave Helsinki, Tallinn, at 6: 00 a.m., from Helsinki to Tallinn.
There were eight countries where loading was being carried out.
The ship came to Helsinki already late.
For at least a half an hour, I've been waiting for you to get on board.
The car line now moves a little, the Estonian, who is waiting to enter the ship in the port of Helsinki, Johannes Rebane, told at 7.30 p.m.
Rebane thought there had been a mistake on the new ship.
Rebane told us that the shipping company had brought water bottles to the ship waiting for access to its cars.
Viking Communications Manager Christa Grönlund tells IS that there is a mistake.
It was repaired in the port of Helsinki.
The ship leaves Helsinki a few hours late.
Jönlund says that the ship will also be late for a couple of hours from the trip to Tallinn.
The ship had to leave Tallinn to return to Helsinki at 2:15 p.m.
A 42-metre special transport will disrupt traffic on 6th Thursday nights.
42 m long special transport from the Muusto to the Port of Mustola during Thursday night.
The transport from 9 a.m. should be in place by midnight.
Control traffic in the Sixth Method and traffic may be stopped from time to time.
The transport from Mälki to Mälki is moving 13 along the port of Mustola.
Viennese kören nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrate Detective
At the same time, the story swept away both the days of the 80's spell and the 90's grunge of characters (the days of David Wain and Michael Showalter were the brightest of the State series for MTV) and their own time — 2001 — before the Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and the other stars of the series moved on to bigger things in their career.
As a organic product, it is both a parod and a description of the continuous memory that we have stuck in for the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it is already alive.
First Day of Camp worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (including the background story of H. Jon's voice speaking vegetable can).
The focus of the discussion is that middle-aged actors are acting as a part of the impossibility of achieving the past.
Ten Years Later, where adults act like adults, is less emotional, and its parody is more fragmented: for example, it parodys 90's-century skating movies, such as the horror movie The Hand, who rockes the body.
In one point, one of the characters digs up Apple - Book, inline roller skaters and "other stuff in 1991."
Many stories are the same as before.
Good-hearted Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but is still not over Katie (Marguerite More).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
There is also a crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (including Michael Showalter) as a criminal partner in George H. W. Bush (which is well-behaved by Michael Ian Black).
As always in this series, the best are the side paths.
It's especially fun to see the ancient young Paul Rudd, who has a beardup, or Matt Dillon, from the "soul patch" movie of Singles. Rudd's acting Andy, the camp's shoe, is starting to be an old man.
The moments of random madness may bring this series to flight as a kind of recursive Seven Up! series, until it gets its obvious decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. In its last scene, a friend goes to the Wet Hot American Summer film on his first night of the Wet Hot American Summer film.
The Amazon Come Detective series refers to another kind of nostalgia: The Americans series’s cold breath, the Atomic Blode film, and even the GLOW series’s buttonshot, where it meets the west.
The comedy series has been created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and has been directed by Rhys Thomas. It is made into a Romanian 1980s police drama in which a Bucharist cop fights for truth, atheism and Marxism.
In the main Iosefina, the protagonist and idealist Iosefina, we can see Flor's Piers Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their sequences have been doubled in English by Channing Tatum (main producer of the series) and Edmonton-Levitt.
That's a great idea,
but that's all it is.
There are some good visual jokes in the series (the police take time to watch TV chess the way the Americans watch football).
There are a number of famous voice actors, including Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahersala Ali and Chloë Sevigny. Their bonging is a fun game.
Comrate Detective, however, is too caught up in tracking the socialist drama of the clumsy – a killer hiding behind Reagan's mask, for example, and that's why it's often starting to sound like a real clumsy propaganda.
Six long periods are too long, and the humor of the series is not fast enough or rich.
A consolidated series could work better as an agit pro-sairor, perhaps when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy and the lobby, there are always two fat men in the crowd of hamburgers in the box and in the lobby.
The message to the pictured Communist public is that the Western culture can make all consumer goods and fast food.
The illustrative Romanian creators of the series were not wrong: our covetously our immediate history and their history, too, were not wrong.
Kou Volanan Toni Tauru will rise on Saturday in the ring in Macao - against a former UFC opponent.
Toni Tauru wants to keep the fight standing.
Toni Tauru is facing a hard bone in Macao, for the Brazilian Leandro Issa fought last year at the UFC.
The Romanians also have a jujutsu belt and the race's World Cup.
For once, I'm going to fight against my parents.
That's funny, she's 32-year-old Tauru telling me.
The couvolian had to get into the ring in Indonesia last Saturday.
The action was cancelled due to logistical problems, but three struggles were made on a short-term basis to the Chinese Autonomous Community of Macao.
This is not what has happened before.
This was the first time my match was canceled.
It was annoying, because preparation and training took a long time.
However, the fighter is pleased that a new time has come for the struggle.
The trial of the week does not have much to do with preparation.
The transfer is not going to work out, because it won't work out in a week.
Well, it can get even worse if you're working too hard now.
In a few previous struggles, Tauru has encountered opponents whose strengths are in the process of performing.
This time, the situation is different.
Issa kouvolian describes her as a typical Brazilian.
He's a pretty aggressive fighter.
I bet he gets on hard in the first round and tries to take the carpet.
He's won the jug of the world, so he knows how to go.
The last Kouvolian match did not go as planned.
The Philippinesman, Kevin Belingon, hit Taur badly in the eye, and the victory stayed in the Philippines.
I've never been so far ahead of him: he didn't get any hits.
When I left for the crash, he hit me in the eye.
It really bothered me for a very long time.
Stunning motivation.
Some freelancers pick up once a year, some rise more often in the ring.
For example, the future opponent Issa was living for the last time in September.
There were three matches last year in turn.
This is the second struggle of the year ahead.
Sometimes someone has become pregnant.
In recent years, I've been working out and I've been good at it all the time.
However, I have only been fighting for fighting.
When 32 years old heard of a future encounter, he decided to change the landscape for a moment.
I was training in Espoo and I got the pleasure back.
We got really good training when there was a guy in Sweden, too.
The training was a great help, for on Saturday, the Kouvolian will have to prepare for a physical struggle.
I have been allowed to train against opponents of the same size and practice the final match.
Fighting well is a 32-year-old main tactics.
You got to hit it real good.
If it's possible, I'm going to take the land myself, of course.
They must not be given for free, as they consume the most.
Macao attracts the Tauru, which has been fought in China in the past.
I'm afraid it's in the West of China. It's in Las Vegas.
I think there's a big and nice edge ahead.
The central bank shall keep interest rates at 0.25 %.
The central bank is expected to report that it will keep interest rates unchanged when economic growth has been untangled and inflation reduction has stopped speculation on interest payments.
The central bank has informed the central bank that economic growth will continue to slow down. The bank transferred interest payments because more pressure is on the family’s income level.
The decision-makers of the Central Bank’s Monetary Commission decided to hold interest rates of 0.25% on 6 to 2 votes, and the interest-bearing company received even less support this month because economic growth has been unfocused.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank decreased its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its forecast for 2018 to 1.6%; it also warned that more pressure would be exerted on households' income, as inflation is expected to continue to increase by close to 3% in the autumn.
However, according to the bank, interest-rate purchases will be required in the coming years to control the inflation that Brext has accelerated, and the bank also announced that the cost of the loan could have to be increased more than expected on the financial market.
In addition, the members of the Board decided to withdraw part of the massive economic package which began to take place one year ago in the wake of the Brexit referendum.
The Bank will close the Term Funding Scheme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide low-cost financing to banks through the programme at a rate of GBP 15 million more, i.e. a total of GBP 115 million.
The protocol on the bank's interest rate report states: "According to the forecast of the Commission responsible for monetary policy, the slow development of GDP will continue in the coming years as the fall in real income of households will reduce consumption."
With regard to interest rates, the bank reiterated that inflation control requires "some degree of monetary policy tightening" the market's expectations of "a little wider".
The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any remuneration would be "several" and "marginal".
In May, the bank predicted an increase of 1.9% for this year and a growth of 1.7% for next year.
It now held its growth forecast for 2018 at 1.8%.
As a result of the news, the nuance of the dollar and the euro was made in connection with the news.
In relation to the dollar, the pound weakened by 0.5 per cent and was $1.31. In relation to the euro, it declined by 0.4 per cent and stood at 1,11 per cent.
The decision to keep interest rates unchanged was made following the decline in the expected lower growth rates from interest income. GDP grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter and by 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.
The bank expects growth to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter but to rise slightly at the end of the year.
Its latest inflation review gave little hope for rising inflation and low wage increases for households, and according to the bank, the situation will get worse before it gets better.
The bank added that monetary policy "can't prevent" revenue from falling over the next few years, but it expects the wage-setting to take place at the end of the three-year forecast period.
The economy will also be strengthened by strong growth in demand for British products as a result of weak pounds, which will reverse part of the impact of the fall in private consumption.
The decision was made a year after the interest rate fell to 0,25 % after the result of the EU national vote, which was triggered by a drop in pounds, which was due to shock.
The bank estimates that the overall impact of the decision is likely to be visible in prices and the economy only after four years.
Before the latest decision of the central bank, interest payments had begun to be demanded more and more by the inflation exerting pressure on households.
Last month inflation slowed down by 2.6 per cent from 2.9% in June, but according to the bank, it was expected and inflation will tighten again in the coming months.
According to the bank, its overrun of the 2% target level was due to a "total" weakness.
"In view of the recent decline in swap interest rates, competition in the mortgage market seems to be tightening further when lenders are looking for customers and want to end a year hard", says Coreco Mortgage Brokers Director, iPad Montlake.
"Marks look particularly good for those whose current agreement is coming to an end. The new agreements are more popular, their interest rates are low and there are also cost-effective alternatives."
The number of NHS is 10,000 for a controversial anti-HIV medicine.
As of September, patients may be prescribed a "reversible" anti-HIV medicine. The Supreme Court concluded a dispute concerning the financing of the medicine in the public health system (NHS).
The NHS indicated that the pre-exposure (PrEP) treatment is to be given to approximately 10,000 people during the first three-year trial. It has been shown that the medicinal product taken before it has been used to reduce the risk of infection by approximately 86% for individuals at risk.
The NHS agreed to finance the experiment after the court held the Supreme Court judgment last year, according to which NHS could pay the PREF, even though it claims that the local authorities should finance it.
Simon Stevens, Director of the NHS, called the decision announced on Thursday "a major new action", and the NAO described it as "a crucial moment to solve it".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Oceania, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to accept registrations for an experiment that will be extended in October to other clinics. Try to reach its full range in England by April 2018.
Anti-exposure therapy (PREP) must be taken prior to co-administering an anti-HIV medicine that decreases the risk of infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP contributes significantly to HIV infection and risk groups.
The preventive medicinal product means that during the course of the interaction, there are sufficient substances in the body to prevent HIV infection.
You can take this medicine daily or two hours before you have sex.
The target group of treatment consists of gays, bisexual men and transgenders, as well as people with HIV-positive partners who cannot receive effective treatment.
The clinics select the conditions for the experiment to meet the criteria of the applicants for men, women and trans-gender and for those whose HIV-positive partner is not known to have an antiretroviral treatment for their disease.
People living in England and reporting to a general doctor may also apply for an experiment at their local sexual health clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million and this year the NHS signed a contract for medicinal products after an international tender.
The purpose of the experiment is to assess the potential of the PrEP medicinal product by collecting extensive clinical evidence of its relevance, intake and administration.
"This major new intervention should complement and enhance existing and better-functioning tools for HIV", says Stevens.
"This is another major achievement in the fight that has been going on for more than 30 years in order to solve the major health challenge of mankind."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says Deborah Gold, director of the National AIDS Organization.
"If PrEP is correctly targeted at those who need it and those who belong to risk groups, it may have a reversive effect on their HIV epidemics.
From September onwards, the risk group will receive an experiment funded by NHS with a medicinal product for which they can decide independently without the need to negotiate with a partner, which will have an effective effect that will improve the lives of very many people.
This was welcome news."
"It is now important to ensure that the experiment is launched quickly throughout the country and that no one in the risk group falls outside it," says Terrence Higgins Foundation Director Ian Green.
"PrEP for experimental use has been acquired and we will soon be able to protect ten thousand people in risk groups from HIV infection."
"The start of the PrEP trial is a welcome event that was extended for a number of months in vain because of the government's slowdown", says Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health of the Controversy Board.
"We have evidence that the medicine may have a reversible effect on our work that we are doing to prevent HIV and stop the spread of this dangerous disease.
The experiment will help us to understand better the real benefits of the PrEP medicinal product.
It is now important that the experiment is launched as soon as possible throughout the country, thus protecting the HIV exposed and getting closer to the point where the spread of HIV in society has been successfully stopped."
Quality of living: intermediate and smart interiors solutions have made a spacious home from a small apartment in Earl's Court.
A former banker, Joanne Ligh, who was inspired by the renovation of properties, moved from Knightsbridge to a smaller dwelling in Earl's Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of the House of Queen Anna's period style, and the success of the renovation tells us that Joanne has not yet packed up her efforts and changed her life.
"This is before I lived with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger home," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something similar in my price class.
I visited this apartment building, and I noticed that the rooms were as tall as my apartment.
"I fell in love immediately and made an offer on the same day."
Since then, about 90-square-square-square dwellings have experienced a complete transformation of shape.
It was a twin in which the bedroom only got out of the kitchen. Joanne wanted more storage space and an intermediate floor so that the room height could be used.
"I wanted space, big windows and lots of light.
They were my demands," he says.
He hired Erfan Azad to work at the Duck & Shed Planning Agency in Notting Hollywood, and Erfan was tasked to use the space of nearly four meters tall rooms and to create an apartment that would not only be a repair and sale destination but also a home.
The height of the room was not enough for two overlapping conditions, so the challenge was to build a spaced floor where there was a stopover.
The solution required Erfan to have a creative mindset.
"The steel structures are quite complex.
The facilities had to be organised at the same time so that there was no need to plaice in them.
Buildings had to be adapted so that the height was just right on and below them."
Erfan was able to place two full height rooms at the same time with fascinating details.
On the interlayer, the copper-related window of Retrouvius opens up an elegant space of rest.
The mirrored furniture, silver effects and Serge Mouille's vintage lamps create a distinctive style.
The use of mirrors brings theatricality, the feeling and light of the state.
The mirrors on both sides of the short corridor get a view of the passage further than ever before.
The mirror in the kitchen space is like a window with a view to another room.
There is storage room for Joanne’s meals and glassware in the mirrored furniture of the entrance.
The fact that the kitchen can be hidden when it is not used increases the style of the kitchen.
The kitchens fitted with a winch door are not a new solution,
But the unique thing about Joanne's kitchen is that the door is lifted up in the same way as the garage door.
"It took a bit of planning", Erfan says about the steel-backed MDF door.
"It is balanced, so it slides very easily when raised."
With the sound state of operation and storage planning, Joanne received 16 extra squares, the second bedroom and a better base for the better.
"When selling the property, the surface area will decide – or the valuation of the property," says Erfan.
"In the case of a base case, the real estate agent enters the apartment and calculates the price on the basis of the surface area."
In Joanne's dwelling, the area was increased by the use of high-quality materials that bring the space to the general public.
"The sock is in contact with the property of the dwelling, and the emotional connection to the dwelling is partly based on them", says Erfan.
"No one is attached to electricity currents in walls.
They too are important but not in the same way."
Joanne's apartment is an example of the fact that good planning and additional living conditions can make the dwelling extraordinarily fine.
Then it can also happen that you don't want to move out of the apartment anymore.
The baby princess Sofia, who was pregnant, waved in her summer cane.
Princess Sofia's residence was hit by a button.
Princess Sofia was last represented in Båstad in Sweden for the last time before she was born.
The princess had chosen a light blue dress for the evening of the Astainable Myorre event.
Sofia represented on the occasion as a smiler.
The Swedish princess Sofia has visited Båstad in Sweden this week.
On Wednesday afternoon, Sofia was represented at the A Sustainable Toorre seminar in a beautiful, beautiful, body-to-be fashioned costume that was a wonderfully dressed princess last time she was pregnant.
Sofia arrived at the event in the darkest population.
This is the last event of representation in which Sofia will be represented before she is born.
The calculation of time is in September.
For the event’s event, Sofia had chosen a beautiful pastel blue dress that landed beautifully.
The style was crowned by large earrings and a stylish little bag.
The superstitious dress was very good for the princess.
Sofia has been on a mission trip to Båstad in Sweden this week.
Sofia was all over the place with a little girl.
Sofia, in effect, evaporated in her fresh summer cane.
Sofia became inspired by the event, even to talk to photographers.
Now I'm just holding on to my stomach, Sofia found out the laugh and referred to her for the rest of her life.
He's bringing us up with a sweet chil.
In the summer of 1996, a home appeared at the Lahti Square where food from Denmark was sold.
The Lahti people were not afraid to land, but walked past.
In the home, the food was sold by Pany Suamsri-Penttila, familiar in the middle of Panja.
He did not know much about Finnish, and the Finns did not know about Thai at that time.
Because people were afraid to go to dinner, Panja offered free corn.
He thus taught the Lahti to eat thar food, ready to fly at a time.
From the taste of the land, he said.
I got caught in a hook from the box.
I was more and more frequent, eventually every day.
In the summer of 1997, Panja opened her food business in the Lahti Chamber.
There were two small tables, so I guess there were less than 20 destinations.
He taught us not only to eat tari food, but also to sit next to a stranger.
When there is a limited hunger and a limited space, you cannot leave an empty chair between yourself and a stranger.
We got to know each other better, and we became friends.
Finally, I sat over a plate with a dictionary to study the Thai language.
Two years went to the mall, but then the restaurant had to move because the self-made spices said that they would search too much in the hall.
A new place was released at the end of the mall.
There's space there.
Now we jurors are allowed to sit in our own tables again, just in a later period of time, we must shyly ask our guests if there is room for room.
Panja knows her senses.
He's been told what happened and who's been seen.
He knows what food each eats.
He's seen how the lives of customers vary and the food changes.
He remembers the name of the man I went to eat my first soup.
He remembers me as thin and fat and remembers how I was young.
It's nice to go to lunch a little later than the others, sit in my seat next to the kitchen door and change your hearings with Panja, who leans in the counter.
Food is not the most important thing we get from him.
He has taught tolerance and internationalism with a sweet chili dish.
In addition to our senses, he has opened up our senses and hearts.
Today many people talk to him Thai - thank you for the increased popularity of tourism.
I'm sorry about Panja.
Even though she's been difficult, she's always kind.
He's busy.
He's going to go to the restaurant and he's going to be in a hurry and he's going to the blacks.
Last week in the event of the event, there was a slight celebration of the completion of two decades.
We customers got strawberry cake for dessert by dessert.
This important day, the day of work, took an alarm or attention to the weather.
The discovery of underground support revealed 173 Isis terrorists who were ready to strike Europe.
From the beginning of the year, security authorities have received a significant list for anti-terrorist work.
The list contains more than 170 data from Isis fighters who are ready to attack Europe.
According to the German newspaper Die Welt, there are 173 persons in total and the document also includes pictures of each individual in addition to their personal data.
Of the persons mentioned in the list, more than 130 are Iraqi, but there are also six persons involved.
They come from Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany.
The others are from Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Tazdhikistan and Saudi Arabia.
Evening Sanomat told me about the watch and a couple of weeks back.
The location of the list and its contents have now been revised.
According to the magazine, the Iraqi Army Special Forces created a list of terrorist's personal data and images in an investigation into the U.S. U.A.'s underground base in Mosul.
The U.S. D.A. evaluated the authenticity of the papers and sent them to Interpol.
The list was distributed by Interpol to all European security authorities in May.
The background was a fear that something big and serious would be planned in the Western countries by terrorists in the fall of Isis in the Middle East.
According to Die Welt, the list includes, in addition to the names and images of all persons, their date of birth, the details of their inventions, and information on the home country of the person.
The list also includes a list of terrorist specialities.
The listed German 27-year-old Sami J. is named Abu Assid al-Almani, German.
He is reported to have left Germany in 2012 traveling first to Egypt, then to Libya and later to Syria to join Isis.
A special suicide bomber has been written next to his picture.
There is no more detailed information on the fate of the husband.
There have been a total of about 6 000 fighters leaving Europe in Isis, whose fate is uncertain.
There was a fall under the surface in the Tokoinranta of Helsinki, Tokoinranta.
Based on the interviews at the rescue facility, the man had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
Even a bucket can save a life of death.
On Thursday, a person under water was rescued in the Tokoinranta.
According to the firefighter Ville Estlander, the firefighter of the rescue service, the situation was over quickly.
The person was found under water about 15 minutes after the announcement.
The rescuer found him under the skin, Estlander says.
The rescue facility received a notification half a month after 4 p.m.
The person was transferred to the first-hand care centre.
Estlander is talking about a man of about 50 years old.
On the basis of interviews, the husband had wanted to show that he was able to swim.
The situation in Tokoinranta is already over.
Estlander welcomes official cooperation with the Border Guard and the police.
This was the responsibility of the Director of the Border Guard.
The locals also guided the divers very well.
The situation was over in 15 minutes.
The man was rescued from the water together with the Border Guard and the police.
Two passenger cars hit nine people in Eura - in cars, three were seriously injured.
There were nine people in the cars, the rest of whom suffered minor injuries, reports the sun-head fireman.
Among the injured are both men and women.
The accident occurred in a three-way contour at four o'clock in the morning.
An accident occurred when another car turned behind the word triangle in front of another car, says the star friend fireman.
According to the rescue facility, the cruise area has an hour-limit of 80 km/h.
The brothers are fighting for more than $500 million in real estate.
Two brothers are arguing about Victoria's biggest property estates worth more than $500 million, which are related to their Italian family business, established 40 years ago by the Italian family company.
Former president of the Carlton football club and real estate developer Colin De Lutis lives only three houses from Paul, his younger brother. The younger brother has taken the highest division of property and business between the brothers in the dispute.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but there is a bitter dispute about the divorce.
The brothers and their mother, Anna, together own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, and the family began to acquire property when they bought a trade on the Collingwood Smith Street in 1973.
The family established a Westco Jeans store in the village, which expanded to 160 stores.
The sales of the market were sold for $85 million in 1999.
The money was used for real estate, and the family now owns offices, real estate development areas in Brunswick and Sorrento, and housing in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in suburbs.
According to the agreement with the late father, Colin owns about two thirds and Paul about one third of the company's assets. Paul describes his father as "the bearing force of the family and the central character".
According to the laws of law, the ownership ratio of assets means that Colin owns properties worth about $316 million and Paul's value of about $176 million.
Paul is not happy with the distribution of properties and money.
"I think Colin left the best properties for himself in his proposal," Paul wrote in his first sworn testimony to the court in 2015.
The case was dealt with last Friday for the first time in the Supreme Court after several mediations.
The brothers are now also arguing about who controls the existing business. Paul claims that Colin has excluded him from the business.
Colin claims that the claim is not true, and he blames Paul for the poor management of some of the properties.
Colin writes in one of his first sworn statements that he would like to reach a conclusion on the matter.
"In accordance with our Italian traditions, the family is my most important thing", Colin says in her opinion.
There are hundreds of pages of voluntary statements, e-mails and reports that are being discussed by consultants such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers in the country, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who set up dairy bars and petacles in the late 1950s. In the early 1970s, they bought a trade at Brunswick.
They were used as collateral for the purchase of a property at Collingwood where Colin founded the first farm sale of the family.
Colin tells us that he has established a trade "in the last years of reading, while Paul was still a child (about 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis tells us that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to transfer properties to their boys in agreement.
"Luigi often stated that he did not want the brothers to end up in court," let him write in his statement.
Two other sons of the family, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the business of the De Lutis Group. According to Colin, Mark received $10 million and Luke $26 million when leaving the company.
Paul says that he and Mark are "a breach of the economic conditions of their departure.
Colin has held a low profile, although he has been a former member of the Board of the Australian Fleet League and a best friend of Eddie McGuire's this year in 2015 according to the biography of this year.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on a Friday.
Colin only replied, and she told me in a text message that you can't really comment on it because it's being dealt with in court.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family by the name of a court-martial," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to comply with his brother’s demands.
"Our father would not have wanted us to argue like this," Colin continued and told us that he would continue to wish that a solution would be reached.
On Friday, the hope seemed to have passed out.
"Our business will be settled in court in the near future," wrote Colin.
The ultimate new staff manager intends to select the President's media use.
Others have tried and failed.
Perhaps John F.pe will finally succeed.
First.
According to Poltico, the new head of staff of the White House intends to monitor the media and news of President Trump so as not to be in trouble so often.
Editor Josh Dawsey reports:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with the board of directors on his first working day, he addressed the main problem he intends to resolve: he intends to restrict access to information by President Donald Trump.
Kelly told the employees of the White House that all information, whether printed or heard in the media, must pass through her because the President makes better decisions when getting good information."
The line is logical, but others have also tried to limit the use of the Truth and failed.
President Trump has the relationship of decades with television – and as President he continues to watch a lot of television.
"If the presidential candidate Trump was nervous about unfair news, it was good for him to show that he was more in agreement with the media", Sam Nunberg, who worked as a consultant at the Trump campaign, told Politico newspaper in February.
Politician Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "The control of the use of Trump Twitter by six former campaign workers is essential that his personal media stream is a constant stream of praise.
Okay.
But it is ridiculous to say that the use of the Truth Twitter would never have been controlled.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something we don't know – perhaps the Right twitters would have been even more powerful without their efforts.
We will probably never know what messages Trump sent out.
If his staff has been able to prevent problems caused by him even more than once, their work has not been in vain.
However, no one has consistently been able to prevent the Court of Justice from causing it to trial.
The problem is partly due to the fact that there are competing groups in the White House who are trying to run their case by providing information that supports their minds, which can be reliable – or not.
In May, Politico wrote that the advisors deliberately provide the President with questionable information.
Editor Shane Goldmacher told me about a case:
"The current and former employees of the trump say that he can become so mad at the magazines where he is judged – especially if they tell about harmful data leaks, so he needs to know where the data came from.
It happened at the end of February, when someone viciously gave the President a copy of the GotNews.com website, which was founded by Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Staff Manager Katie Walshi of a number of White House data leaks.
Mr. Johnson had been permanently removed from the file for harassment, and he had previously spread false accusations and withdrawn them later, and he also did not provide any concrete evidence.
Despite this, Trump had started the case after reading the story after asking about the staff in Walsh."
Goldmacher added that at that time, Reince Priebus, Chief of Staff and Rob Porter, Secretary of Staff of the White House, " had attempted to establish a system of management of the systems going to the Trump.
And what was the result?
Kelly will try to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still his own impulsive self and his assistants continue to pursue their own interests.
These unaltered facts make the task very difficult.
Neymar concluded a five-year contract with PSG for a period of five years.
President Neymar has concluded a five-year contract with the French FOFF Society's PSG, reports AFP.
Earlier on Thursday evening, it was reported that Neymar’s representatives had paid FC Barcelona FC in Spain’s league a purchase price of EUR 222 million.
The Neymar agreement with Barcelona had therefore been terminated and was therefore free to move to a partner's party's PSG.
The maximum amount of EUR 222 million is the largest in the history of the country.
The last record was on the United States, which last summer was EUR 105 million from French Paul Pogba.
PSG is owned by Qatar Sports Investment, a state-owned gladiary company.
The successor shall be chaired by a former Tesammatist, a Qatari Nasser al-Khelaifi, former Tesammatist.
Neymar is believed to be arriving in Paris on Friday.
A successful author, Rajija Oranen, in the hypnosis of alcoholism and the fear of aviation, wrote: "I am in my life's condition".
Tv-stars Rusu time and Clean white sheets of famous success writer Rajja Oranen have just spent his 69th anniversary.
The hypnosis helped Raija Ora.
Five grandkids keep the ladies so close to writing that Rajja and Jyrki, his husband, gave up Spain’s sun and Fuengirola’s home after 18 winter.
At first they sold their house, but now in the spring they also left the rental dwelling.
The light and the sun, out of the old circles, Raijan took on the recent depression and alcoholism from which he has survived.
Even the external nature is 20 kilos lighter.
The pressure went down when the serotonin medication was stopped, they were drugs for the mood.
Alcoholism helped me with some of the old hypnosis, which also worked on flying fear, I won it.
I've been without alcohol for 15 years now.
Alcohol is a person who is an open talker of alcohol, a radiating writer.
Rajja and Jyrki Oranen have been on the same journey for more than 45 years.
I feel better than ever.
Jyrki Oranen has been working together for more than 40 years for the raja and the industry.
I proposed, and it was marriage for two weeks, Rajja laughing.
He's always been the queen of such a drama, ending his life with that, Jyrki laughing at his wife.
A major literary career by Orane made only good on 44 parts of pure white sheets on the TV series, which touched and moved Finland in the recession period.
I finally decided to become a company of the Raikas family in the clothing industry when I read the 50th anniversary of Liisa Seppälä on the plane.
I was the daughter of a sewing machine myself, my mother also had a clothing store, and I sometimes act as a mannequin, orane remembers.
He said that the plot and story of a series changed the attitude of Finns towards entrepreneurship.
Anita Saveinen's research and reasoning revealed, says Oranen.
Rajja Oranen lives as an author of active time, he has many manuscripts working under - ideas for hundreds of years.
The cyclists returned over the barley "to the alley of millions of millions".
The wealthiest owners in West Midlands are once again wearing hair clothes with underprivileged tourists who managed to cross the town's search and return to the next field of the houses.
The cyclists parked a couple of rentals near a street called the millions of alleys in Solihull, near the streets of Solihull.
They were driven out of the area in May, but they managed to cross the city's doorway to prevent them from passing, and they brought with them children, horses and an army of vans.
The cyclists managed to cross the exit at a point that had been left unprotected because of the path.
Raised residents have accused Solihull's municipality of "complete inability to solve the problem.
An anonymous resident reports that tourists have come on Monday night from Bentley Heath, where they had thrown passersby on the rocks.
"It must be hard to act because it seems to be fully capable of solving the problem.
The cyclists were here in May, then they left, and then they came back again.
They're coming in later and probably even more today."
The resident reported that the municipality of Birmingham had solved the problem by denying access to the parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it is frustrating to pay municipal tax when the municipality is unable to do anything about it."
According to another anonymous resident, it is ridiculous that the aliens returned as soon as they were driven away.
"There are more of them than ever, and they've even counted a horse to sow in the park."
According to the informant of the Telehull municipality, the municipality is aware of illegal camping in the vicinity of Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with Solihull Police to stop camping as soon as possible.
In order to gather evidence, it is essential that as many locals as possible report to the police a disturbing or criminal activity.
It will help to shape a picture of the situation for trial."
The raved people surrounded Portugal's decomposing machine.
In Portugal, men who have made an arrest on a beach full of people have been questioned today in court.
As a result of the exile, two people died yesterday.
Two men on board ships may be charged with the death penalty.
At most, it can obtain 16 years of imprisonment in Portugal.
A small plane flying by men was forced to make yesterday's technical flaw by a forced landing near Sao Joao da Coppera, near Lisbon.
There were hundreds of people on the beach during the time of the event, some of whom ran the landing plane into the water.
The plane hit a 56-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl who died immediately when she landed.
The plane first hit a man on the back of the plane.
Immediately thereafter, the machine rose up and, when it landed again, it hit the child’s head, told the newspaper Phillipe Janera Joonal de Noticias on the beach.
The little girl who died was at the beach with her parents.
Her parents didn't get hurt.
The people on the beach surrounded the small machine immediately after the storm, angry at them.
The daughter's father and other people went to the machine and started beating it up, reported the case in the newspaper Celia Rocha Correio da Manha.
He called the pilot a criminal, he was desperate.
It is a wonder that no more people are killed.
Two men on a plane did not get hurt in the crash.
The Finnish minister, who lost his leg tragically, once again won the World Cup: "Without disaster I would not be the world's world".
Matti Suur-Hamari served early Wednesday morning in Finland during the competition held in the big Canadian competition in the World Trade Center.
In the past, Big Hamari also won the Cross’s MM gold in the competitions.
There are already three MM-telephonys in total.
That's incredible MM-games.
Two times the gold was treated, with a pretty good pulse drawn, the called Big Hamari was pleased.
The 30-year-old layer thanked his coach and well-managed preparation in Finland.
According to the Great Hamar, the number of candidates in the region is increasing all the time.
The entire paraluminary fleet has grown and developed a lot recently.
The differences are decreasing and there are many new hedges involved.
Always wondering if a black horse is coming behind you.
Each race seems to have a different winner.
Suur-Hamari lost his second leg in a motorcycle accident in 2009.
He had been eager to count with his friends since he was young, and the accident did not want to get out of the way.
It comes to mind at times what my life would be like without that accident.
But my attitude has always been that it's okay if it's got you.
With the cards that have been distributed, the Big Hamari points out.
It would be a truth to match the serious accident and the loss of the limb into a lucky kick, and Big Hamari doesn't do that either.
But he turned to a terrible difficulty.
I would say, yes, the situation turned out to be a success.
I wouldn't be a triple world without an accident.
In the absence of an accident, the largest take-off of the 23-year-old Suur-Hamar was already falling apart.
After the accident, probably not until the end of the flood, the peak went off to take place.
I used to work out when I was young with my friends, and we used to kill X-Games all the time.
But they were distant wounds that dim over time.
After the accident, I found myself somewhere in the X-Games.
I couldn't have imagined it before.
I was 23 years old and I thought this would be a very long life if I stayed here to disappoint and grieve.
I decided to pull the hangers in the neck and get to work.
I'm saying I've done quite well.
The waiter became a very wide-ranging player from the selection of Leo-Pekka Star for a year's sportsman.
The fourth Olympic winner was awarded his prize in a sports event in January.
The great Hamar says that the victory of the star is an important signal for para-sports.
It was a really big deal, and the victory was definitely deserved.
This will certainly also open your eyes to the world of para-sports.
When will it be time to launch a two-time world-class Matti Nagy-Hamar annual sports campaign?
See you in time.
I'm trying to do my best to succeed.
Great Hamar has not taken over all the peaks he desires.
Next year, a major target will be set next year.
After a year, Paralympics will be held in South Korea.
Let's go get a medal.
A majority of Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently unless the war ends and Isis leaves the country.
A Voice for Young Syrian Recovery study examined the opinions and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
Syrian refugees are cooking bread in refugee camps in Jordan.
The majority of Syrian young people do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently.
According to them, the end of the Syrian war and the departure of Isis from the country are the most important things that should happen so that they can return to their country of origin.
The regime does not see a change in the Syrian conflict as a result of the regime.
The Communications Office, the Bison-Marsteller, discussed the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees in international research.
Mr Burson-Marsteller has already studied the opinions and attitudes of the Arabs in nine years.
This year's study A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees examined the views and attitudes of young Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Lebanon.
The survey was conducted in February-March 2017 by a total of 400 Syrian young people aged 18-24 years, half of whom are women and half male.
Half of the interviews were held in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the survey, over half of young Syrian refugees do not believe that they will return to their country of origin permanently in the future.
Forty-two per cent of respondents may come back to their home country and four per cent could not say.
According to the survey, youth's decision to return home is most affected by the war in Syria and the presence of Isis in Syria.
Almost (47%) considers the end of the war to be the most impressive factor for a permanent return to home, while the quarter considers it important that Isis leave the country.
Only a third raise the main decision to act as factors for economic recovery or for the departure of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military operations alone do not resolve conflict.
The Syrian youngster was asked what factor is the most important factor for closing the conflict.
The majority believe that the end of the war is more essential than the abandonment of President Bashar al-Assad from power.
A fair quarter considers the Al-Assad P.O.D. to be an obstacle to the Agreement.
Almost half of them experience the need for both political and military solutions to end the current Syrian conflict.
The resolution of the conflict through mere military action does not believe like a fair quarter.
A majority of Syrian refugees see Isis' power over the last year, while another fifth considers that power has been strengthened.
According to the respondents, the most important thing in the fight against human beings, and usually against terrorism, is that the media pass on information to the public that Isis has nothing to do with Islamism.
Almost as many of them raised as the first instrument of military action as well as training reform.
A fair tenth thought it would be important to create better paid jobs for young people.
When asking about the effects of the more senior regime on the Syrian conflict, 66% of respondents believe that the conflict will not change during the future regime.
Almost one in four thinks the Syrian conflict is getting worse in the period of the Right.
The views are divided into two areas: whether Russia and Iran have improved or made the conflict worse.
Monty Wideenius spends half his time coded to keep the Internet in order - the database he developed is used, for example, by Wikipedia and Google.
The Finnish company MariaDB develops the most rapidly growing open source database in the world.
The main product of the MariaDB, founded by "Monty" Widenius, does not pay the user anything and can be developed online by any software that can benefit from any program.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are the users of the Finnish database, but they may not be paying customers.
With the help of the databases, huge databases remain in order and quickly available.
For example, if you use Linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they will use the MariaDB or Ís database.
"All information that is not in the image comes from the database, and the images are also linked to it," explains Widenius.
Widenius, the CEO of MariaDB, spends about half his time working coded out.
A man who makes beautiful hand-to-hand telework will help to make sure that the internet works smoothly.
Wideenius developed the world's most popular open source database together with Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the technology company Sun bought a billion dollars, and one year later the software left Oracle in your possession of Sun 7.4 billion.
The Oracle trade took place, much of the developers of the company reported leaving.
"They did not want to work for Oracle, who did not promise a certain promise of the future of the  yet", recalls Widenius.
He had already set up a company at this point that started developing MariaDB.
He did not want his life's work to die.
I hired the Sun to hire a few of the best developers, and I made sure that the sequence of the code is secured by the same friends as the ones who created it.
As an open source database, MariaDB was able to develop its own branch.
I just had to change the name.
A foundation was established to monitor the freedom of the development of the MariaDB code.
"In MYSQL, these assurances were not made", Widenius is troubled.
Many people have heard about Wideenius and the billionth store of Widenius, few Finns know anything about MariaDB.
"For the last years, our growth rate has been around 50% per annum," says Kenneth Paqvalén, CEO of MariaDB.
The MEDB, which is focused on growth, is not yet winning, and Paqvalén is familiar with the company's identification numbers.
He thus reveals that in the current financial year, MariaDB estimates that it will receive EUR 20 million of orders for the benefit of MaryDB.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around it that customers are prepared to pay for.
MariaDB will also help to exchange databases, which could be a career for more than a year if the customer has used a closed database.
Exchange of information to the MEDB will be possible in a moment because they are different from each other.
Among other things, the Spanish operator Telefónica and the largest bank in South-East Asia DBS are MariaDB's paying customers.
The most common cloud services such as Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Alibaban Cloud, are providing customers with a MariaDB.
At the same time, MariaDB automatically spreads to new users in the distribution packages of Linux operating systems, where MariaDB has largely replaced the ING.
Even if we are a company, we have connections to the biggest games.
"Our customers include the world's largest telecommunications operators, gambling companies, banks and even a central bank", Paqvalén list.
The database is still a database of giants such as Oralen, Microsoft, IBM and SAP in their closed databases.
Oracle too is a modest side business compared to the company’s traditional closed database.
Although, according to the research company Gartner, the largest database companies in recent years have lost market share, in turnover, players such as MariaDB are still insignificant, albeit fast-growing ink.
About $50 billion in the database market, open source databases are not even worth billions.
However, the value of the open source cannot be measured only in cash, as most users do not pay for any of these software.
Gartner predicts that in 2018 companies will already generate more than 70% of their internal applications over open databases.
In addition, more than half of the existing databases would have been replaced at that time, or at least a change would have begun.
Large companies do not receive new customers because most of them choose the next open source code.
This has resulted in the licensing fees for commercial databases jumping into the clouds.
The companies want to do as much more than before with a smaller quantity of goods", Wedenius asks.
Since the exchange of a closed database is cumbersome, most of the customers have been listening to price increases.
“There are many customers that are very difficult to move to because their old applications and others are closed in a closed database,” says Wedenius.
However, he believes that customer numbers are coming to an end.
When licence fees increase every year, the customer will sooner or later be transferred to the open source database.
The price is 10-20 per cent of the previous price, and the service is better because the customer can easily switch to another database if he wishes to.
Moreover, many companies are facing major system changes as they transfer their operations to cloud services.
At the same time, many exchanges database software.
Last spring, the MariaDB received EUR 25 million of loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) from the EIB.
It was the largest growth rate ever received by the EIB in the Nordic countries.
The company has around 115 employees worldwide, with the intention of hiring more employees now.
One of the reasons for the EIB’s funding was the impact of MariaDB on public IT procurement.
For example, in Britain and Germany, the company has customers in the public sector.
In a public sector in Europe, billions of euros are being spent annually in databases.
"Many countries want to move to open-source solutions and use tax money more efficiently", says Paqvalén.
Wideenius regrets how money is spent in Finland, perhaps in closed healthcare systems, when open systems are cheaper, and the subscriber is not at the hands of a single software company.
People say that the open source is ideology, but I think it's a better way to do the code.
The Community will help and do something that it cannot or cannot do itself.
The 55-year-old Wideenius belongs to another Finnish supplier, Linus Torvalds, alongside Linux, the most known open source promoters.
Wideenius helps other companies to develop operating business models over an open source code.
I am still holding 4-5 talks annually around the world on this subject.
The Commission will strengthen its position on civil society civil protection services.
Italy has warned non-governmental organisations which, on their own initiative, rescue refugees in the Mediterranean Sea that they should not take action unless they commit to comply with the new rules on their activities.
"If NGOs are not bound by the new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they could continue to operate," said Minister of State Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa.
Minnit's warning came from the day after the German authorities seized a ship of the German Jugend Rettet Aid Office, suspected of cooperating with human traffickers who contributed to illegal immigration.
For only one year, the AA that had been working for a single year refused to comment on the detailed accusations of the D.A.'s Ambrogio Cartosion.
"For us to save lives is and will be important, and we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue area," the organization announced in a public media statement.
"We can only judge the accusations after we have gathered all the necessary information and are able to assess the situation."
The authorities had observed the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
It is suspected that the crew has received boat-by-boat refugees directly from the human submersible drivers who have re-introduced the boats.
One of these cases is claimed to have occurred just a few kilometers from the coast of the Republican coast, and the information is shown in the D.A.'s document published by the Italian media.
The crew is suspected to have been threatened by the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors the rescue operations in the area.
According to the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa must be accompanied by an Italian police officer who supervises the operation.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far agreed to follow the Code of Conduct: Save Children and Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
which, on Thursday, announced that it considered the new rules to be unnecessary or acceptable, because they do not cause significant changes or obstacles to the organisation's rescue activities.
Among those responsible for complying with the guidelines, Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders is the Nobel Organisation for Doctors.
Minnit noted that the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy as a result of the rescue measures has fallen sharply over the last few weeks, which he considers to be evidence that actions to strengthen the Baltic Coast Guard and to cooperate with the local mayors will be producing results.
"The last days have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," he said.
He revealed that the plans were to continue this month's discussions with the Presidents-General of Libya on economic development projects and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of refugees leaving Europe.
A seasonal worker is suspected to have killed his/her husband at Enontegy, a suspect was found on the ground - a case for the prosecutor.
The suspected crime occurred at the Enontekiö Käts last December.
According to the police, a Czech 36-year-old man is suspected to have killed his 26-year-old Scottish partner.
In the past, it has been said that they were seasonal workers.
The police have also told us that after what they did, a suspect would have escaped with two dogs to the ground.
A man was found frozen in the country, and he did not resist when he was caught.
The case must be brought up within the next week.
The case may be retreaded before the district court of Lapland during August.
Robert Hardy, known for Harry Potter and My All - My friend series, is dead.
Brittany actor Robert Hardy has died at the age of 91.
On Thursday, about the death of the actor, this family was reported to be this family.
In 1925 Hardy, born in 1925, began her acting career at the theatre at 24 years of age.
During his long career, he also performed in cinema and television.
Hardy is especially remembered for the role of magic minister Cornelius Toffee in Harry Potter films and for his role as a veterinarian in the series “My My All-Amongst friend” based on the book by James Herriot.
The BBC's popular series was filmed in total over seven years.
Michelleier was sentenced to prison for text messages that led to suicide.
A woman in Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for text messages and calls that she was considered encouraged to commit the suicide of Conrad Roy.
Michelle Carter, 20, will be sentenced to 15 months in prison and five years on parole.
He was convicted of the murder in June, and he was killed by Conrad Roy on 13 July 1994.
"My family's broken", Conrad's father said at Thursday's session.
"My son was my best friend."
He appealed to the judgment and was given the opportunity to wait for the application to be dealt with.
He was threatened by a 20-year sentence, but according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffer from mental health problems.
Carter listened to his judgment with his hands crucified with weeping eyes on the ground.
"His actions killed Conrad Roy," the D.A. said to the court.
"He chose Conrad's life to improve his own.
He has not taken any responsibility", the D.A. continued.
"He has not shown any regret."
According to the lawyer's case, the case was due to "impressive circumstances that are deeply regretting".
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz felt that Carter's "age or maturity or even mental health problems had no significant impact on his actions.
The D.A. answered the statement by Conrad's mother, Lynn Roy, in which she told me that "it won't happen to happen to me that I didn't hear the death of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm going to get through this, and I'm trying to comfort his sister in this pain that we're always going to bear."
Conrad's sister, Camdyn Roy, told the court that she was "worshiped" by the idea that she would never see his brother's wedding and not be aunt's baby.
"There is a painful man who has been in my life every day since my birth, and that system will never deteriorate," Camdy said.
The case will appear to be a precedent, as there is no law in the state of Massachusetts that instigating suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in the car in 2014 when he was found killed in a coon poisoning operation.
The incident attracted national attention when it turned out that Carter in his text messages had encouraged his son to commit suicide.
"Her yourself, jump from the roof, stab yourself. I don't know how there are many ways," Carter wrote in many messages that he had sent to Roy in the last two weeks since he died. Roy was on vacation with his family at that time.
Just before Roy killed himself, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start the generator, and you're free and free."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention on Roy's death, and the judge ordered that Carter would not be able to benefit from the case by providing interviews.
The case has divided expert opinions.
One of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30, who was convicted of the murder of his British roommates in Italy in 2007. He was released two years later.
The Los Angeles Times published Knox's opinion, which states: "Michelle Carter needs compassion and help, not prison."
Secretary-General of NATO: You're going to Russia the worst day after the cold air.
The military union NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, commenting on Thursday by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think I can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg observed during the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
However, particularly since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to Russia's continued instability in the region of the East, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, Nato is, however, still committed to working so that the tensions do not become tense.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to prevent the situation from getting worse and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump of the United States arrived at a dangerously low level between the United States and Russia.
Trump called on the country to thank the House for the bad luck that adopted last week's new sanctions against Russia.
A video will make modifications to 850,000 diesel engines due to a set-off by car manufacturers.
One day before Audi's announcement, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
The BMW Director said that the company believes that "there are more reasonable options than driving restrictions". He referred to European cities, including the home city of BMW, Munich, which seek to restrict or prohibit the use of diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced changes to more than three million Mercedes engines in order to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the partners spoke of a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly marketed the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to achieve their CO2 emissions targets.
Nitrogen oxides from diesel engines are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
Installation costs for emission neutralising equipment will increase, making it difficult for cars to price competitively.
German car manufacturers are being closely monitored, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been accused of association with large car companies and of ignoring problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen. Volkswagen installed devices in cars that reduced emissions to comply with the regulations in tests. In normal driving, emissions were higher than in normal driving.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States, but the activities of the leaders are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former Director responsible for thermodynamics in the DG Audi was arrested in Germany.
Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so he can be handed over to the United States for a possible trial.
In the past year, Audi was involved in a crime investigation into Volkswagen, and the authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system in its cars that could circumvent Europe's emissions requirements. The charge was based on a corresponding investigation in the United States.
The audit may seriously undermine the status of Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars’ share of Volkswagen’s profits is disproportionately high.
The vote in Venezuela opened a false investigation, large demonstrations in the permit.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities is at least one million higher than the number of real voters.
This is an unprecedented opinion from a company that has no role to play in the election result, the Chairman of the National Electoral Commission, Tibisay Lucenan, told journalists.
Maduro will convince the end of the crisis.
In Venezuela on Sunday, in a controversial vote, a parliament was elected to amend the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has strongly criticised the vote and organised protests against its amendment.
The opposition against Madro has postponed its own demonstrations so that they would be running at the time of their appointment.
According to El Pais, on Wednesday night, national security forces began to take over the national Parliament building on Wednesday night.
The purpose of the staff is to ensure the security of the appointment ceremony.
Climate change threatens Provence's lavender lavender.
Lavenders have become the symbol of the Southern French Provence region, but now they are under threat of climate change.
The lavender had been reduced due to dry and disease-bearing insects, and researchers and farmers are eager to find a solution to the problem.
"The lavender is, in fact, a threat in the Provence region because it has suffered from the effects of climate change in recent years, which has led to a clear decrease in spring and autumn rainfalls, especially in the case of autumn rain," says Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPAM Research Institute specialising in agriculture in Provence.
"This shortens the lifetime of the lavender.
In addition, drought has brought in a lot of small piles that spread microbes."
The odds are hard.
Lavender oil attracts tourists, and it is also a highly desirable ingredient of perfume and cosmetics.
"We now have smaller flowers, which are poorly developed or lost or missing, instead of long nuts and large flowers," says Chaisse.
"In other words, there are fewer elements of essential oil."
The solution is sought by enhancing irrigation, by controlling the loss of soil moisture and by spraying plants with a mixture of clay and water, and by developing more sustainable varieties.
The murder of a supplier poses a growing threat in Mexico.
The delivery of the once-weekly Rioja newspaper usually meets on Wednesdays to discuss how the paper deals with the latest cases of organised crime, corrupt authorities and endless drug war in the state of Salaloa.
However, today we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
Officials have been invited to change their daily routines.
Two experienced journalists will discuss who is safer: leave the child home or bring him with them in the delivery that was carried out in 2009.
Security experts have written three words to the table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask for names from suppliers for each group, no evidence is required, no conclusions and no knowledge is sufficient.
A list of names of drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and suppliers suspected to be on the pay lists of government or drug cartels, who are criminals who make Mexico’s chaos news life-threatening.
According to the Consumer Protection Committee, at least 25 journalists have been murdered following the entry into office of President Enrique Peña Nieto in December 2012 of 589 journalists under the protection of the Federal Republic of Germany have been murdered in the following year.
The most recent victims are Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder of Rioce, the supplier and the source of inspiration.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote together about many of his books on drug abuse.
He is deeply wanted, even though he is present. The front of the Rio Dome building is covered by a huge picture of Valdez showing his middle finger. The picture reads: "Right." The thirty-year-old journalists Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have gone ahead with T-shirts that decorate Valdez’s smiling faces. Valdez has glasses and has been branded the mark.
The meeting will take place less than two months after the death of Valdez, and journalists will discuss together their trauma, nightmare, insomnia and fears of paranoia.
In 2010, a federal prosecutor's office was set up, in particular for the handling of cases involving suppliers, but according to the Consumer Protection Committee, only two accusations have been raised so far.
The killers of journalists will only be court-martially, as well as the few murders related to thousands of drug trafficking and organised crime each year will be brought to justice.
Riodoke journalists intend to continue writing about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are sad and the situation is even more dangerous.
According to Ibarra, the safety meeting is of little use because the killers are not known and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is literally a waste of time," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why."
Valdez had left Riodope's delivery in the state capital of Culiacan on 15 May 2017 in the morning.
He had only driven a couple of blocks away in his red Toyoto when two men stopped him and forced him out of his car and shot twelve shots. The amount is supposed to be linked to the magazine: Riodoce means twelve rivers.
The shooter drove away by Valdez's car and crashed it a few miles away.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She was killed by a wife and two adult children.
The rumors are moving fast and they are free of charge in Culiacan.
However, the death of Valdez is a mouse lashe.
The toad has been one of Mexico's most bleeding fields since Guzman was arrested last year and deported to the United States in January. Competitive groups want to fill the void.
Some or several people are shot to death on the streets of the wall every day, and in the cemetery there are two-storey two-storey burial buildings, larger than many households, which are decorated with drug bars.
In a state along the coast there is a "peaceful" when only one cartel controls ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, the founder and director of Rioce, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes led to the murder of Valdez.
In February, Riodope launched an interview with Damascus Lopez, leading a competing group to fight against Guzman's boys.
The case may have pissed off Guzman's boys: customers suspected of being part of the gang bought every issue of the magazine as soon as the magazine arrived at the points of entry.
Another mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country after another newspaper published in the same case was attacked.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is considered a turning point in the violence against journalists.
He had survived so many that his friends and colleagues no longer knew how to fear for him.
He had worked a long career in Noroese when he decided to set up Riodene with five colleagues in 2003, and the shares in the magazine were sold at that time for $50.
In the title "It was impossible to make journalism without addressing the drug problem", Bojorquez says.
In time, the magazine began to feel bold and honest about its stories, and its sales and advertising revenues increased.
Editors appreciated the possibility of publishing a high-class study journalism without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by the journal stories that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its creation, Riodoce won a prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for her news in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez received the International Freedom of the Press Award of the Consumer Protection Committee for its courage to follow the Mexican drug trafficking story with no determination.
He openly expressed his fear.
"I want to be able to continue my life," he said when he received the Consumer Protection Committee award.
Drug trafficking is a "life-style" in Telelo, Valdez said at the Rompeviento TV interview last October.
"The officer must accept the task he falls for... or appear stupid.
I don't want anyone to have to ask me where I was when they sowed death here - why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
The staff of the Riodoke longs for Valdez — a joker who cursed like a port worker who misses a friend who always got hugs and advice, and they need a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routines.
He always used a rooster.
He went to the opposite of the delivery at El Guayabo bar and was always sitting at the same table.
Now they ask if the routines were due to his destiny.
The death of a colleague has also led them to wonder how they can best do their job and survive.
"The criminals do not like it when we deal with their women and children and their clean business, their secret routes of drug trafficking.
They were excluded from the case," Bojorquez says.
At best, it meant strong self-density and self-protection,
Trusting your own instincts.
If you feel that everything is not right, you need to stay away from it.
According to Riodoce's supplier, Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the impression may fail, and so happened in the case of Javier.
The old rules are no longer valid in Linalo, nor are they valid in Tamaulpas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states with dangerous networks: attractive smuggling routes, weak agencies and corrupt authorities.
The environment changes all the time.
Cell phones were not allowed to be brought to the room where Riodoce's safety training was held. A few days earlier, it had become apparent that only spying programmes sold to governments had been followed by activists and journalists in Mexico.
Outside the building, two policemen had applied for a tree shelter to protect them from 40 degrees of heat.
The federal government had ordered them to guard Riodoce’s premises in a four-story building in the middle-class Culican area.
Participants were half-gamed by the fact that these two policemen were part of the 50 % group that the governor of the state did not think was reliable.
It had been months since the journalists had visited a mountainous countryside dominated by drug gangs.
The delivery of this issue to the number of Riodoce was scheduled for three main cases.
Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Toaloa.
The magazine also planned to reveal that the government’s spending had been concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
In addition, one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, just a block from the D.A.'s office, was a kidnapping group of people.
It was not official knowledge of who had been kidnapped and how, so it had to be done with caution: everyone in the city knew that the restaurant was in the favor of both the dealers and the authorities.
The supplier found out from public documents that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling institution of the Revolutionary Party (PRI). PRI has been managing Mexican policy at all levels for almost a century now.
The governors belonging to it have recently been accused of corruption in cases of high public access.
On one of them, the son of "El Chapo" Guzman managed to escape and avoid the army raid.
A few months earlier, readers would have known that they had reliable information on the Valdez column about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened before," says the 46-year-old Villarreal, who has received the nickname "El Flaco", the smartest because of his tender body structure.
"Now all connections to our sources are broken."
Valdez's work room has been converted into a warehouse where signs and labels against the persecution of suppliers are kept, and the employees of the magazine have received a new, unexpected task: they have become activists in the field of freedom of the press.
Ms. Miriam Ramirez, the journalist, took with her a few signs the next morning of her leaving for the local prosecutor's office for a demonstration of another murder of the journalist.
Salvador disappeared three days after the murder of Valdez in the West State of Michoacan.
After the disappearance, a burned body was found that, based on DNA tests carried out by the authorities, is Adame.
Journalists have started to protest more loudly throughout the country. In the demonstrations of the corridors and in the buildings "SOS Press" texts appear.
Today, President Bojorquez is in Washington, where he is trying to obtain support for the investigation of the Valdez case.
The day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez met the Governor of Sinaloa and accused the authorities of spying on and killing journalists because they were telling the truth.
He has asked for him to be removed from government proceedings because he is concerned that he cannot be objective in his hatred.
Valdez had repeatedly found that in Mexico, operators are surrounded by organised crime, by authorities allowing crime and by an unintermediated society.
In its latest book Narco-journalism Valdez writes that drug gangs are killing journalists, but they are also killed for the cause of politicians and security forces in agreement with organised crime.
According to Articulo 19, more than half of the attacks on suppliers last year were made by police and public authorities.
"How many people are silenced by killing," says Ramirez.
The murders have a debilitating effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macas in the northern Tamaulipas border state six years ago.
There was a message signed by Zetas cartel near his body: "I'm here for my articles."
By the head cut off was the computer's keyboard and hearing aids.
Some of the magazines have been decided to end their activities, such as the El Norte newspaper, in the northern Chihua border state, after the March murder of Miroslava Breach, the correspondent in Miroslava Breach.
As Nuevo Laredon El Manana, who was its leader, he was murdered in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message on its website to drug cartels: "What do you want from us?"
Participants have fled their states or the whole country.
It's hard to make a decision.
It is difficult to find work on the Earth, and we must be on guard all the time.
In 2015 criminals sought the supplier's hand, as apparently visited photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in a residence in Mexico City in 2015 three months after he fled from Verasruz.
For those who keep on working, every day is full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra, who was once to become a poet, admits that writing about the drug trade scares me.
"I became a journalist because Mexico is going to hell," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce's suppliers sat at midnight at the front door of the delivery at a beer when the latest issue of the magazine had been completed.
19 people had died during the shooting between competing gangs and security forces at Mazatlan coastline.
The war accelerated, as promised in the messages of the cartel found in the area.
Suppliers put news on Riodoce's website from the sidewalk with their smartphones.
The plan is to reschedule the next day.
Sirgens howl in the vicinity – another shooting scene.
Bojorquez looked at the supply of guarding policemen:
If they were scared, they covered it very well.
The supply of Rioce continued the tradition of a murdered founder under this massive figure, where a man shows the center finger to the entire Cala.
Bojorquez says that you can't even think about stopping the operation. "How can I stop the magazine when our intern asked you to go out on the street and do a case the same day that Javier was murdered?"
Hannu Mannise's Olympic project began with a huge setback - "A hard place".
Hannu Mannise’s celebration, which was 39 years old in April, remained short, as the professional pilot started preparing for the Olympic season.
However, the training period began to be disastrous when Mannine became infected with the flu.
From then on, it became a long treatment period, which stretched to a length of about five weeks.
May went on to complete illness in the first place.
At first, there was a flu and, finally, a disease of the child such as otitis, to which I had to eat an antibiotic.
I was able to make only 10% of the planned operations.
I don't remember the last time I've been so sick that long.
It was a tough place when I couldn't get used to training, and Mannine's gonna tell Evening Sannom.
The test result failed.
The 2007 World Cup was granted a training permit until the second week of June of the 12th edition of the World Cup and Top Sports Research Centre at the IKHU Unrolled Test.
During the test, a sportsman skis with rollers on a carpet that is raised every three minutes.
After every three minutes, the carpet stops for about ten seconds, and the tester takes a milk sample from the finger of the athlete with the needle from the finger.
Last time I went on a carpet for 32 minutes, but now I'm only going to be 28 minutes.
Fire on the wall, Mannine will tell you.
The right direction is better.
After the transformations, Manninen tells me that she has remained healthy.
I have done a wide range of peaceful aerobic exercises that have been trying to normalize the body’s metabolism.
Now is a really good five-week period.
It was also scheduled to be a week and a half vacation from flight duty.
I also have time to visit the cabin with my family.
This year, Manninen participated in only four World Cup competitions before the World Cups in Lahti.
The best result was seen in the opening competition as Manninen climbed to London on top of the ski race.
The gear drawn shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.
The chief coach of Manninen and the national team, Petter Kkänen, has made a training and competition plan for the next month until February.
We are now applying for a different rhythm compared to last season.
After the next week's competitions, Ruka would have three World Cups weekend.
The purpose of December is to attend at least one weekend of the world Cup, perhaps in Nasau.
The plans at the end of January would still be part of Seefeld's plans.
I hope after that the name is from the list of the Olympic Team, says Manninen.
The Olympics in Pyong Chang would already be the sixth Winter Olympics in Manninen's career.
Now the most important thing is to be healthy, in Salt Lake City in 2002, the gold in the team race, which was celebrated below the bottom line.
Dinosaur protected itself against its enemies by masking their costumes.
At first, it looks like a scary statue.
Now researchers have revealed the first results of the investigation of a creature of the size of the rhinoceros found by a Canadian miner, which had been so well preserved that experts called it Mona Erti of dinosaurs.
It had survived so well that researchers could even determine that its Finnish skin was red and had been "an incorrect past."
According to the Current Biology magazine, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur and world-class representatives of its best species.
Recently found fossil is a nodosaurus that lived in the mid-terms of the union 110-112 million years ago.
Scientists consider this amazingly well-preserved fossil to be a very important discovery.
According to the Geographic magazine, an armoured vegetarian is originally the best preserved fossil of all time.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Canada, northern Algeria, on 21 March 2011, and was found by an inn named Swan Funk.
He hit something that did not seem to be a natural part of the surrounding flame, and decided to examine its findings more closely.
The fossil found in the rock was sent to the royal paleontological museum in Tyrrell.
The beast was dug up for six years out of a locust of 1,100 kilos.
The hard work results are now on display.
"If you close your eyes, you may believe that it was in bed," says the journalist Caleb Brown, who works at the Royal Museum of Researcher Tyrrell.
"It remains in the history of science of dinosaurs Mona Lisa, one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs.
The skin studies found that the meat-eating dinosaurs were likely to pose a significant threat to this herbivore, even though they were armored and reminded of the forthcoming tank wagon.
Its red-and-white armor masks it from predators, and it was also protected by darker and lighter colouring on top of it, still present in many animals.
According to experts, it was better able to blend into its environment and avoid its enemies, larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old nodosaurus rose to its headlines in May, and it is now on display in Tyrrell's royal paleontological museum.
Researchers have named it Borelaple as markmichelli's mechanic Mark Mitchell. Mitchell was part of a team from which more than 7,000 hours of digging up the dinosaur.
The nodosaurus has been so amazingly preserved that Mitchell and the team of international scientists have been able to determine the patterns and shape of its body’s veins and armor.
They found that it was still protected in the animal world by a general colour with a darker and lighter body on top.
The observation was still a surprise, since Borelaple is significantly larger than the current animals with the corresponding colouring.
It can be concluded that the meat-eating dinosaurs caught it to the point that evolution favoured survival as a way of hiding instead of fighting.
Of the current animals, for example, peuros, zebras and armadillos have a similar colour. They are considerably smaller and therefore easier to catch, suggesting that even nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
“The pollution of a large, heavily armed dinosaur tells how dangerous the union’s dinosaurs were,” says Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the stems of Nodosaurus reveals that its skin was brown.
Scientists will continue to study nodosaurs in order to draw conclusions from its life, including the end of its intestines to find out what it was at the last place.
Researchers believe that when it died, it fell into a river and drove to the sea where it sank on the seabed.
Alberta was at that time as warm as today in Florida, and rivers and seas were likely to go much further than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is very significant because its Finnish skin has remained and has remained three-dimensionally in its original form," says Brown.
"Therefore, it appears to be just as similar as in the previous period of the Union.
Its representation does not require much imagination: if you stretch a little eye, you can hardly believe it was in bed."
The day was the period of the theropods, the vast two-legged, meat-eating dinosaurs.
Although their king, Tyrannaurus rex, or millions of years earlier, Borelopella, its mighty protagonists may have caught up in this armored dinosaur.
The successors of the tyranosaurus rex included, for example, Acrocanthosaurus, a six-ton monster about 11.5 metres long.
The latest findings of Nodosaur’s researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, which believes that Borealop was washed up in the sea after death and mutilated into mud.
It was found in the Suncor Millenium mine in Canada, northern Algeria, on 21 March 2011, and was found by an inn named Swan Funk.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-preserved armored dinosaur with its skins and armored armour.
The cranes were on average five meters long and weighing up to 1,300 kg.
Two half-metres of spiked from their stage rose from their stage.
Researchers believe that this armoured vegetarian went through the present West Canada until the flooded river carried it to the open sea.
The armour has remained in small detail in the sea-based grave.
Its fossilized residues have survived so well that its skin remains in its armored plates along its skull.
In the National Geographic magazine, Mr Greshko wrote that maintaining this kind of thing is "uncommon as a lottery profit.
The more you look at it, the more amazing it feels.
There's still fossilized skin in the dusty discs on the top of its skull wall.
Its right front is on its side, five toes up.
I can also calculate its lower ground shrubs."
How did one activist learn to answer the question: Who are the streets?
Mr Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked on 9 August 2014.
She had arrived a day earlier in New York from her home in St. Louis and sat on her airbnb apartment to browse Facebook on her phone.
Then he asked his high school student to write:
"It would have killed an 18-year-old, and his body is still on the street."
He was confused to note that no one else had posted the same information in his feed, which is why he closed Facebook and opened it.
There were a number of re-indications from @TheePharoh.
His name belongs to a rapper living in St. Louis who Twitched in real time about Michael Brown's death. The White Police had shot an unarmed 18-year-old black Brown in the state of Missouri, in the state of Ferguson.
This user had also posted a picture of Brown's alive body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is incredible," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
He put his phone away, and when he came back later that night, people were told that they were gathering for Canfield Drive.
Users posted photos of police closures and screaming people, as well as the man who himself claimed to be the father of Brown, who said on the sign that said, "Fergison's police just killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell was following a real-time video film where the police were standing with a dog barking in front of the protestors.
He also tells me that he saw a video of another police officer exhaling his rifle and screaming, "I'm gonna kill all of you... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers he said.
"It wasn't a murder that we're used to and could be described as typical.
I feel cold colors.
I was afraid and they were."
He booked a return flight home for the next day.
The plane landed at eleven o'clock last night. Ferrell came by to pick up his six-year-old daughter from his father and decided to leave the next morning in the synagogue.
What happened to Ferrelli and Ferguson over the next three years has been the documentary "Whose Streets?". It was first night at cinemas on 11 August 2017.
The film is a story of survival and demonstration, love and loss, and strength and persuasion from the point of view of the local people who went on the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell drove towards the Floristries of Ferguson and his daughter, who had been dressed together with her, they had a discussion again about what it was like to live in black and where it was. They had spoken countless times before that morning.
"Do you remember when I told you how black people have had to fight for the things that they believe?" Ferrell remembers what he said.
"We're going to Fernando because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't save my daughter from me," Ferrell told me later.
"The events of today are... the climax of past events.
My daughter has a right to know and to grow to know it.
He needs to have the capacity to act and organise, but he also needs to know the different levels and conditions of living as a black person, and he needs to know what we need to do to be released in order to free ourselves.
Fortunately, though I have been able to protect her from gross racism, she is still similar to other black girls.
I feel like I would harm her if I protected her from reality."
Their first stop was in Ferguson, South Florida Road, opposite the police station, which became a campplace for activists when they were waiting for information on the case and finally learned that no charges would be brought against the police.
That's where Ferrell and his daughters went to help a local entrepreneur who made lunch packages.
They packed lunches in bags and distributed them to protestors.
Ferrell began to react differently to the actions.
"Activism changed completely after August 9th," he says. While studying at the University of Missouri, St. Louis, Ferrell was chairman of the organization of minor nurses, focusing on food rights and health differences in black communities.
"I had no experience in organising.
Somehow it just happened."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with Sabah Folayan, the assistant director of the document in the evening talk.
Folayan said that he and the photographer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "wanted simply to tell" what was happening.
Ferrell's mind was a dim doubt, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you have a story that you can take advantage of?"
The suspicion was based on the countless times that people, usually whites, had appeared in the local community who wanted only to benefit from its difficulties and persuasion.
"We heard that those born and raised in Ferguson did not have a common voice," Folayan told us recently in an interview. "We wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already contacted Assistant Director Damon Davis, who is known for his activity with the sentenced prisoners.
Davis’s involvement led Ferrell to join the project, together with six other locals, to follow events in the years following Brown’s shooting.
"This is not a document in which someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we speak for us," he says.
"For me, the most important thing is how local people are represented in a movie, because I am presented in the same way."
According to Folayan, the purpose was not to focus on Ferrel's beliefs because it was intended to show that the popular movement "is not a charismatic leader but a community".
That is why it is evident that there are surprisingly private aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and getting married.
"I felt kind of naked", Ferrell telling me what it felt like to see a movie for the first time.
"I understand that this work and the human representation of blacks require a certain degree of vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story for the occasion and brings back to the middle the role of black queer women in a wider Black Lives Matter movement.
It was born in the social media (#BlackLivesMatter) after the police shot a black teen named Trayvon Martin in 2012. Two of the three founders of the movement are identical to the ring-identity.
"The leadership of black queer women has maintained the whole movement," Ferrell says. "It's because we have to fight on many fronts all the time.
Black queer women have had to endure everything."
Folayan agrees: "There are indeed black women who maintain a lot of queer women."
However, he stressed that Ferrell had not been selected for its "self-intended" queer identity because of the document.
"He's got energy," Folayan says.
"It is no coincidence, however, that he was at the front line, but black queer women live in a lot of things at the cutting point, and they have a lot of play at stake.
"The energy of his energy is passed by a white cloth."
The news groups have left Ferguson a long time ago, but the Community and the police are still tight.
Ferrell still has two and a half years of parole left, and he was convicted of blocking the freeways in protest.
His description of the social climate in his home is short and concise: "Smalling."
Still, he continues to rely on the slogan he learned on the streets of Ferguson three years ago:
"It is our responsibility to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to help and support each other.
We can only lose the chain."
Compatibility: The artist creates images of the DNA of the Chelsea Manning.
The Fridman Gallery in New York has been hanged in the centre of the office space face – white, black and brown faces, between which you can see more closely the similarity.
These 30 works are images taken by artist Heather Dewey-Hagorg based on DNA samples taken from the face and hair of Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent samples from Fort Leavenworth prison where he conducted his 35-year sentence. Manning was sentenced to leaking classified diplomatic telegrams to the WikiLeaks website.
The Dewey-Hagborgin A Before-Resemblance exhibition was opened on 2 August 2017.
It is based on two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines technology, information technology and art in his work. Manning is a transversal and pioneering dissident who was sentenced to prison by Barack Obama on the third day of his term of office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed Manning's DNA from an algorithm and created 30 images based on his genetic data. They are a sharp, albeit a little theoretical, statement on the development of DNA data, multi-interpretation and the underlying causal consequences of interpretations, and findings.
Chelsea Manning, a.k.a. Bradley Edward, has openly reported that he was in agreement with women since the breakup, who in 2013 was found guilty of 20 crimes, including the violation of the spy law, computer fraud and theft.
There was only one picture of the prisoner's condemned Manning: a rascal, black-and-white selfie, where the insuffered Mann is sitting in the car on the driver's seat, with a flat-lit wig on his head, which became his symbol.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a great popularity behind the Stranger Visions project, which he carried out in 2012.
This is where he created portraits based on forensic data, and he got DNA data, for example, on tobacco butts and rages, and created images of what the people in question could have shown.
Then the artist received an email from Paper Magazine magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of their case," Dewey-Hagborg told us about a new exhibition at a press conference.
No visit was made to Manning and he could not be shot in prison. So the paper contacted Chelsea and asked him if he was interested in making Manning a DNA image of Manning.
The artist and his prisoner, by the way, suddenly became friends of correspondence, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even made together a Suppressed Images comic book, pictured by Sheili Kanungo, which described the future in which the President would have alleviated the Telesea judgment and could see the exhibition.
In fact, Obama only shortened Manning's judgment a few days after the publication of the comic book, which was a lucky coincidence after seven rough years in a U.S. military prison in the United States.
It is also impressive that the exhibition is being opened right now, as Donald Trump goes against his own war against the data leaks and transgender soldiers, and still finds new ways to strengthen the powerful divers he was supposed to alleviate in fact.
Dewey-Hagborg believes that "all things have a purpose.
In its opinion, the artist calls for the end of "automatic division based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
The opposite wall has Manning's DNA period: a long line of C, G and A letters written in lead pen.
With this 200 letters – or nucleotide, as the scientific definition used by the artist is – the combination of Dewey-Hagborg will be able to illustrate how similar we all are, at least from our biology.
"I hope my exhibition will help people to understand that we are equal to our genetics and that genetic data is very personal and open to interpretations", says Dewey-Hagborg. It also includes his Spurious Memories video from the year 2007.
"Dna tells countless stories, and here's 30 of them."
The last work of the exhibition is in his own room: page from the cartoons of Manning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There's Manning's character rising out of prison like King Kong, holding a megaphone.
"If they can slow you down, they've won," the picture says.
"Don't ever shut up."
"The text is from the letter I received from Manning," says the artist from Philadelphia.
"It's so impressive that I still get cold colors."
Not as described in the comic book, Manning has not yet seen the exhibition. By the time Manning arrives, he was greeted by faces based on his own genetic data, like a bunch of protestors in the middle of the exhibition space.
It is deliberate, as everything else in this exhibition: for example, the Manning DNA cycle is written in lead pendant for height equal to its length (15,5 cm).
"The Kasvos were on the wall earlier, but I wanted to bring them the feeling of a crowd of people", says Dewey-Hagborg.
"I wanted to describe the mass movement created by Chelsea, which was also behind his release."
The University Professor and an official of Oxford University are wanted as suspects of murder.
The author informs that he has launched national searches to find a professor at the University of Northwest and a staff member of the University of Oxford, who are suspected of being stabbed by a man in a luxury residence in Chicago.
The documents of the Cook County Laws show that on Monday the arrest warrants were issued from Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56 suspected of participating in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duralleau.
According to the documentation, Cornell-Duralleau, 26, died after he had been stabbed several times.
According to the local information provided by the Police Department of Chicago, the body was found on 27 July 2017.
The police alarmed to the Grand Plaza apartment building found a victim with multiple wound wounds in his body.
According to the authorities, Cornell-Durunleu was found dead on the scene and the stab is being investigated as a murder, and the police are actively investigating two suspects.
Lathem has been working as assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Nortwest University since 2007.
In its opinion sent by e-mail, Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President responsible for the University's Social Relations, stated that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been denied access to the University of Northwestern campus campaigns.
"This is a case that the authorities are investigating, and Northwestern University is helping with the investigation," wrote Cubbage.
Warren works as a parent as a financial assistant at Oxford University.
The opinion sent by an email from the University and Somerville College informant states that "we have been in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to help the investigation authorities of the United States in all possible ways."
In addition, the opinion stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and hoped that he would surrender.
Anthony Gugligligliguš, chief officer of the Chicago Police Department, said that he told the suspects to seriously commit themselves to the authorities.
"Police has an understanding of where they are, and we will keep on looking for us," Guglidel said.
According to the regulations, local, regional and national authorities will assist in the search for suspects.
He told the police that he had received a call from the owner of the Grand Plaza building, who had received a vague tip to the fact that something had happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the sight on the scene as horrific.
According to Ggueg, it is unclear whether the victim was murdered on the same day or earlier.
He told me the security cameras told me that Lathem and Warren had been in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had an affair," Guglidjak says.
The Grand Plaza Executive Board published the following information to the residents: "The police are currently working on the process and the background of the victim, as well as possible motives, including the right of domestic violence."
A man threatened to blow up an Islamic bookstore and "kill Muslims" in London.
"I'm not anti-muslimi, I'm Catholic," he said to the police.
The Moffetto must perform 100 hours of unpaid civil service.
A 39-year-old man was convicted of his threats by an Islamic bookstore in London and "kill all Muslims."
According to the Independent magazine, David Moffatt was condemned, among other things, for gross harassment.
According to the police, the bookstore staff called them in on 23 May.
According to the staff, the man had threatened to blow up the bookstore and kill the Muslims.
The suspect left the store after threats.
Moffeatt was caught when he called the police about the threat.
The threat was not related to bookstore events.
The authorities noted that Moffatt had been dressed in the same shape as the suspected book trade transactions, the police officer said.
I'm not anti-muslimi, I'm Catholic, Moffatt said to the police in interrogations.
In the form of a penalty, a man has to make a 100-hour pay-free civil service and pay £620, i.e. about €690 for legal expenses and £85 for victims, i.e. about €95 for victims.
According to Scotland Yard’s informant, a number of hate crimes are left unforgivable.
"We will take action in line with WADA's road map in the near future" – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitally Mutko.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that Russia will soon complete the work under the WADA Road Map of the World Anti-Dating Office to restore the RUSADA's competences of the Russian Anti-Dumping Commission.
"Some of the measures under the road map have already been taken, and RUSADA was entitled to design and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Dumping Commission.
The road map of WadA has been updated in this respect", Mutko noted on Thursday.
The Deputy Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map, which sets out the conditions for the creation of RUSADA's powers. The second part of the road map was published recently on the website of the organisation.
According to the complex, it does not involve any concerns for Russia.
"It's all been announced, and it's all going to be done.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee and the WADA in the near future", Mutko added.
However, one of the points on the road map requires that Russian anti-doping authorities accept publicly the results of the investigation of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, as prescribed by WADA. McLaren investigates the alleged share of the state in Russian sports doping.
Mött stated: "The investigation is ongoing because our anti-dating system has declared failure.
All measures have been taken.
There were no legal programmes, and we cannot accept anything that did not exist."
Mutko said that there was a echo of the opinion of Vitaly Smirnov, Chairman of the Russian independent public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov said earlier that on the same day, he said to Rsport sports media that there have been problems in the Russian anti-doping bodies. "We have said several times that there are conflicting views and provisions in the report.
We will not accept the report on terms and conditions", however, he added.
WADA ordered RUSADA to cease doping control in Russia in November 2015, after the extent of the doping scandal had been revealed.
However, last June it was authorised to design and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UKAD.
Olivier Niggli, Director of WADA, visited the RUSADA headquarters in Moscow in July. After the visit, he noted that the organisation was on the right road to the restoration of powers.
The British organization, as a sceptical Finnishs, for loving innovation: the health benefits of breast-feeding packages "not proven".
The British organization has doubts about the benefits of Finnish-style maternity packages.
Among other things, the BBC and the Guardian report that the Lullaby Trust, who is fighting hide-and-seek deaths, prohibits the use of their own brochures in maternity packages distributed in Britain.
The distribution of maternity packages to all pregnant women will begin this month in Scotland.
In England, too, packaging is shared in some regions.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternity kit reduces the risk of death of a hidden switch.
Cinderella death means the baby's inexplicable death.
Lullaby Trust acts as an expert on British health care authorities in the area of a peaceful dream of a child.
We will no longer be allowed to pack our official brochures on them because it would allow us to understand that we are recommending this product, the organization informed.
Finland has one of the lowest child mortality rates in the world, only two dead thousands per birth.
According to Lullaby Trust, Finland's good reading is the result of many different reasons, such as a small amount of teenage pregnancy.
Giving each family a box may be one factor.
However, you can't say for sure, Francine Bates, CEO of the Lullaby Trust, said.
We are concerned that maternity packages are marketed as products that reduce child mortality and hide-and-seek deaths.
The maternity pack is a Finnish invention and has been given to all mothers in Finland for 80 years for free.
The package contains a variety of articles, such as children's clothing.
This year there are 53 products in the package.
Self-cuffing is a cardboard box in which a child can be put to bed.
According to the Scottish Government, the boxes it distributes meet all the security standards.
Lullaby Trust, on the other hand, says that there is no safety standard for cardboard boxes at their place of bed.
According to Lullaby Trust, packaging may be the best place to sleep if no body or bed is available.
The organization recommends that packaging be used only for daytime and that it ceases to be used when the child can turn around.
The organization also recommends keeping pet animals out of the package and making sure it does not get wet or dirty.
A whimper ran away from another Japanese zoo in Japan.
The staff of the Japanese zoo is looking for a runaway turtle.
The giant turtle has taken over the staff and has fled for the second time in two weeks.
The turtle escaped from the Shibukawa Zoo in Okayama, West Japan, on Tuesday morning.
Security cameras revealed that the frog left the zoo through the main entrance.
It will not die immediately because it eats grass around the zoo, but we are very concerned that Yoshimi Yamane, who works in the zoo, told us.
The deceased's 35-year-old frog is female, 55-kilo and about a meter long.
Yamane describes the escape as quiet and gentle.
As opening hours, the frog is allowed to travel freely in the garden area.
The zoo has not received any visual findings from the yard.
The last runaway took place the other week.
Yamane found a fugitive on the way down the road 150 meters from the zoo.
I noticed it on the way to the zoo.
I stopped my car and asked my colleagues for help, Yamane told me.
It can feel better than we could ever imagine.
These startups will help you to try to avoid Uber making mistakes.
Jäitt wanted to measure the satisfaction of workers in his online business, but the questionnaires didn't work.
The replies were often vague, useless or even misleading.
Although he assured them that the surveys were anonymous, some of the workers were suspicious of them.
"The questions were simply not consistent or objective," Tõrtt says. As a hair care company, Madison Reed focuses on the online trade, with 75 employees.
You decided to seek help from the outside.
More and more new types of management start-ups have come on the market, which will help other companies to find out how their employees are able to do so.
They develop and license software that can measure employee commitment. Companies can conduct surveys and target them to specific teams and population groups, provide their customers with anonymous reporting services and, in some cases, direct contact with the top management.
"My health can be followed by applications such as Strava and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit?" asks the founder and CEO of the Glint-Start in Redwood City, Jim Barnett. Glint provides companies with analytical software to measure employee engagement.
Tätt has been using Glint's software for three years, saying that he has gained a deeper understanding of the thoughts and feelings of his employees.
The programme can make quick surveys and votes for certain teams, and it can also draw up a map of which you can see in one eye, in which departments employees are more dissatisfied and who have received the weakest estimates from the leaders.
Companies have understood that they need to monitor the workplace so that they do not become Uber. The transport company around them has been agitated ever since the former employee wrote in his blog about a culture in which workers are harassed and punished by those who talk about problems.
Such failures for startups such as Glint are an attractive business opportunity.
Corporate governance, regulation and compliance are a global industry, the value of which, according to Let's Talk Payments website, can rise to over $11.7 billion by 2020.
The Convertent is a startup in the Denver state of Colorado, which helps companies to detect and prevent any misuse. Interest in the company grew earlier this year when Uber's reputation experienced a collapse.
The Converent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla, such as Airbnb.
It also concluded an agreement with Uber.
Like Glint, the Convence allows companies to make tailor-made surveys, collect answers in confidence in real time and identify problem areas.
In addition, employees may make an anonymous statement of their behaviour by means of a text message.
And if there is reason to suspect that the manager is not, the complaints go directly to the government of the company.
"The general opinion has been rejected by the authorities," says the founder and CEO of the Conference, Patrick Quinla.
He reminds us that if an undertaking treats its employees badly or does not act unfairly, the consequences may be costly even if they do not intervene, and consumers may start boycotting the company and may also lose the workers and be brought to justice.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain has over 25 000 employees at 500 offices, which have used the Convertent for over a year, because it wants to ensure that employees are aware of policies and practices and are easily contacted by the headquarters.
In the past, if the employee wanted to report the problem, he had to first identify the telephone number or e-mail address that was able to make a statement to the head office, and then he had to make a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
"It was often a scary and unpleasant experience," says Jury James Vitrano of Ruby Tuesday. According to him, the complaints made by employees were difficult to follow.
In the past, problems remained hidden from leaders working in another city or state, and problems such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay can be detected and dealt with more quickly.
"I get a more comprehensive and comprehensive understanding of the worker's reality," says Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"At the same time, we protect our shareholders from employment-related proceedings."
According to Quinn, companies started to take a more serious view of ethics, values and employee engagement after the collapse of the company Arthur Andersen in connection with the Enron scandal as a result of an immoral activity.
By social media, companies understood that they could no longer prevent public debate on their dirty laundry.
"The hope was used as a strategy before technology became a ethical control", says Quinlan.
Glint and Converten offer their software as a service that is regularly charged for use on a regular basis.
It is a business environment and an opportunity for the venturers, both Glint and Convercent, to support the venturers.
In February, the Convence raised USD 10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has accumulated a total of EUR 47 million in capital.
In November, Glint received EUR 10 million from Bessemer Easter Partners and has collected a total of EUR 60 million.
Investments are not a surprise given the links between companies, business associations and venture capital.
Several studies have shown that workers expect more jobs than before.
In a competitive market such as silicon valley, good wages, and interesting projects are just beginning.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they are setting up a genuinely beneficial company.
"Workers commit more strongly to the success of the company if they enjoy the company and feel that they are listening and that their work is rewarding", says Nina McQue, Director of LinkedIn, responsible for the remuneration and well-being of workers.
Investors receive income when companies succeed, companies succeed when employees commit.
The analysis tools of the third party promise to strengthen the commitment of employees, so it is no wonder that they are interested in investors.
According to the experts at the workplace, it is important to know that employees are engaged,
but it is useful if it does not result in measures being taken.
If an undertaking requests feedback from its employees, it may be considered as an indication of the change.
And if the change does not come as soon as possible or if nothing changes, disappointment can reduce the commitment of workers.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be prepared to hold four thousand discussions", says the CEO of Kotter International, the management consultant, who has seen companies rely too much on the collection of information.
"If the company does not take action, employees will start to wonder if they heard them.
and whether or not they think it matters.
If the company does not care about them, why should they care about the company?"
According to Jätti, Madison Reed is currently doing monthly human resources surveys and is able to tackle the problem on the same day it is reported in Glint.
After collecting feedback from frustrated workers in decision-making and the quality of communication, Vättett was able to make changes to teams and organise communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that a deeper understanding will help to improve the sustainability of staff in the long term in an industry known as the high turnover of workers.
"If a company does not commit to creating a culture of content, it will lose workers," Vitrano says.
"If it loses workers, it also costs customers.
And without customers, there are no companies."
In Sweden, 20-year-old man is suspected of illustrating his naked neighbor, reports News Office T.
A woman living in Gothenburg had come home from the shower when she had seen a woman hanging around her desk by a cell phone hanging at the end of a rope.
According to the woman, the cell phone camera photographed the apartment.
The woman who was scared of the incident had run into another room and went to bed.
After she arrived to check the situation, her cell phone had been pulled up first, but shortly thereafter, you will see the window again.
A 20-year-old man who is a suspect in the scan has admitted to shooting a woman.
However, he claimed that he was merely looking at the face of a woman.
The video on the phone had been deleted and the police had not managed to recover it as evidence.
In the interviews, a man has admitted a crime, but he refused to commit a crime.
The man who pictured him was right to say that he loved his neighbor as "the woman crazy".
According to News Office TT, a man is charged with a case.
Teachers call for more responses during the autumn negotiations.
Wage development cannot be lower than, for example, in the export industry, but the difference should be narrowed down, said OAJ President Olli Liukkainen on Thursday.
The temporary operation of public holidays highlights the difference, he points out.
We have no possibility of concluding contracts in which there would be no way of involving deductions of allowances.
In the municipal sector, the contract will only occur once the private sector papers have been signed and the percentages of the increase are known.
A delicate prophecy that, for example, OAJ's working conditions were agreed in January, for example.
Per cent of the targets Luikinen has not yet revealed.
The insult is also the President of the Public Education Association Juku.
Suffering: Lobby allowance surgery increases earnings differentials.
According to OAJ, statistics and forecasts indicate that the purchasing power of public employees is declining, while the purchasing power of the private sector is increasing.
According to the bridegroom, temporary leave cuts will increase earnings differences even further.
In Finland, it is necessary to determine how many students per teacher can be per student.
OAJ also points out that equality in basic education must be ensured, as differences between those who are best and weakest are growing all the time.
According to the organisation, learning outcomes are declining, and differences between both students and regions are growing constantly.
The day of the gamers in Bruins was extended when the NBAA reduced daily exercises by two to one.
It's almost 11 o'clock a.m. A bunch of UCLA American football players have stayed to discuss the campaign's new fields of practice on another side of the campaign.
Some of them have taken off their game shirts, and their heads are whining about the sweat after the first day of the training camp's scratching.
For many of us this few minutes chat class is a noon break.
After three hours of training, players studying at the university summer courses will return to the dormitory for the final exams, and the next morning they will meet at half a half a mile to the Wasserman football center.
"The next three days will be heavy for these guys", coach Jim Mora of Bruins says a little before Mondays change by Tuesday.
The University Sports Ceiling Organisation reduced the number of daily training sessions between two together. The purpose of the change was to reduce the number of players’ work, but it has delayed their date – at least until the end of the final exams.
That's why the first three UCLA exercises started over a quarter past seven o'clock. It was difficult to find space for players at any given time.
The restriction of practicalities in one day means that there is more training time than before. This year, the camp started last year, a week earlier than last year, and this is the first time Mora went through six training courses in Westwood, while the training sessions are being held at the same time as summer courses.
The exercises are scheduled to be held 18 times before August 20th, when the actual preparation for the opening match for the season begins: the UCLA will meet the University of A&M in September.
Mora says that she supported the NCAA's amendment to the rules, even though it made players' schedule even tighter.
"We're gonna do a lot of work for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora says.
"But players are ready to work, they're good friends.
I think it'll make it easier when we get to the accident, and then we'll have more time.
UCLA closes exercises from outside the camp. It is not easy, given the direct view of the parking area adjacent to the training fields and the Luski Center, to a high-quality hotel that has already been bombed on the winds of the safety net behind the target panel.
Bruins players are supposed to move to the hotel next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can arise during the period when the rooms are available to the outside.
"We have security arrangements," Mora says.
"The problem is that people can book a room and shoot exercises on the video from there.
The video description of the exercises is paid quite a lot.
But we have guards over there and in the parking lot.
We do our best.
I'm not gonna bother my head too much.
We have a plan."
The freedom to choose Rwanda is the right thing to do.
On Friday, the Central African Rwanda will hold a presidential election, the winner of which will be considered clear.
Paul Kagame is officially pursuing a third period, but, of course, he has influenced the country's governance since 1994.
At the time, the rebel group RPF ended the genocide of the radically organized population.
Kagame was a commander of RPF.
Kagamea has been criticised, among other things, for crushing the opposition and for restricting the freedom of the word.
He has also been accused of, in particular, distortion of poverty statistics.
For the next season, Kagame will be able to make an effort, as the Constitution, which was limited to two periods of the presidential term, was changed.
In Rwanda, however, Kagame is also the genuinely CEO of Kagame.
In the meantime, social reforms have taken place in Rwanda and international investment has flown.
Kagamina has also played a major role in the unification of a country divided by genocide.
Rwanda's success has led many Africans to ask if liberal multi-party democracy is the right model for African states.
However, Kagame has promised more freedom after the earth has been lifted on its feet.
Now could be a good time to start.
Facebook fights against false news by enhancing the verification of facts.
Facebook intends to send possible false news to more and more independent factual auditors and to present the results below the original article. The world’s largest public network reported this on Thursday.
On its website, the company publishes an opinion that it will start using updated machine learning for the identification of false news. Any false news will be sent to the auditors of facts and the results may be published under the original article.
Facebook has been criticised for being one of the largest false news distributors, and many people believe that false news had an impact on the outcome of the Presidential election in the United States in 2016.
The topic has emerged from a political debate in Europe where French voters were bombarded on false news before the May presidential election and Germany preparing for the September elections will support the plan of fines for social media networks if they do not immediately reject hostile content.
On Thursday, Facebook announced in a separate opinion published in Germany that the verification of facts is being carried out in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Man wants to see which stories do not go through an independent circuit of supervisors, and they also want more background information so that they can decide more carefully what they read and share", said company manager Sara Su in the company's blog.
He added that Facebook will continue to test the Related Articles activity and will also make other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
The birth of a comic book: The story of a castle.
Pietney Castle in Kent County is now known as the Squeeze Music Video and as the hiding place of the Short Thatcher from the 1970s and 1980s.
However, it has 700 years of stormy history behind it. Now this charming castle in the Bewl River Valley is the subject of a comic book written by Jamie Rhodes, a muffled-haired writer who prefers to old documents.
"I like to study the text written by a dead person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says with insight.
"I feel a personal connection when I hold the letter with my hand."
Rhodes' book, A Castle in England, reports the stories of families living in Scotland from the Middle Ages to the Edarian period. Each story has been illustrated by a different artist, a promising British cartoonist: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book based on archives. In 2014, Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories appeared, which was inspired by the documents of the British National Library. The project was emotional.
"I moved into tears in the letter I found with my thumb mark, and the letter had been written by a double agent working for the distributors in the 1700s," Rhodes says.
"It was his prints.
And the letters smell like smoke, because fire was used as lighting at that time.
Three centuries later, the smell makes the reader feel that he himself is on the spot.
The archives!"
A writer who was attracted to old documents was allowed to reside in prison for almost four months with the support of the National Trust Foundation and the National Art Council, which seemed too good to be true. He admits that he could not have been in prison without delay for a little longer than would have been hoped for.
He spent days researching the Victorian "new" castle, archives, treasures and rare things, such as the hyenas that were hanged on the walls and the bottles that were in the flesh for centuries.
He toured the ruins and estates of the old castle and discussed with forest guards, gardeners and sometimes even the artists who pictured the book.
In the evening, he "takes whiskey and starts writing."
The closer history of Scotland is quite unknown, since the castle was transferred to the National Trust Foundation in all its ways only after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
By the time Rhodes arrived ten years later, the Foundation staff was just starting to open an archive. Rhodes describes that the archives had been held for hundreds of years by the same method: taking everything to the night.
The archives had papers, letters from the time of the British Empire and maps of who owned it. "You could imagine that land disputes are boring", Rhodes says. "But here, however, families are fighting for even one struggle.
I thought, "I think we should be already."
Some of the stories are going from prison to England's history, such as The Labourer. It relates to a man who will soon after the completion of the prison, in 1381, joins in the mutiny rebellion of England.
"Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex mentioned that there was a riot in the castle in 1380", Rhodes says.
"The English peasant uprising began in the same area, and it occurred to me that the rebellion could start with a riot.
"What are these events?"
The other stories of the book are closely related to the history of the castle — like The Priest, the story of a priest hidden by the Darrell family during the seven years of the British Reformation.
The Smudger reports the story of Arthur Darrell from the 17th century, who is said to have staged his own funeral by filling his coffin with a stone (it was discovered years later when his grave was opened).
The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family in the Scotney. "The family men have seen to be a lot of jerks, they've been in debt and they've bought stuff they couldn't afford.
The men of the Darrell family would solve their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I can see them as handsome friends who knew how to fertilize the desert."
Rhodes is now applying for new writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in Finland writing a comic book about Life-style, a healing facility in the early 20th century, which is only left with a eutrophic plot.
There's a special place in her heart in the castle at the caretaker's.
"It was sad to leave there," he says.
"I would never have returned to this everyday life of the law."
between the worst cold war in Russia and the worst then cold air.
The military union NATO and Russia have clearly deteriorated, commenting on Thursday by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
Mr Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the conflict in Ukraine.
I think I can say that NATO's relationship with Russia is now more difficult than it has ever been since the end of the cold war, Stoltenberg observed during the CNN interview.
After the end of the Cold War, we hoped that we could pursue close cooperation with Russia.
However, particularly since the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 and due to Russia's continued instability in the region of the East, NATO's relationship with Russia has deteriorated considerably.
According to Stoltenberg, Nato is, however, still committed to working so that the tensions do not become tense.
As long as we are strong and as long as we are predictable, we can engage in a political dialogue with Russia in order to prevent the situation from getting worse and a new cold war.
Before Stoltenberg's comments, President Donald Trump of the United States arrived at a dangerously low level between the United States and Russia.
Trump called on the country to thank the House for the bad luck that adopted last week's new sanctions against Russia.
Vladimir Klishko will cease - the renewal of Anthony Joshua will not be carried out against Anthony Joshua.
Vladimir Klitzko, the world's long-term world champion of professional boxing, finishes his career.
Ukrainian Klishko, 41, announced its decision on Thursday morning.
At the Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, Klichko, who struck gold, took as a professional 69 times winning the 64th prize.
He held different MM contacts between 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klichko lost his career in the last two matches.
Tyson Fury hit him in November 2015.
In April of this year, Klishko met Anthony Joshua at the Wembley Stadium and disappeared after a huge match in the 11th part of the knockout.
Joshua and Klichko were expected to meet at a new price comparison in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klichko did not create any motivation for the match.
I purposely used a few weeks to make a decision to get me a sufficient distance to the Wembley match, Klichko told me in his bulletin.
As an amateur and professional boxer, I achieved everything I dreamed of, and now I want to start my second career after sport.
I could never have imagined having such a long and incredibly successful boxing trip.
I am very grateful for that.
See the Clichko’s reasoning for its decision on the subject.
Bernd Bönte, Klitsko's manager, explained in the bulletin that the closure decision was difficult for Klichko.
However, he has always pointed out that he wants to stop if he doesn't have enough motivation anymore.
That is why this is absolutely the right decision, Bönte stated.
Klishko has been seeing US actor Hayden Panettier since 2009.
The municipality has one child born in 2014, Kaya.
Klichko's big brother Vitali is also a former heavyweight world champion.
During the years 2008-12, the brothers ruled the different covenants' M.M.-to-dos at the same time.
Your editor, the editor of your own, is up against the circumstances: "Get out of the file".
Swimper Minna Nikkanen has suffered from the conditions during the summer’s external railway season.
Minna Nikkas has had problems with the circumstances.
The wind and cold have taken her out of the file.
Even in London's World Cups, there are unstable circumstances.
Minna Nikkanen speaks the weather.
The circumstances have been this summer's stake jumper against Minna Nikh.
I don't want to blame the track, but it was incomprehensible that I didn't even get the little poles to move properly, Nikkinen said after the Innsbruck race.
I've been racing and practicing here knowing how many times I've never experienced the same wind in this place, Nikkanen told me in Paavo Nurmi Games.
During this period, it has been very difficult to standardise jump, even when exercises have had such unstable winds, Nikänen observed in Kaleva’s competitions.
It talked on Thursday in London, too.
The time of the challenge has been to get the technology together - whether it's a cold-frozen thing or not.
It's been cold and windy, and it's been taken from the file.
It makes no sense to consume energy in a bad condition.
Thanks to his 455 hall jumps, he made it to the World Cups.
It's been 445 out there.
The situation in London is not the same for all of us.
There's gotta be a stable and waiting for better winds.
The goal is to reduce the number of days per day by 460.
Why else do you train abroad?
It's not necessary.
Last summer I was in Italy and Germany from the beginning.
I got the jump together and the technique was standardized.
I should have done the same thing now.
Normally, the government has come to deal, now the government has been closed.
What would be the ideal course of competition?
25 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's gonna be small, as long as it's standard.
An experienced ex-officer stunned politicians at Yle: "We have no division now, and we have not many years."
Despite the favourable economic climate, the Government of Juha Sipilä must keep the ice in hand and guard against an increase in the state budget by cash, warn Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared the budgets for decades in the Ministry of Finance, to warn Erkki Virtanen, who has prepared the budgets for the Ministry of Finance.
He says there's no division.
Yle interviewed a retired Virta in 2015 at the Yleösäsäumum on Wednesday.
The state budget for next year is just beginning to build up.
In recent times, politicians' proposals that have been raised by politicians include raising a guarantee pension, calculating car tax and supporting electric bicycles to Virtanen are considered to be electoral speeches.
They often tell us that the elections are starting to be close, because when 10% of the government budget is financed by additional means, we have no division now or for many years.
I'm even a fraud to talk about the distribution, as long as you do, Virtanen told Yle.
Virtanen stressed that all debt owes to children.
The Agency has a long history of the preparation of government budgets: in 1978, he began with the Ministry of Finance as Secretary-General of the Budget and then worked as Deputy Director and Head of Budget of the Budget Department.
Last time he retired, he served as Secretary-General of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy for the Ministry of Employment and the Economy.
Virtanen pointed out in Yle's interview that the projected 3% growth rate is likely to be temporary.
All fortune tellers estimate that this is a spike starting next year, and Finland is expecting a 1% increase for tens of years.
Washington will change the rules for a permanent visa.
According to the media, President Donald Trump announced that the rules of the permanent authorisation, Green Card, would be amended by a new action plan.
The aim is to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighten up the requirements of temporary work permits and limit family visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republics and supported by the President.
The draft law is due to be discussed in two chambers at the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money by changing the way in which permanent residence permits are granted to nationals of other countries.
It will also reduce circular migration and replace the current programme.
Applicants who know English and are able to support themselves and who have useful skills in our economy will benefit from the new search process," Trump said according to the media.
The queen of Denmark's queen's wife does not want to be buried with the queen at this point.
Prince Henry does not want to be buried with Queen Margareta.
The picture shows Prince Henry and Queen Margaree, pictured in April.
The queen of Denmark Margareta, 77, and her neighbor Prince Fölki, 83, will not be buried side by side, says the court of Denmark.
Traditionally, the rulers in Denmark have been buried in the same place.
The King's House has today announced that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried in the Roskille Judgment Church, the court will state in its address on Thursday.
According to the BT magazine, this is because the prince’s dissatisfaction with his role in the King’s family is due to this.
It is no secret that the prince has been dissatisfied with his role and titles in the Danish Monarchy, the Head of Communication of the Court Lene Belleby commented on the newspaper.
The prince’s decision not to bury him next to his queen is a natural consequence of not being treated equally with his wife.
According to the court, the queen has long been aware of the wish of her mate to be buried and understands the decision.
The coolant on the road: The car was coming on the freeway.
There were two married and two little children on board.
They will not be injured in an accident, but they will not receive the money from the insurance if the other party is not sought.
The accident occurred at Keimolanport in Vantaa.
Archive image of the construction site of the Kehä III building site.
Vantalainen Tommi reports that his family survived on Tuesday by trade in a car accident.
Tommi, two little children of his wife Riina and the couple drove on a motorcycle at the Keimolanport in Vantaa towards Hämeenlinna.
A white car, which was supposed to drive the family to the side of the car, Tommi says, from the entrance to the Hämeenlinnäylä.
The atmospheric movement of the car would have been on top of the Tommin car.
I brake and turned the car at the same time, and it got out of hand, Tommi says.
The family's car hit the winds at a high speed.
The parents and the two little children in the back seat were not injured.
One of the children is under 3 years of age, the other is under 1 year of age.
Obviously, it was quite good luck when nothing happened to us.
No one in the past even drove us, even though there was a busy traffic in the place.
The accident occurred around 5.20 p.m.
In fact, no one stopped at them, and the family called the emergency centre.
They got out of the car by themselves.
The ambulance and emergency services staff arrived, and the condition of the family was reviewed.
The car went to ransom condition.
Tommi tells us that he and his wife have low incomes, and they received family aid for buying a car a couple of years ago.
Without another car, the family will not get the money from the insurance, according to Tom.
The family would like to see witnesses spotting the car, and the family would like to see it coming.
We need a car every day.
It's hard to drive children to the yard and work without it, Tommi says.
Tommi saw that the car was white, old car.
It was probably from the late 1990s or the beginning of the 21st century.
In his view, the beginning of the car number was SIG.
If we don't get caught, I don't know how we're doing economically, we're still going to have to count any cents today.
Tomi hopes that what happened or something you know is connected to the police.
The Eastern U.S. Police Department and the Central U.S. Rescue Department confirm that they have had an accident on Tuesday night at the scene of the accident.
The title and the case were corrected at 21.15: In contrast to what was said at the beginning of the case, the second car did not come to the welcome lane, but was driven from the acceleration strip to the side of the family car.
Lotta Jäppinen's proposal deals with human relations by humor - Self-discoverer Seed What? Theatre Friday and Saturday
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, brings his first-born guidance to what? theater.
The self-discoverer is a musical theatre presentation of misguided past human relations and insufficientness.
Director Lota Jäppinen said it would still be a good idea.
The subject is dealt with by the means of humor.
Old feelings don't stay out of debt, he says.
According to Jäppinen, a circular summer theater presentation has been made with a wide range of budgets and a large, young heart.
The name of the performance will challenge the question of what a person will expose himself to in his knowledge of the new person.
Is he playing a role or is he coming to another jacket door?
An unorthodox presentation combines the fact and the fictitiousness of the facts.
The rigid has both guided and dramatized the performance.
He also responds to the light.
The draft is made up of the text of the working group and it does not have a plan.
The director believes that even though the presentation draws young people's minds, it talks about all ages.
The rigid stresses that the self-discoverer does not actually tell us about his or her personal or working group's human relations.
Fact and fiction are mixed up.
My own world of values will certainly pass through the performance.
I don't think that relationships would be bad, but I also don't think that a relationship, especially a relationship, would be a lucky condition.
She learns from different parents from her parents.
Räppinen believes that the Self-discoverer will draw up a timely picture of young adults living in Finland in 100 years of age.
According to him, many people have learned a lot about human relations from their parents, many of whom have been separated.
At least it means that you have to listen to yourself.
You don't have to stay in a bad relationship.
The presentation is presented by Mina Lång, Niklas Rautén and Otto Rokka.
The working group also includes Ms. Ella Snllman, the Vice-President.
The music arrangement is Jäppinen and Roka.
The love of the theatre was lit in Kouvola.
Lotta Jäppinen, from Kouvola, 26, studies as director of theatre-expression at the Academy of Arts of the University of Applied Sciences of Turku.
It's two years back, and there's another mistake.
The icy enthusiasm for the theater has begun during the Kouvola years.
Growing up of music classes has been an assistant at the Kouvola Theatre and has performed, among other things, at the Student Theatre in Helsinki and most recently at the Castle Theatre in Turku.
The guidance has become more and more interesting.
The self-discoverer got his first night last week at Narri's stage in Helsinki.
In the future, at least a 45-minute-long-term proposal was also seen in Turku, the city of study in Jäppinen.
Self-discoverer in Kouvolan What? Theatre at 4.8 p.m. and 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. and 19 p.m. and 19 p.m.
For a year, the Finnish Olympic winner recovered from the horrific motocrossing accident - the neckline was broken.
Few athletes in Finland have the same unsustainable natural power as Janne Lahtela.
On the eve of the curvature, hundreds of days of a year toured the world for twenty years and chased his dream from the Olympics.
The dream took place in 2002, but Lahtela's movement continued.
He was not only an tireless trainee, but also a new kind of pilot.
There are not many sportes on earth that a chemical lake animal would not have tried at least once again.
It's been excited to practice.
There's always something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one hobby was to stop Lahela completely.
In 2014, Lahtela was hit by a Motocross accident.
Then her neck and both hands broke.
I wasn't working at all.
I've been working on wounds at my house for a year, says Rahtela.
The bay was bad luck.
He also acknowledges that age could have been a part of the process.
Driving a bike may sound a little shady.
But I didn't get the limits on it.
It's just a spore so hard, it's not enough for a 40-year-old like you to get too involved.
After the accident, Lahtela became in a special situation.
His busy life stopped like a wall.
It was a long time ago as the head coach of the Japanese freestyle team.
Lahtela started in the nest immediately after the end of her career in 2006.
For the first time since I was 15, I had to be there for the first time.
I didn't really do much of anything, Lahtela tells me.
Even during his training period, Lahtela often challenged her protection against slopes and physics tests.
Surprisingly, meeting was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so tired that I didn't seem to have any sense of my own.
Not even with the species.
It's good to be there.
I'm really enjoying it, because for the first time in a while I've just been out of it.
The mandatory break inspired Lahtela to become the main coach in Finland.
He's afraid he'll be burned out.
It's easier to find places that's broken down than they've ever been.
About the air accident, I never would have realized that I needed so much rest.
Lahtela started as a training team coach for Finland's freestyleland team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a safe hobby in place of the accelerators.
Change the motocrosses to the frisbegolofi.
I mean, that went right out of the lap right away.
At least, I was seven hours in a day, shaking.
Although Lahtela has always been an excellent trainer herself, she does not require her trainees to be the same as hers.
I will not force all of them into the same form.
In our natural world, there is an opportunity to be of our own nature and to be the way to become the best in the world.
Freestyle is a free style, and mentality has always been the same, says Lahtela.
Sex robots are coming and we need to be concerned.
It is here: a presentation of technological developments in the sex robotics sector – just as it had started to feel that 2017 could no longer become more important.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5 to 10 years.
"We must start to take seriously the proliferation of sex robots," says the founding member of the Foundation and professor at the University of Noel Sharpy Sheffield, professor of robotics and AI.
Customers can choose the colour of the dark eyes, the size of the nipples and the type of fingertips.
"Sex robots are being skided, but they are already sold quite a lot, and we will see them even more," Sharkey said at the release of the report.
Sexy dolls have developed from influxable dolls into robots with warm, sensitive silicone skin and artificial intelligence features that resemble human behavior.
The user can also adapt the robot to his own preferences from the colour of his eyes to the shape of the nipples and to the type and colour of the fingertips.
It is all the more important that robots have "personality" that makes the women of Stepford look like progressive freedom fighters.
Sexes have developed into robots with working skin.
For example, the characteristics of RealBotix robot can be adapted to the user’s preferences, perhaps shyness.
The Roxxxy Gold robots of the True Companion have pre-inspired personality: the Frigid Farrah seems shy, the Wild Wendy is adventurous and so on and so forth.
"The personality of Roxxxy Gold is as fully adapted as possible to the personality of the user", advertised on the company's website.
In other words, robot likes the same things as the user.
It also has different views:
It may perhaps be tired, chatty or "in a mood".
There are many worrying aspects of the proliferation of sex robots, which replace genuine human relations, but even more dangerous is the subjugation of women and direct rape dreams, as the user approaches, for example, a shy and anti-responsible designed robot.
The true Companion compares the Roxxxy robot with the vibrator on its website:
"Women have vibrators, why shouldn't men have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not just a fetist or a new sex toy.
Their generalisation and development tells us of something darker and deeper in our culture: the decline in gender equality towards sexual intercourse, where subjugation is one alternative among others.
The majority of men do not acquire sex robots, and their popularity is still marginal, even though the report by the FRR told us about their growing popularity.
However, magnetic phenomena mean much about the life of time.
And many start to behave quietly or easily only when the market permits it.
It is not a coincidence that sex robots have begun to become common at the same time as women's rights are under threat from all over the world and from the White House, the President, who has praised women who have been harassing them.
In the series The Handmaid's Tale (Orjattäresi), it is not the most worrying language for its strong image, for example, images of the hanging body and out of the dug eyes. The alarming thing is how realistic the world of the series feels.
The Republic of Gilead is far from our reality, but right now it seems to be a rather short distance.
Trying to make sex robots as much as technically possible, like real women (with regard to the proportion of porn stars).
The developers of the robots want their skins to feel genuine, and the movements are as good as possible following human movements.
However, their "personalities" are far from reality.
The robot cannot leave the relationship or the situation.
They do not have their own will or history — no violation of independence or the fantasy of complete surrender.
They're nice people. They're nice people.
A maid of service.
Suspects: Two terrorist acts were planned in Australia, a group led by Isis Chief of Isis.
The Head of Isis of the AFG led a group of Australian men suspected of taking a bomb designed to the aircraft of Etihad Airways.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, one of the leaders of the father had also sent a bomb of building parts to Sydney.
Suspectedly, the bomb was meant to be taken to the plane on 15 July, but the company interrupted before the security inspection was carried out.
The police are not going to tell us why the company was interrupted.
Another plan of suspected terrorists was to build a toxic non-coloured gas release device and to take the device to a public place, such as a public transport device.
Deputy Federal Commissioner Michael Phelan of Australia says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans ever made in Australia.
On the basis of the suspected terrorist attacks, four men were caught in police raids on Saturday.
One of the men has been released, but even his interrogations are being conducted.
The best of the best?
You'll get Mitt Romeney to look like the perire of common sense.
The same period has already been repeated to the satisfaction of the fact that the strong division of voters has also caused families to become divided at the daily level.
In the days of Christmas and Thanksgiving, the US newspaper’s advisory workshops provided guidance on how to deal with family members who have voted for the Olympics.
We all want to break our information bubble.
More than anything else, the ability of the Most High to unite families has been overlooked.
I'm telling you this because my cousin visited me this week in New York, and he's a left-wing poet in Chicago, who's long gone against the Republicans.
He recalled that the common enemy can have a strong combined effect.
Now that Trump is in the White House, all of my cousin's acquaintances – including the Republican provocative sister with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades – are suddenly and suddenly on the same side.
At dinner, it's a good thing, but, more generally, it involves significant risks.
Trump has given the left a new power, but the distorting effect of his presidential power can actually lead us all to the right.
When we talk about the Truth and the "normalization", we talk about the scary possibility that one day we will no longer be able to fear his tricks.
In the long term, there is even more horrifying possibility that Trump will normalise the Republics of the right border, which, compared to Trump, suddenly seem to be rational.
I look back on Mitt Romeney's deranged version of madness: dog on the roof, 14% income tax (and at least we've seen his tax returns).
After the end of the final term, the next presidential candidate of the Republics will have to be just sober, and it will feel like a significant improvement.
When my cousin was visiting me, we took our children to Central Park's carousel, which is the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best thing you can get in New York for $3 without caffeine.
The horses of the Rock are huge, the characters in the middle — the gruesome clowns and the animals looking back at the horrors — are evil, and the glamorous music behind the background is quite fascinating.
Many of the features of New York become disappointing over time: the prospects of high buildings start to get bored, the city's silhouette becomes too familiar with the city's reality and the city's reality does not match dreams.
And still, after 35 years, I have not been completely over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cabin, but a large traffic circle in North London. Ye Evere Swiss Cottage is a Swiss-like pub, but it is not counted.
On the other hand, the carousel of the centre park is still a magical experience — even to the extent that two two two-year-olds, one eleven-year-olds and two-four-year-olds enjoy a great deal of it.
I would have given Karus the perfect score if someone had asked for my evaluation, but fortunately no one came to ask questions.
Instead, I was asked this week in the store to estimate my "payment experience" on a scale of about five stars before I put my credit card in the numbering device.
The same thing at the cafe is in my neighborhood, but there I am also given the opportunity to combine 15% of the money in the evaluation when I go to the coffee counter myself.
This slows down the everyday interaction and pressures the client to put a person in a game where it is not necessary.
The department store salesman said that I was sorry that I gave five stars of my credit card to the user experience when I was tired of giving it to him.
Shefki Kuqi got fired from the Interstellar - "There was no total trust"
FC Inter has today released Shefki Kuq's team of representatives from the Society of the Shefki Kuq team the tasks of coaching the Shefki Kuq team.
The coaching officer will take on Fabrizio Piccare, who had previously worked as an assistant coach.
The other training team will continue to work as it is today.
Among other things, the Italian Piccareta has worked as an auxiliary coach in Sunderland, England.
In January, the 51-year-old Piccareta, who joined the Inter coaching team, has completed the UEFA Pro licence last year.
Stefan Håkans, Chairman of the Board of the FC Inter Board, is sorry about what happened.
Changing the coach is never an easy or pleasant task.
However, Shefki Kuq no longer had the trust of the management of the Society, where there was no other option at the moment, Håkans commented on the report of the Society.
The Piccreta Agreement is valid until the end of the period.
He and the other training team will be responsible as early as tomorrow's home trade against HIFK.
According to the evening report, the team has been hurling down on Thursdays all over the team.
Kuqi told the players on Thursday morning that the assistant coach Piccareta and John Allen had moved away from me.
Kuqi and Piccareta joined together during the Inter-Meeting with PS Kem last Saturday.
Linda Lampenius published a youthful picture from the '80s - would you identify a serious viola student?
Sculptor Linda Lampenius published a youth picture on Instagram.
A number of hysterical characters have been added to the photo, which suggests that the museum is a 16-year-old student of the Sibelius Academy of Sciences.
Lampenius himself wonders about a young woman who looks at a serious camera.
A long time ago, seriously, he will communicate.
If the picture is not visible, you can look at it here.
Lampenius has previously published pictures of his past and also talked about painful issues.
A year ago, he published an image of his own in Instagram.
In the second picture, he is seen 20 years ago, while the other one poses now, as the father of two children.
In his picture, Lampenius considered his own growth as a human and refers to eating disorders that he suffered from when he was younger.
One 20 years ago and today...
I still look a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but the difference is, I've learned to like myself and what I look like, Lampenius.
After the text he had added hashtags to English for life, eating disorder, uncertain, confidence, self-esteem, love, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, aging is cool.
Lampenius has spoken openly about his eating habits over the past years.
She was 14 years old in a hospital for anorexia and orthodox.
A little later, he also became sick of his bulimia, which eventually was discovered only in 2006.
The recovery began to begin to improve a little bit.
In addition to therapy and comparison, Lampenius helped new love.
The branch Pistorus was transferred from prison to a hospital for chest pain.
This is the second time that Pistorius was taken from prison to a hospital.
Last year he received hospital care for scars on his wrists, which according to the prison authorities he fell into a cell after he fell down.
He was convicted of murder following the prosecutor's appeal for the original murder conviction.
He killed Stenkamp in early hours in 2013 by shooting several shots through the W.C. door at home in the Pretoria.
Pisturus said he thought his girlfriend was a latent intruder who was hiding in the toilet.
The prosecutors have stated that they intend to appeal again, as they regard the judgment of the six years as too mild to judge by the Bishop.
The D.A. is going to appeal to South Africa's Supreme Court, and the complaint will possibly be dealt with this year.
If the appeal is accepted, the judgment of the Bishop may extend for 15 years.
The death penalty is not in use in South Africa.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece.
Two illegally encamped Bulgarians were arrested in Greece, reported the Ministry of Foreign Affairs according to the BTV channel.
The police arrested a group of unauthorised encamped people in Zion on the morning of August 1st of August. Two Bulgarians were among the campers.
They were released the same day, but the case will continue to be investigated.
According to the television channel bTV, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs later announced that it had released Bulgarians.
The Greek authorities have tightened up the rules on free camping areas and already provide significant fines to all those who encamp in areas other than those reserved for purpose.
The appeals shall be closed until the end of the period.
The Ministry announced that the right to impose a fine may be imposed on the right to impose a fine.
The liquid stock is sinking - already -7.7%
The share of the oil refiner Neste has risen by 7.7 per cent from about 11 o'clock.
Its profit before taxes was reduced, but exceeded the forecast compiled by the Inquire Financial.

Red meat, products and chocolate may relieve irritable bowel syndrome.
Red meat and chocolate may help the digestive system to smooth down.
However, the recent investigation claims the opposite: a diet containing a high level of meat protein and products may facilitate the development of irritant bowel syndrome.
Irritable bowel syndrome is an incurable illness that has affected about 1.3 million people in the United States and 300 000 people in the United Kingdom, causing stomach cramps, swelling, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.
However, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps the body to develop immune cells that strengthen its tolerance.
According to research director Marco Colonna, immune cells guard the bowels and ensure that harmful microbes in the food do not enter the body.
Cells that balance the cells that cause infections, which strengthen resilience, protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance falls too close to inflammation, it may result in irritable bowel syndrome.
Studies have shown that immune cells that enhance resistance are present in mice with a specific bacterial in the intestine.
This bacteria needs tryptophan to make immune cells appear. Tryptophan is one of the building materials of protein.
"We found a link between Lactobacillus reuter and development of cells that promote tolerance. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbial system in the intestine," says Professor Colonna.
"The more mouse pregnancy had a tryptophan, the more they had such immune cells."
If the same thing works in humans, a combination of Lactobacillus Reuter and a diet with a high level of tryptophan may enhance intestinal tolerance and reduce the susceptibility to inflammation.
In researching immune cells that strengthen resistance, researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barragan discovered that although one mouse group had such cells, they were not in mice of the same mouse species as the other group.
He suspected that the difference was related to the microbials in the intestines of mice, i.e. the community of gastrointestinal normal bacteria, fungi and viruses.
When the intestinal DNA of mice was investigated, six species of bacteria were detected in mice with immune cells but not in other mice.
When Lactobacillus Reuter bacteria were administered to sterile mice with no intestinal microbioms and no immune cells developed, these developed immune cells.
Researchers wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, who grew Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in water and transferred small amounts of liquids — without bacteria — into immature immune cells isolated from mice.
The immune cells developed into cells that strengthened resistance.
When the active ingredient was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a side product of the metabolism of tryptophan known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of tryptophan in mice' food, the number of cells proving tolerance increased by about 50%. When the number of tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half from the previous year.
According to Cervantes-Barragan, man has the same tolerance-enhancing cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our digestive tract.
It is not yet known whether the bacteria of Lactobacillus reuter are able to develop in humans the same way as in mice. However, genetic errors associated with tryptophan have been observed in patients with irritable intestinal syndrome.
"We probably want to promote the development of such cells because they regulate inflammation on the internal surface of the intestines," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"A high level of tryptophane combined with Lactobacillus reuter bacteria may contribute to their spread."
Jose Mourho said that, after he had signed an agreement with Nemanja Mat, he was in line with the "neron".
Jose Mourho believes that the "neron" in his line was awarded after the agreement with Nemanja Mati. The middle-level player debuted Manchester United in a row match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Mat began a 2–1 fight in Dublin, in the United States before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Tuesday. He was the defensive middle player against a star like Paul Pogban and Andreas Pereira.
However, Mati was not well yet, because she was not involved in the blue shirt tour of Asia before the beginning of the season. She did only 45 minutes in the field – according to Mourto, it must be changed before the start of the electoral period.
"He needs time, but his experiences, intelligence and thinking make him a genius – he has a natural sense of football," Mourinho says.
"We will help him to be ready rather than later."
In addition to Mati's newcomers, Victor Lindelof and the Reconciliation Luka was also starting a game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourho began to play for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho is still holding three new players, even though the others have already done a "excellent work" by acquiring three of his three players that he has given priority to.
"The three of the four – we must give thanks to each other for that," he added.
"I'm more pleased to have all four of them, but they did an excellent job."
Ballooners bullied Germany for two periods of time.
Finland's women's airfield team lost its fourth match of the World Cup tournament to Germany directly from 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The routine playing field is high.
The level of their game was in every sector, Finland's chief coach, Tapio Kangasniemi, reported on the bulletin.
In the first two episodes, Finland held its opponents under duress, but in the third part, Germany was clearly stronger than Germany.
The Germans lead the area.
When we played hard enough aggressively in certain places, we were able to swing along, Kangasniemi said.
Finland’s most effective had 14 points in collecting Pia Korhonen.
Three matches out of four lost Finland will meet Slovenia on Sunday.
Reuters: The grand jury has already sent challenges to Trump Jr's meeting in Russia.
In the United States, a large jury has sent challenges to Donald Trump Jr and to the meeting of Advocate General Natalia Veselnitskaja.
A large jury convened by D.A. Robert Mueller has already sent challenges to the meeting of Donald Trump Jr. and the Prime Attorney-General, Natalia Veslenniskaja, known for the Kremme Connections.
Report on this issue by the Press Office Reuters, which at the same time confirms the Wall Street Journal earlier Thursday’s announcement of the meeting of the grand jury.
According to Reuters, a large jury has sent challenges to a meeting between Trump Jr and Veselnitskaja, known for the Congolese contexts, which took place during the US Presidential elections in June 2016.
There were also Paul Manafort, then the campaign manager of Donald Trump Sr., and his sons-in-law, Jared Kushner, the current White House advisor.
According to Reuters’ sources, the fact that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a large jury in Washington, means that the pace of the Russian investigation is closer.
Sources add that Mueller wanted a large jury to assist in an investigation into Russia's involvement in the US presidential elections and whether or not Trump's campaign or in cooperation with Russia in the matter of Russia is being conducted by a large jury.
The grand jury extends the rights of Mueller to gather efforts, to challenge and to force people to testify on oaths.
A large jury is a group of ordinary citizens working behind closed doors.
The grand jury will consider the evidence found in the prosecution's investigation and decide whether the prosecution should be brought up.
The British inventor microsected himself to get home and into his car with a hand-in-hand glowing.
The first British inventor in the whole country has microcirculated himself so that he can open his house in the outer door, get into his office and start his car with a lightening hand.
The microchip is between the thumb and priority of Steven Northam, a 33-year-old, and now it provides services to companies and private individuals who want to facilitate their lives with the technology of the Northam BioTeq company.
The Northam will cooperate with Geoff Watson, an anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire Hospital Hospital of the District Hospital of Winchester, Hants, in order to meet the medical requirements for the installation of the microchip.
The microchip uses the same technique as the microchips of cats and dogs, and its installation takes only 30 seconds.
The North Seam company also makes the locks of houses and cars compatible with the microchip. One lock processing costs £300.
She's married and has one child, and she's installed microchip technology in both her home and her BMW Z4 car, which starts when she drops her hands on a wheel.
White House exhibition item cost thousands of dollars to taxpayers.
The last decision of the White House to fly a Navy helicopter to the southern lawn of the White House for an American production premier event came to pay taxpayers $24,000.
The Green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter is called Marine One when the President is on its way, which was a reference point in the White House on 17 July 2017 at the event in which American construction programmes were presented.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and a crowd of White House officials will have access to products from all 50 states.
In addition to the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut, the samples included, among others, a sailboat from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fur from Mississip.
The White House military office had only requested a helicopter with a specific mission order about 36 hours before its landing to the southern lawn "extraordinary" event, as shown by documents from the HMX-1 helicopter fleet of the Navy.
"I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of this because this is an exceptional event which will have a high level of visibility", the HMX-1 unit had written by e-mail the day before the event to its commander, who is Deputy Commander of the Navy Air Force.
The message told us that the helicopter would arrive at the southern lawn at the age of 17-7 at the morning and that the event would start at three o’clock. The helicopter would leave the place only after the lawnfield was evaporated between 6 and 9 o’clock at night.
In addition, the message noted that if the flight was delayed from the White House, another crew would be needed due to limitations in the flight time.
The original crew was on the helicopter during the time of the event, and the unit’s security staff were at the helicopter when it was on the ground.
It is not clear from the documents received by the Time magazine whether another crew was eventually required.
The U.S. Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using State property for political purposes.
According to the document, HMX-1 asked if the event was a violation of the law.
"One of us was whether this was a breach of the Hatch Act, and we were told that it would not be broken," wrote.
"It sounds like you can participate," replied Deputy Commander.
Made in America was the official event of the White House, so it was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events, too, have tones tones to the point.
At the event, the President spoke in favour of the health care reform at the time, which was discussed at the Senate, as well as of a looser state regulation.
The use of Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The Presidents must use them on their journeys,
but the use of them for photographs only is unusual.
In February, the more authentic actions were raised when Air Force One rolled behind the President's campaign in the state of Florida in Melbourne. Trump has criticised the use of his attacker's presidential plane.
"The White House is very pleased with Made in America, which introduced products from all 50 states produced by American workers from US materials," said the White House Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews carry out regular training flights in the Washington area and practice training in the southern lawn to bring the President to the White House to the White House in the nearest centimetres.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 training calculations for the White House.
According to one official, flights to Made in America were part of the crew’s monthly training licence.
The unit was also operated on helicopters that day for 11 hours on "non-presidential support missions".
According to the House of the House, no other costs were incurred by taxpayers for the event.
Sikorsky’s informant told us that the company was not involved in organising a helicopter presentation in the southern lawn of the White House.
HMX-1 does not have an account of flights related to its duties as President, and it is difficult to assess the costs of the event accurately.
According to the Ministry of Defence’s 2017 hourly compensation, the compensation for the VH-3D machine is USD 24 380 per hour.
According to HMX-1 documents, flights from the Land of Virginia to the White House from the Quantico base to the state of Virginia and took one hour to return.
According to the House of the House, the cost of operating the helicopter is clearly lower than the cost of operating the helicopter.
"The calculation of the costs for taxpayers by the level of compensation is misleading," Walters says.
"The estimated level of compensation shall include staff, maintenance and many other so-called costs, which shall be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to a study report by the RANDS in 2015, compensation levels do not include staff costs, but take into account fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
At the time of the event, the former White House Minister, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter in the event.
"The idea is to present American production," Spicer said.
"I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they are involved in ensuring national security and thus employmenting hundreds or thousands of people.
And I think that, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other defences for which many Americans have worked hard.
It is entirely appropriate to point that out."
It is not certain whether Trump visited the helicopter during the event, but at least he hit the fire truck driver's seat.
In the White House, Trump joked to the press about his own Sikorsky fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the President said. "I have three."
The lightning hit the Vaasan track - trains will be replaced by buses.
The passenger train traffic between the Seinäjoki and Vaasa is broken due to technical defects, reports the Traffic Centre.
The trains are replaced by buses for the time being.

The railway transport centre had not yet had an assessment of the duration of the repair in the afternoon.
The State Attorney of Venezuela is asking for the right to prevent the appointment of a new representative of the country.
The State Attorney of Venezuela has appealed for a court decision that would prevent the appointment of a new Parliament.
Mr Nicolas Maduro, President of Venezuela, has announced that last week's vote by the elected Parliament is due to be appointed on Friday.
In a controversial vote, a representative was elected to the country, which may, among other things, change the country's constitution.
According to Attorney General Luis Ortega, a decision on the prevention has been requested on grounds of suspicions of pecuniary fraud.
Ortega has also begun to vote on a survey of the practitioner.
He appointed two judges after the British firm that held the parliamentary vote told him that the results had been manipulated.
According to the company, the number of voters announced by the Venezuelan authorities was about one million higher than the number of real voters.
Only the Allies of Maduro were candidates for representation, and the representative of 545 members elected includes the son and wife of Maduro, among others, the son and wife of Maduro.
Apart from the amendment of the Constitution, the Congress, led by the opposition, may break down and amend laws by the Parliament.
Madroa was described as the dictator of Madroa.
The actions of the madrus have been widely condemned.
The opposition sees the amendment of the Constitution as a way of strengthening its position as a means of Maduro.
The United States has imposed sanctions on Maduro and called it a dictator.
The European Union, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Colombia and Argentina have, in turn, declared that they do not recognise the new representation.
Maduro claims that the new Parliament is the solution to the political and economic crisis in the country.
In Venezuela, restlessness has been going on for months.
They have wounded a number of people and have killed more than 100 people.
ozela was hit by the economic crisis when the price of oil fell.
Today, many people cannot afford food or medicines.
The opposition is also expected to agree on Friday, when the new delegation is scheduled to start.
He was sentenced to 4 years in prison in the United States of America.
On Thursday, in the United States of America, the Supreme Court sentenced Maxim Senah of 41 years of age to almost four years in prison for participation in a worldwide computer fraud.
It was also arrested in Finland in August 2015 following the United States' request.
According to the Russian newspaper Fontanka, Senah had been on vacation in Finland.
The Finnish border authorities arrested him when he was on his way home.
In February 2016, in spite of the protests by the Russians, Finland gave Senah to the U.S. Legal Service, reports AFP.
He was found guilty in March this year of computer fraud, which had benefited millions of millions of dollars.
Senah was sentenced to 46 months in prison.
According to the Ministry of Justice of the United States, Senah will be deported from the country after the execution of the prison sentence.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation was very serious about Finland after the arrest and said that no man should give up on the United States of America.
In the opinion, Finland and the United States were motivated by the fact that the arrest was carried out in Finland without Russia knowing in advance.
According to the D.A., Senah had been using a computer virus called Ebury that infected tens of thousands of computers around the world.
The virus used the virus to fish for usernames and passwords.
Swindlers then used information to further channel internet traffic, which was used to create clichés and post-posts.
According to the Director General of the Ministry of Justice, Kenneth Blanco, the case shows that the United States is also able to hunt other active cyber criminals.
We have the ability and the desire to identify, find and bring them to justice, Blanco told us in the bulletin.

Narcos's second production period trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of character, so the Cali cartel will head for the main part of the Netflix hit series.
Although Pablo Escobar's killer was discovered during the second production period in Narcos, the Netflix series is not over.
The direct hosting service has already confirmed that the third and fourth production season is seen from the series. The trailer of the second season is published and the second generation of frogs is included in the series.
During the production period below, the United States’ Narcotics Police Department has turned its attention to the Cali cartel, the world’s richest drug trade organisation in the world.
The four-gauge-led organisation acts as a "like a Fortune 500 company", except for the fact that there is a slightly higher number of donation and violence by public authorities.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is its head. Pacho Herrera (Alberto Amman) runs contacts with Mexico, and the Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the recently announced trailer Pedro Pascal is returning to Javier Peña, who is recruiting US and Colombian police officers for the war against drugs.
The new faces include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third production period of Narcos will start on 1 September.
Kari Kola undertakes an extraordinary light art work in Paris.
Joensuun light artist Kari Kola (in the picture) will perform an exceptional work of light in honor of the first Light Day of the United Nations in Paris next May of 16 May.
Kola is doing a light art work in Paris called Day and Night.
The work is done by light and darkness - day and night - eyes and moon.
The work illuminates the Fontenoy building at UNESCO headquarters and the Globe monument on its front.
In my work, I want to highlight not only light but also darkness.
Today, the city's light intensity is a major problem that affects the well-being of all of us.
With the help of my art, I can make the things that I have experienced concretely visible," explains the light artist Kari Kola about his work.
I am very pleased to be involved in the first international light day and bring light to light as part of the working day, Kola continues.
Kari Kola was present during the opening of the Light Year in 2015, when he would illustrate the anniversary in honor of the Unesco headquarters.
I feel very privileged to be able to execute my art again at UNESCO headquarters, Kari Kola says.
The work may still expand seriously.
We will report on this later during the autumn, Kola will continue.
The purpose of the International Light Day is to highlight the importance of light for mankind and to raise people's awareness of the areas of science, art, culture and sustainable development.
First Light Day will be celebrated at UNESCO headquarters in central Paris on 16 May.
Two men fighting two men at the mall's parking garage in Espoo, Espoo.
Two men had an argument in Espoo with a shopping center in the Grand Omena Park Hall on Wednesday afternoon.
According to the parties, the dispute began when the other party accidentally drove into the forbidden driving direction.
There was an oral dispute between drivers.
A driver driving a forbidden driveway would attract another car driver, which would result in this car going off and hitting the hitter's car.
After that, he hit the plane of another car that hit the plane.
In a preliminary discussion, the man has stated that he has caused an accident and has done it wrong.
The article entitled "Then came the flood of water" by Soin, entitled "Possible Soin".
On Thursday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Souni (v. ) published a post with a question mark on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The article is short, only two sentences in length.
During my time, the party counted from zero to thirty-seven members of the Government of the Government.
Then came the flood, now everything bells, Soini writes.
The text of Soin contains references to France in the 17th century.
The comparison of King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, is known to have been used by the flood comparison.
Depending on the interpretation, history's books are left with "the flood of water after us" or "the flood after me".
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women.
Elections shall be representative only if they allow all members of society, including women, to vote, said the Head of the UN delegation in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Ms. Nicholas Haysom, interim director of the UN mission to assist, noted that hundreds of women are candidates for the municipal elections, three women are looking for Vice President and more than 30% of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overemphasized", Haysom said in his opinion on Wednesday.
Elections can only be genuinely representative and credible if women participate fully in them and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
The parliamentary and presidential elections in the province of Afghanistan shall be held on 5-17 May.
The Taliban has made threats to the elections at the same time as the international forces are moving into an advisory role.
This year's elections will be the first time that power moves from one government to another in a peacefully democratically-elected manner.
Haysom said that women's contribution will strengthen Afghan democracy.
According to the independent Afghan electoral board, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

The flood of certain types of tourists poses a threat to the region’s culture.
The authorities are expected to limit the number of tourists in Venice.
In particular, it is the form of tourism represented by cruise ships.
The Italian Minister of Culture calls it "eat and fleee" tourism: there are only a few hours in the site and a lot of people are rushing through the sights.
Russia has been suffocating its fast day trips to tourism in the city.
It is difficult to move on the streets and the fine squares are so full of visitors that the inhabitants of Venice are no longer able to fit in.
They have been forced to move further and further away from the historical center, while hotels have been replaced by homes.
The New York Times and The Guardian write about the problems of tourism in Venice.
The authorities intend to make a reference to the tourist price.
They call the present phenomenon a bad type of tourism - low-quality tourism.
When arriving on a large cruise ship, the time will be two or three hours.
You will follow the ticket guide to the bridge at Romalta Rialto and St. Mark's Square, and turn back, describes the presence and problems of the Italian Minister of Culture Drio Franceschini, Italian Minister of Culture.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operations of the place, shops and workshops.
We need to keep this part of the town identity.
The Holy Mark's history is also one of the most popular attractions of the historic centre in Venice.
The Church of Saint Mark is located on the side of the market.
Local anger, too, is mainly directed at cruise ships.
There are only 50,000 locals living in the historic centre of the region.
In 1951, the number of inhabitants was approximately 15,000.
In July, approximately 2 000 Russians expressed their views on mass tourism.
According to them, tourism has weakened their quality of life, destroyed the environment and driven the inhabitants away.
Some 2,000 people leave each year.
If this goes on, after a few years in Venice, there will be no more than tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, says Carlo Belframe, who organized the demonstration.
The ring is difficult because the ships are bringing their hard-needed income to Venice and creating a need for a number of jobs in different sectors.
In addition to limiting the volume of trade, the solution is envisaged to allow cruisers to go further than the historic centre.
In the opinion of Luciano Bortot, a member of the Union, it would certainly change the situation if the Venetian administrative area, where Venice is located, had more power to decide on its own matters - if not full autonomy.
Around 20-30 million tourists visit the village every year.
Are you driving towards Kuopio?
On the road, bad miles of traffic traffic on the road.
On the motorway between Kuopio and Siilijärvi northwards, there has been a traffic jam from Thursday afternoon to Thursday afternoon at the time of return traffic.
In the area we are working on road coating work, which slows down traffic, says Savo Sanomat.
There is a 50 km/h limitation on the work instead of the usual 120 km/h.
However, traffic in the 50 km restricted area had moved forward in the nearest Thursday afternoons, however, practically by walking speed.
The works went ahead on Thursday afternoon on the side of Lake Siilinjärvi in relation to the image of the Revelation, or gold oats.
I'll get along well without that kind of attention.
A 23-year-old runner has found out about the public curses.
Amalie Iuel has published wonderful images of herself, among others, in the lands of the Grand Canyon.
Amalie Iuel, a Danish-Norwegian, has become a popular athlete in his current home country, Norway, not least because he broke the 26-year-old Norwegian record in March on a 400-metre run running around the track at 51.81.
A month later, he improved 400 meters of the cone running at the time of the Norwegian record on May 55th.
Iuel, who was using the social media, soon after his record, noticed that fame and publicity had their backs.
Men around the world began to send Iuel the images of his sex body, apparently in the hope that the young runner would be interested in them.
Iuel was forced to close off from outside his Snapchat account.
I got a lot of "scoffs" from unknown people, so I had to move my account into private, and I told the VG newspaper.
In an interview with VG, Iuel did not want to identify exactly what kind of image he received.
You know, Iuel's laughing, I guess.
It's nice to get feedback after the run, but I'll get along well without that kind of attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark in 1994.
Her mother is Danish, her father is Danish-Norwegian.
The Iuel family moved to Norway with Amalie 2 years of age.
When the Amals were 12 years old, the parents first moved to Namibia, then Pakistan, because of their work.
Then, Dubai, Thailand and the United States were in turn.
Iuel spent four years as a university athlete in Los Angeles, where he returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Danish citizenship to Norwegian citizenship.
In Norway, Iuel is training at the top of the three trainers Leif Olav Allnes, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Slettum.
There is a lot more than there is in the United States of America than there is in the United States.
Coaches in the United States don't ask for anything, just give orders.
In Norway, the coach has much more time to personally deal with the athlete, Iuel told VG about VG.
Amalie Iuel holds Norwegian records at 400 metres and 400 metres in the runway.
The pedestrian took Janne Korven's entire career into the line of risk - now he's involved in the MMs: "It's nice when it doesn't happen."
Now it's been nice to count when nothing's happened.
Janne Korpi, 31, which is one of the most successful snowboarders in Finland, has actually started to enjoy a loved one again during this period.
Last summer, the career's career was at stake.
The injury of the foot table had forced Korve to the cutting table in January, and the leg did not want any improvement.
The hand had also been hit by a racer.
In the summer, I didn't know what I was doing, whether it's a ride or not.
The sponsories were broken and a lot of things were open, Korpi says.
Well, that's what they say, things tend to work out.
The leg healed, the sponsor continued the contract for two years, and the blood started again pulling on the slope.
The extension decision was then easy to make.
I knew it at the very least when I first came to visit you on purpose.
I was thinking, damn it, though, this is so much fun, we're gonna have to pull it over a couple more times.
The corpus began to count properly until September-October, but after a long landing, just a painless exercise has been a big deal.
Korpi has only been around a few games.
It's okay. It's okay.
Competitions have never been the most important aspect of the market for the Korvel.
I've never dropped for a race.
I think it's urgent to start four years in one race, and then you'll be hot for that week.
I can't help thinking that, Korpi says.
Today Korpi's competition is held at the half-pipipe of the World Cup held in the Spanish Sierra Nevada.
Even though certain races don't keep him on board, he always gets lit up when he's in a race with a real hard-on.
According to the basket, the value of the international skiing union's competitions has increased over the past few years, although some of the platformers have both selected Norwegian X-Games at the same time.
Yes, these are important competitions, the view is large.
True, in my opinion, the value always depends on the circumstances and level of the competitions.
Korpi is the oldest athlete in Finland’s 12-person team in Sierra Nevada.
Team falls, 17-year-old Rene Rinnehedrohed and Emmi Parkennime, are older than the Korpea 14-year-old.
It's nice to follow up on your younger friends.
I remember when you were at the point where everything was new and you were so excited about everything.
It'll bring new power to itself, too, Corpi thinking.
I'm still stuck with something, but otherwise I don't, it's the same thing that's running around my friends.
On the back of the holiday career, Janne Korpi has also built a different sport course.
The son of the director legend Pekka Korve is connected to the sport of entertainment: the air carrier has his own horse of health for whom he does training programs.
As long as I'm on the road all the time, there's no need for it to be in the fair anymore.
But every day at least I look at the results of the meal and usually something about the departures, Korpi says.
Management and training are according to Korven as a potential career plan when the breeding career is completed.
I'm not planning that far now, but it's probably an alternative.
I feel that it is a little bit as if I were to learn it here, besides snow marketing.
I'm trying to get a little nervous and better. In summer, maybe you'll be driving something, too.
If that's my future job, then it's not hard to start when you're already inside the field.
Treatments also include the event manager Jaajo Linnomaa, an Eltloppet ravirization with Eltloppet.
The week has rented a cruise ship heading to the Stockholm Elitloppet treatment competition at the end of May.
The Corps and Linnonmaa decided to reinvigorate the old tradition.
Rising has gone well for sale, and people have been excited about it.
We're already at the point where there's not going to be any bankruptcy.
A few months longer, I hope to complete the ship, Korpi says with enthusiasm.
Annando's nursing home project for Kite has all of it surprisingly been done.
Mr Ester is the name of a new nursing home for 41-person elderly people built in Kite.
The building will be completed next summer on the other side of the health centre next to the health centre.
The general topic of wonder is the need for a new service to be provided by customers, as now, during Siu's time, many private clinics are failing customers.
Anne Flink Händosta, Executive Director of Health Services, commented that in future there will be more demand for Kite not only for options but also for enhanced service housing.
There is a need for a wide range of services, and when there are alternatives, even freedom of choice works better, Flink says.
Last year, Lindo bought private nursing homes from Kite in Kanervikkkola and Eerika.
Dealing business, but the properties are known to be a five-year lease.
Flink says that Athlno has no acute need to move operations away from these facilities.
More about this later today.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of McVitie's brand in Scotland's factory.
The trade union is seeking confirmation from McVitie's cookie manufacturer's directors of the long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow factory.
According to the Scottish department of the General Trade Union of the United Kingdom, the company has not informed us of its plans for the future of the Tollcross factory.
Hobnobs and Rich Tea have over 500 employees at the factory manufacturing cookies and other products.
The company that owns the McVitie's brand, Pladis, reported that he invested in the factory over five million pounds in recent years.
The company added that employees and trade union representatives "will definitely be "in the first place" in case of changes in their activities.
In his letter to the CEO, GMB invites the company "to take care that no financing has been provided for the modernisation of production lines.
Drew Duffy, the GMB trade union, considers it very important that the factory manager is not informed of the needs of Tollcross's business and future investment plans.
"The families have worked here from generation to generation, and the workforce has been heavily concentrated in the local community and the metropolitan area of Glasgow, which is an important employer in the area of high unemployment and poor income.
From the point of view of jobs, wages and income, as well as of Brexite, rising cost of living and continuing reduction in production, East Glasgow needs a successful production of McVitie's."
According to the press release, the President had not received a letter from the trade union until the day before, and the company will respond directly to the letter because it appreciates the continuous interaction between employees and trade union representatives.
"We had a regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB at Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed several issues openly.
We discussed with employees, among other things, the fact that, like other companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain market, we assess all our transactions and services in a continuous manner, in order to preserve our competitiveness."
According to the press, the company has invested more than GBP 5 million in the Tollcross factory in recent years, especially in its production lines and in improving its operations.
"We are aware of Tollcross's long history as a production plant and will certainly be the first to tell employees and trade union representatives if we are to make changes to the factory's operations."
Did PSG warn about the transfer of Barcelona Neymar three years ago?
LaLiga may regret his interest in Marco Vertra.
Paris-Germain will not give up Neymar's pursuit of the termination of the agreement for a sum of GBP 189 million, but did PSG warn La about a record transfer three years ago?
Sensational transfer is the most spoken case in the summer. The French Ligue 1 football series team is ready to break the world record of transfers. Previous record was less than half: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to the United States with a sum of GBP 89 million.
After the transfer, Neymar will be the world's most expensive observer and also the world's best-paid professional athlete, as PSG will provide him with more than £500 000 per week after taxes.
The source near Barcelona tells us that the company has taken very good care of Neymar since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Did the President of the PSG warn the world about this transfer three years ago?
When City announced that it was interested in Blase Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif warned the PSG about the best players to target.
"I'm not worried, because they know that if they seek our players, we will be their opponent and we will contact their players," Al-Khelaif said.
"We respect all the groups.
But if they seek our players, they will face the consequences."
This is exactly what Barcelona seems to have done: it expressed interest in the PSG’s middle-level player Marco Compared earlier this summer.
The PSG makes it clear that it would not allow an Italian to leave under any circumstances. It may well be that Barcelona is leaving for this reason its star player Neymar.

N.Y.I.: The calls from the Trump were invented - the White House's editor: "I wouldn't say it was a lie".
The White House admits that two calls from President Donald Trump, the United States President of the United States, never happened, says the New York Times.
Calls made by both the President of Mexico and the leader of the patrol organisation have proved to be invented.
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the public official of the house, confirmed that no calls had been made.
He said that Ómp did not lie.
According to Sanders, many of the patrol leaders spoke to Trump personally, and Trump and the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto had discussed with Trump at the G20 meeting in Hamburg.
I wouldn't say it was a lie, it's a pretty bad accusation.
The discussions took place, they just didn't happen on the phone, they happened on the phone.
Talking to the patrols was an agitating reaction.
On Monday, Trump told me that the Mexican President called him and said, "I'm sorry, Mr. Trump's successful illegal migration was solved."
According to the Final Report, Pena Nieto told us that few more come across the Mexican border because they know that they are going to miss the U.S. border anyway.
On Wednesday, the Mexican government published a newsletter in which it said that this call had not been made.
On Tuesday, Politico published a complete version of his interview with The Wall Street Journal.
There Trump was quick to speak at a large meeting of the National Anti-Science Organisation in West Virginia.
I got a call from the police chief, he said it was the most wonderful speech they've ever had.
They were very grateful, Trump told me.
On Wednesday, the Security Officers' Association informed them that it was not aware of the call made by any of its directors to the Trump.
According to the press, the former statement by Michael Surbaughi, Director of the Organization, in which he had apologized to the Scouts for his speech, speaks on his side.
A fine speech at the meeting of the Security Organisation raised a lot of ambiguity, as it was exceptionally political in relation to the nature of the event.
He, among other things, glowed the results of last autumn's presidential elections.
