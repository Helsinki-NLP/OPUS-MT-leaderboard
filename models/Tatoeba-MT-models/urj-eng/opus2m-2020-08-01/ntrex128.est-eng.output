The members of the Wales National Assembly fear that it will look like Muppets.
Some of the members of the National Assembly have been delighted by the recommendation to convert their title to the СP (member of the Welsh Parliament or Member of the Wales Parliament).
The theme has begun to transform the name of the National Assembly into Wales Parliament.
Representatives of all political trends at the National Assembly are concerned that this could lead to a laughter.
One member of the National Assembly, a member of the assembly of campers, said that his group associates were concerned about it, because it was ruffled by the words “Twp and Pwp”.
For an explanation of readers outside of Wales: the loud word daft means napka and pwp means poop.
A member of the panel said that the whole group "is not happy" and has proposed other names.
Mr Wales's Member of the Conservative Party said that his group would view the change in name as "approachable", but would point out that the word "MWP" is very similar to the word "Mukät".
To explain: the letter w is a pronunciation similar to that of the Yorkshire English language.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting a draft law on the amendment of the name, said: "The final decision on all the names to which members of the National Assembly are invited will, of course, be taken by the members themselves."
The Law of 2017 of the Government of Wales gave the Wales National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals for names, which widely supports the idea of re-designing the National Assembly as the Wales Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the title "Wales Member or WMPs", but the participants in the public consultation supported the most variant "MWP".
The Members of the Assembly are likely to put out other names, but reaching an agreement may be a challenge for President Elin Jones, who should submit a legislative proposal on amendments in the coming weeks.
The reform will also include other changes to the working principles of the National Assembly, including the rules for the exercise of the rights of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the Committee system.
The final vote on the appointment of members of the National Assembly shall be left to Members during the debate on the legislative act.
The Macedonians are holding a referendum on changing the name of the country.
On Sunday, the voters will vote to name their country "Northern Macedonia".
The purpose of the referendum is to resolve the long-standing dispute with the United Kingdom of America, which has its own country, for decades.
Athenia has long argued that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim for that territory and has repeatedly objected to candidates for EU and NATO membership.
The President of Macedonia, Mr Gjorge Ivanov, against the referendum on a change of name, has said that he intends to ignore the vote.
However, voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zajev, claim that the change of name is only the price that a country would pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The Watches of the Holy Father remain silent because the Churches of Harlem are struggling with difficulties.
“The older people I’ve been talking to have said that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner, ” said Mr. Adams.
"No one is any more."
He said that the loss of bars was understandable.
“The people today communicate differently,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people are present every day."
However, as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, and “they will return sooner or later. ”
Adams added that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with flats full of people who do not pass the help of the rest of the neighborhood's churches.
“The vast majority of those buying dwellings in these buildings are white,” he added, “who therefore urges the arrival of the day when all these churches close their doors because it is unlikely that most of the people who live here will become members of these churches.”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan Community, built in 1870, the Church of Saint Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodists congregation left in the 19th century.
The church of the blacks, who had so far worshiped God, took over the property rights of the building.
The Afro-American community in the Church of St. Martin was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott against the shoppers of the main shopping street 125th Street in Harlem, when they refused to hire or promote black people.
In the 1939 fire, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson’s members planned to rebuild the building, they introduced a pool, or clock game.
Father Johnson’s son and his secretary at St. Martin’s Church, Reverend David Johnson called the billion with pride “the bells of the poor. ”
In July, however, the expert who played the Carlion gave this another name: "cultural value" and "independent historical instrument".
The expert Tiffany Ng Michigan from the University noted that this is the world's first syllion, played by a black musician, Dionio A. Lind, who continued to play a larger syllion at the RISITE church 18 years ago.
Mr Merriweather said that the Church of Saint Martin did not replace him.
The performance in the Church of St. Martin in recent months has been a story of architects and contractors, some of whom have been accompanied by the secular leaders of the Church, the other bishops.
In July, a congregation governing body, which is composed of secular leaders, complained in writing to the bishop's family in July that the bishop's household "is trying to pass on the costs", although the term of office did not even have to do with the hire of architects and employees from the bishop's office.
Some members complained about poor transparency in the actions of the bishop community.
The shark injured a boy dived into 13-year-old lobsters.
According to the authorities, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who dived into the lobsters on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before seven o’clock in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he had been diving with his friends about half an hour this Saturday morning when he heard the boy's screams and then he went to the others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that he initially thought that the boy expressed his enthusiasm for getting the lobster, but “he realized then that the boy shouted, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!"
Hammel described what he saw when he reached the boy.
“I cried all of them to come out of the water: “The shark is in the water,” Hammel added.
In a life-threatening situation, Rady was taken to the hospital in San Diego by plane.
The species of the attacked shark is not yet known.
At the press conference, the lifeguard and Captain Larry Giles said that sharks had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but then it was established that this was not a dangerous species of sharks.
Giles added that the injuries to the victim were at the top of the body.
The authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Ecinita for 48 hours for research and safety purposes, from Phodo Beach to Swamini, from Photo Beach in Ecinitas.
He added that there were more than 135 sharks in the area, but most of them were not considered to be dangerous.
Saisbury's plan is to take over the power of the United Kingdom's market for beauty products.
Sainsbury's takes over the Bits, Superdrug and Debenhams chains, creating a wide range of brand-like trades for beauty products, which also employ experts from experts.
As part of the major penetration into the UK market of GBP 2.7 billion, which, as sales of fashion and home goods fall, continues to be on the move, the wider range of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores all over the country, taking them into account, if successful, in other stores next year.
Investing in furniture products is because supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space previously provided for TVs, microwave ovens and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that it was planning to double its range of beauty products up to 3000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr PawPak.
Existing product options from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bes are also given more space in brand areas like those currently found in Boots’ stores.
The supermarket also resells its makeup product series  Boutique, where most products are suitable for vegans, as young buyers increasingly demand more and more.
In addition, Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer, will test the exclusive authorisation of two Saisbury's shops, the first opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham this year.
Online shopping and the switch to the daily purchase of small food from local food stores means that pre-markets must seek more to persuade people to visit them.
The CEO of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe, has said that sales outlets are becoming increasingly similar to supermarkets because the supermarket chain is trying to fight against cheap sales such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and goods.
Sainsbury's has put Argos' sales in hundreds of stores, and the same has been done with Habitatsi's sales, since Sainsbury's bought both chains two years ago, which allegedly supported the sale of food goods and made the acquisitions more profitable.
Supermarket's earlier attempt to renew its departments of beauty and medical products ended with failure.
Sainsbury tested the joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended with an outcry on how to share the proceeds of the sale of pharmaceutical goods in supermarkets.
The plan was designed after Sainsbury's sold its 281 sons to the pharmaceutical business three years ago for GBP 125 million to Celesio, which includes the entire Lloyds Pharmacy trade chain.
Lloyds also plays a role in the strategy by including luxury leather products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vary, in the product range of its four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, CEO of Sainsbury's, said: “We have changed the appearance and nature of our trade in beauty products in order to improve the environment that surrounds customers.
We have also spent money on staff who have received special training and who are always willing to advise.
Our choice of products meets all the needs, but attractive environments and comfortable locations mean that we are now a competitive destination for trade, which can change old shopping methods."
Peter is angry at you because Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of transaction.
Dragons Den's star Peter left "roughly" when the broadcaster Holly Willoughby gave up 11 million pounds of transaction in his life goods business to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughbyl lacks time for a home goods and clothing trade fair for real.
The pari business is likened to Gwyneth Palt Loop brand Goop.
The director of a 37-year-old television show called "This Morning" reported his departure in Jós.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den's star Peter Boo inside out of the wrath of Peter, stepping out of their luxury life goods trade at the last minute to focus on his new successful contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Well, the sources told me that Jones was a "married" when the star girl in the TV admitted at a tight meeting that took place on Tuesday at Marlows Buckinghamshire, headquarter of the business empire, that her new contracts of GBP 1.5 million means that she doesn't have enough time to devote herself to the home clothing and clothing store Truly.
The business is likened to the Goo brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and it was believed that it would regularise Willoughby's estimated GBP 11 million worth of assets.
When Willoughby, 37-year-old, reported that he was leaving Truly, he left the UK for one of his vacation homes.
One source said: “Truly certainly was Holly’s main priority.
It had to secure her long-term future, so she thought she would be working on it for the next few decades.
His decision to leave left everything in total amazement about the matter.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday because it was so close to placing the product series on the market.
There is a warehouse in Marlow headquarters, which is full-bodied goods."
Experts believe that the departure of one of the most paid reputations from the TV broadcast “This Morning” can cost millions of dollars to the company because of the fact that products that are selected from couches and candles to clothing and household clothes are invested in the money in a box, and may also be accompanied by a later placing on the market of the product.
This could mean the end of a long time's friendship.
Willoughby and his wife Dan Baldwin have been close to Tara Capp for ten years with her mother, Willoughby, and her wife, Dan Baldwin.
Willoughby created a trade union with Oury and Capp in 2016. A 52-year-old joined the trade union president in March.
Couples go on holiday together and they have 40% participation in Baldwin's company.
Willoughby becomes an M&S brandy and he replaces Ant McPartlini ITV in the TV series I'm A Celebrity.
One of the close sources of the hunt said last night: "I don't want to comment on his business."
The conversation of trouble, "why do we fall in love with each other?"
Trump used to joke over the criticism that was directed at him in the news for a comment that someone considered to be “indignant to the President” and overdoing the credibility of the North Korean Head of State with regard to the North.
Why has President Trump abandoned so much?
Trump said his word with the word of a word called "republicary anchor":
"I haven't given up on anything."
He noted that Kim is after Trump welcomed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's abandonment of nuclear weapons, interested in the second meeting.
But negotiations for nuclear non-proliferation have stopped.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, the North Korea Summit of the World Leaders Ri Yong Ho said to the world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see the United States' "compatible reaction" to the initial disintegration steps in North Korea.
He pointed out that the United States would continue to pressurise the country today.
A more pleasant conversation point of view was a much more enjoyable one.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“North Korea was starting a war.
Millions of people would be dead.
"We're fine now."
He said that his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim have produced good results: the tests on missiles have been completed, it has helped release hostages and it has been organised to bring the preserves of the officials of the United States of America home.
He also defended his unusual communication with Kim.
“It is very easy to be a President, but instead of letting 10,000 people wait outside for access to this full-blown stadium, it is better that we have nearly 200 people here,” said Trump, pointing to the crowd standing before him.
The tsunami and earthquake will destroy the island of Indonesia, killing hundreds of people.
In the event of the outbreak of the Lomboki earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lomboki population had to be relocated, a national disaster was not declared a prerequisite for obtaining international aid.
“They have often made it very clear that they do not want international aid, so the stories are a little complicated, ” said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Organisation Save the Children brings together a team to go to the Request, it is not clear whether foreigners can work in the area.
Mr Sutopo, the Press Representative of the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in the Request for a decision on whether international authorities are allowed to contribute to the assistance.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, the state has, by far, little prepared to deal with power.
Although asylum for the tsunami has been built in Aceh, they are not very common in other rural areas.
Although a warning was given about the tsunami, the appearance of the siren appearance of the tsunami warning was likely to increase the number of deaths requested.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is also quite challenging in the best of times.
Natural disasters make it even more complex in its logistics.
The hospital ship that has stopped to cure the victims of the accident in Lombo is heading to the Palace, but it will take at least three days to arrive at a new accident.
President Either Widodo has transformed Indonesia's split-up infrastructure into a central part of his election campaign and has distributed money on roads and railways.
The deficits, however, threaten Mr. Joko's government, as the elections will stand next year.
Also, Mr. Jokot, in Indonesia, is under pressure from the tensions of the dissidents, where members of the Muslim community in the majority have turned to a more ancient form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands left their homes because of the fights between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.

"I saw Kante coming, I made one touch, and I gave him a more thoughtless blow."
At the end of the first half, Chelsea 1 : 0 was led by the 25th quarter of the 27th quarter by the Gem.

The shape of Parliament Cromwell is the last monument, which is the cause of the "transformation of history" dispute.
Taking it away would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in the Taliban style by man’s inhuman cowards.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's recommendation as a stupidity and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the recent debate on the creation of images, it was impossible to defend the monument in front of the Westminster Palace of Cromwell.
Cromł did not rob pictures of the English civil war itself, nor did he tell others to do so.
Perhaps the false Cromwell man’s ancestor was sacrificed for the actions of the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent presentation of Cromwell is proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historical description of the person who many people believe should still pay tribute."
HH Goldsmith said to the newspaper The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people thought more of the 19th at the end than today the Cromwell Parliament was a protector of external pressure and, in this case, of the rule.
Whether this is an accurate statement is an infinitely historic dispute.
The fact is that the quarrel between the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell clearly represents this gap on one side.
His achievements as the Master Keeper also deserve celebration and recollection."
With a fun pig, he was killed by a Polish farmer.
According to local media reports, in the south-west China market, a pig was attacked by a pig that killed a man.
A man who was identified with only a last name Yuan was found dead and covered in blood with injured artery near the Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, reported the South China newspaper "Morning Post" on Sunday.
The production of the officer on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai province, China, for vaccination of pigs in their barns in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
Supposedly, he had come to Sannan, a neighboring province with his cousin on a Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the husband’s cousin found out that he was dead and found out that the next lantern was open.
He said that the sculptor was cocky with a big bloody mouth.
The case-law investigation confirmed that 249,47 kilograms of stilt had been reported to have mutilated by the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were all bloody and crushed,” reported cousin Wu’s words in the newspaper “Guyang Evening News”.
Security camera records showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday morning at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The husband’s dead animal did not belong either to Yuan or to his sister.
The president told Evening News that the pig was locked up so that he wouldn't be able to attack anyone else until the police gathered evidence on the occasion.
The Ukrainian family and market leaders are claiming to pay compensation for the death of a man.
Often, however, it has been observed before that pigs attack people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm.
Ten years earlier, the pig weighing 294,83 kg nailed the farm tractor of the Welsh farmer until the man's wife scared the animal away.
When in 2012, when one of the Oregon farmers ate his own pigs, one of the Manitoba farmers told CBC News that the pigs would usually not attack, but because of the taste of blood, it might hurt their heads.
“They’re just a toy.
They're a very curious marakrat who's not meant to hurt.
You just have to respect them enough," said the man.
The winds of the hurricane Rosa bring large rainheads to the southwest of the United States of America.
It is predicted that the hurricane Rosa will be weakened by moving across the north coast of Mexico towards cooler waters.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainfalls flooding over North Mexico and the Southwest of the United States.
On Sunday afternoon at 05:00, the time of the East Coast was classified by Rosa 136,78 km/h as a first-class hurricane, located 619, 59 km/h southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to be heading north on Sunday.
In the middle of the Pacific, there will be a low-level environment moving eastwards towards the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches a tropical storm on Monday to the Baja California Peninsula, it will start to direct a deep tropical humidity towards the southwest of the United States.
On Monday Rosa will arrive to Mexico, where it will rain up to 25,4 cm [25,4 cm] of rain.
Then, in the coming days, the tropical humidity, which is responding to the approaching low climate, will create a large amount of strong rain discharges in the south-west part of the country.
At this point, the rains of rain poured between 2.54 and 10,16 centimetres cause dangerous floods, flood water and potential explosives in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes an increase of 5 to about seven and a half centimetres per hour, especially in the south-west of Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected that rainfalls of between 5,08 and 10,16 cm in certain areas of the south-west of the United States, especially in Arizona, are expected to take place in certain areas of the south-west of the United States.
The floods are possible because of the dispersal of tropical rains with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It should certainly not move on foot in the desert in the event of a warning of tropical rainfall.
Sturdy rain canyons can turn into high-speed rivers and thunderstorms in some places caused by explosive winds and volatile dust.
The approachable climate sometimes leads to fierce rainfalls in the southern part of California.
The total amount of rainy rainy plants that extends over 1,27 centimetres and may cause smaller flood water and smooth roads is possible.
This would be the first rain of the area during the rain period.
The reduced tropical rainfalls begin to approach Arizona on Sunday afternoons and Monday mornings, rainfalls become long Monday afternoons and Tuesdays.
The strong rainheads reach the Four Corner on Tuesday and remain until Wednesday.
In October, the United States is forecasting great temperature fluctuations due to the cooling of the Arctic, while in tropical areas the temperatures remain high.
Sometimes it causes great weather changes in small areas.
The day-to-day weather represents an excellent example of significant temperature differences in the central part of the United States of America.
The temperature differences between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa) range to almost 20 degrees.
In the next few days, a long summer heat will try to collect itself again.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States of America are expected to be warm in early October with a wide range of 80 degrees of heat around the world from the southern highlands to the northeast of the country.
New York is expected to have an average of 26,6 hot wires, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows that in the eastern United States of America, in the first half of October, high average temperatures are likely to occur.
Brett Kévanaugh's hearing was attended by more than 20 million people.
More than 20 million people on Thursday were examined by Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court of the six television channels, and she was allegedly subject to confessions against a woman who had committed sexual violence in the 1980s, Mrs. Blasy Ford.
At the same time, there was a political shock in which the broadcaster interrupted the regular broadcasts to reflect the last minute turn of Friday: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake prepared a contract for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Ford told the law committee that it was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had grabbed him with a drunk head and tried to rip off his wife's clothes at the high school graduation party.
In his confession of passion, Kavanaugh said that he was absolutely certain that it did not happen.
According to Nielsen's report, the transfer was likely to be viewed by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company calculated the average audience on TV channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available on other channels showing this appearance, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also normally has problems in calculating the number of people who watch transfers in public authorities.
In comparison, it could be said that this is about the same size as the football final tournament or the distribution of the Oscars.
The opinion leaders of the Fox News Channel, who have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led all networks on average to 5,69 million viewers at a full-day meeting, said Nielsen.
ABC 3,26 million viewers left another place.
CBS had 3,1 million, NBC had 2,94 million, MSNBC had 2,89 million and CNN had 2,52 million viewers, said Nielsen.
The interest remained great after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the official office of the Republican Republican made a statement that he was voting for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras hit a man on Friday morning after he had been subjected to a protestor suffocation, trying to go to a meeting of the Committee on Legal Affairs with the President.
He stood on the ground for several minutes when he was accused and it was transferred directly across the CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?"
He was told: “You have power, while so many women are completely powerless.”
Flake said that his department issued a statement and added before closing the elevator that he had more to say at the Committee on Legal Affairs at its sitting.
The broadcasting and broadcasting networks reflected the broadcast several hours after the Committee of Legal Affairs had to vote to send the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Senate for a vote.
Flace said that he only does this in the understanding that the FBI will be investigating the charges against the candidate next week, which have been demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with friend defate senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision had an impact because it was obvious that the Republicans would not receive Kavanaugh’s votes without the confirmation of the investigation.
The President Trump initiated an investigation into Kavanaugh's case.
British Prime Minister May blames Brexit's critics for the political game.
The Prime Minister questioned those who criticise his plans to leave the European Union, in the "political game" with the future of the UK and in harm to national interests in the interview with the Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Theresa May will arrive at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with the newspaper, which was on the front page of which Theresa May, along with the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson, pressed Johnson for his attack on May, so-called Brexit's cable plan, saying that the proposal that Great Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs is "a total brainwash".

The average of his previous season's games was 5.6 points and 2.6 desks.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the whole team was "strung" and "in shock" due to Wayde's death.
“That’s something you’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Vulcan will burst dust over the city of China.
The ash that bursts from a volcano called Popotepel has reached southern parts of Mexico’s capital city in the south of the city.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano because the crater again started operations that resulted in 183 cases of gas emissions and ashes being recorded within 24 hours.
The centre set a range of amuses and tremors.
The images shared in the social media represented the demonstrations of a car covered with ash in various parts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geologics noticed an increase in the activity of a volcano located 72 km south-east of the capital, after the fall of the 7.1 Magnificent earthquake in September 2017 in the middle of Mexico.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police encounters with Catholic separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after the protestors of independence met with a gang of protestors. Thousands joined the protests of opposition to celebrate the opposing vote on the withdrawal of Catalonia.
A group of disguised separation fighters, held back by the wet police, attacked the last eggs and powdered form, creating thick dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
There was also a problem later when the police had to use witches to control the fights.
Many hours of "No remorse, no forgiveness" were the days when the pro-Self pro-Selfists ran into the country's anti-unity protestors who called "Live Spain!".
According to the local press, the medical aid received a minor injury in 14 protests.
The pings will continue to be up in the area of independence even one year later when Madrid declared the referendum held on 1 October illegal, but which, however, the catalyses in favour of the withdrawal were celebrating.
The voters decided overwhelmingly in favour of independence, although the turnout was low, because those who opposed the exit were largely ignoring the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1000 people were injured last year when the police tried to prevent the vote in front of the polls of the entire region, which resulted in violent clashes.
Those in favour of independence had been at night on Friday night in the polls, in order to avoid protests in support of national police forces.
However, the statements were made, but you had to take the other way.
Narcis Termes, a six-year-old electrician, who participated in a protest against his wife, said he no longer had the hope of seeing Catalogue as independent.
"The last year took place one of the best moments of our lives.
I saw my parents crying for a chance to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite the important, but small, regional elections in December last year, it has been difficult for the Catalan independence-enhancing political parties to maintain the cause this year, since many of the more well-known leaders have either gone to exile or have been detained and are awaiting a trial of their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who is recording a protest with his cell phone to support the police, said that the arguments were aroused by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is getting late,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Juncaras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalans who have been in prison since last year in pre-trial prison, announced that he will be participating in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Creating for elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the protests of the Government of Spain,” he said.
He was arrested as a truck trucking trucking trucking house for a truck: he was arrested for being charged with a trucking truck.
The three men 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the house was scrapped once in Londonder by the car.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 a.m. British time.
Detective Detective Bob Blemmings said that the damage was done to the gates and buildings.
Also, at some point in time, a violin could be shot towards the car.
The Menga hit Livingston with a 1-0 victory in front of the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal in exchange for Livingston was to ensure victory.
Popular Livingston's open Rangers to take Steven Gerrard to second loss in 18 games when a man has been a manager of the Ibrox Club.
The Dolly Menga hit was decisive when Gary Holt raised the level in seconds to Hibernian.
Gerrard will be defeated this season in the first league and will be faced next Sunday with the lead Hearts, who will be on the ground with eight points.
Before this, the Rangers will host Rapid Export to Euroligas on Thursday.
Sometimes Livingston extended his undefeated attack to the end of the day, while the main trainer Holt still felt the loss of his taste since Kenny Miler was replaced last month.
Livingston is losing the opportunity to resist the visitors of the nobility.
The Holt team should have been leading the team long before the goal was hit, inasmuch as their elusive play caused Rangers all kinds of problems.
But his efforts were at the gate where Alan Lithgow made an effort to hit the head of Craig Halkett over the gate.
The waiters calmly let the Rangers look before them, knowing that they could cause problems in certain places for visitors.
And that's also the way they hit the decisive goal.
The Rangers gave away the free blow and Livingston had the opportunity to play the Declan Gallagher, Robinson and Menga scheme, who took the ball and succeeded in doing so from the middle of the penalty zone.
By this time, the Rangers were primarily in possession of the ball, but could not penetrate the defence, which is why the gatekeeper was all perfectly intact on Liam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The same pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced him to defend the gate one time.
The Rangers goalie Allan McGregor disembarked Scott Pittman's blow and Lithgow shined back into Livingston's new team.
The hit reached Livingston on a continuous basis and was hurled away from it in a consistent manner, and two attacks were also directed to go, one from the Falketi Glenn Middleton's attempt to replace Middleton and the other from touching the ball hand.
The perfect achievement from Livingston – an analysis.
BBC Scotland, Alaska, on Lamont Tony Macaron Stadium.
Beautiful performance and result from Livingston.
The player was great, exceeding expectations on the ladder moving upwards completely beyond the ladder.
Their game style and players have barely changed since their return to the top level, but Holt needs to be respected about how he has escaped from the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Häkett was huge, organising an excellent level of protection, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral around the back of the game all the time.
On the Rangers, however, there was little enthusiasm.
Despite being at a good level between them, under Gerrard's leadership, it was not enough to do so in the present sense.
The possession of these last ball proved to be inadequate: reaching home only took place once that could act as an alarm for the Rangers in the centre of the table.
Erdogan's controversial reception in Cologne.
There were both smiles and concerns in Berlin on Saturday (29 September) when the Turkish and German leaders met at breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial German visit to Germany, which aims to improve the relationship between NATO allies.
They are excluded from issues concerning human rights, freedom of the press and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Erdogan Köln then headed for the opening of a new giant machete.
The city has the largest Turkish community outside Turkey.
The police referred to security by prohibiting the assembly of 25 000 members in front of the mosque, but a number of supporters appeared near it in order to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opposed, most of whom are deaf, also made their voice heard, condemning both Erdogan's policy and the Turkish President of the Government's decision to host the President of Turkey in his country.
Fighting protests show that the attitude of the guest has been divided: a Turk living in Germany greets him as a hero, while others despise the man as a self - control.
Traffic accident on Deptford Road: a bicycle was hit by a collision by a car.
In London, a bicycle that hit the car was killed.
The meeting took place on a high-speed road near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street intersection in Deptford, south-east of the city, about 10:15 a.m. British summertime.

The police in London said that the police are concerned with identifying a man and informing his loved ones.
At the site of the event, traffic is closed and buses are rerouted, drivers of motor vehicles are recommended to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six prison officials were injured in restlessness.
The prison department reported that six prison officials were injured by the restlessness in a highly secure men's prison.
The alarms broke out in His Majesty's Long Lartin Prison at Workestershire on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. British summer time and are not over yet.
One wing focused on restlessness involving eight prisoners is involved in dealing with expert wet police officers.
Prisoners were treated for minor facial injury at the time.
The editor of the prison service said: “Educated prison workers have been invited to solve the ongoing case of HMP Long Lartin in prison.
Five of the crew members received medical attention due to injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, the responsible ones will be transferred to the police and their prison sentence may be extended."
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including any of the most dangerous crimes in the country.
In June, it was announced that the warden was taken to hospital after he was attacked by a prisoner.
Last October, however, the Welter Police were invited to prison to silence the serious disturbances in which the prison officers were attacked with a pool bullet.
Orcan Rosa is looking at Lasest and Salt Lake City with headphones (the area may be useful for the hurricane)
The optimal environment does not hit Arizona often, but this is likely to happen at the beginning of next week, when the ravaged hurricane Rosa moves across the desert of the south-west of the United States, leading to the threat of flooding.
On Monday and Tuesday, the public service has already carried out a follow-up mission in the south of Arizona, in the south and south of Nevada, in the south-east of Riga, in the south-east of the north-east of Riga and in the south-east of Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Lasvee and Salt Lake City.
According to a prophecy, Rosa is heading straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the area on Monday with the rainfalls on Monday.
The fact of the national air service is that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have been maintained in the range of 321,86 km in the range of tropical storms or low-restraint levels.
Katrina (19.) was a hurricane which passed 64,37 miles from the border with Arizona."
The most recent models of the national hurricane centre predict a rainfall of between 5,08 and 10,16 cm, which can reach Arizona’s Mogolón Rim in limited areas up to 15,24 cm.
In other desert areas of the South-East of the United States, including the central part of the Rockies and the Great Nebula, the amount of rainfall is likely to be between 2,5 and 5,08 centimetres, extending to 10,16 centimetres in limited areas.
Rosa rainfalls can be a blessing to areas that are affected by sudden floods, as the area is struggling with droughts.
The floods are very alarming, and this kind of rain is likely to be beneficial, as there is a drought in South-East America.
According to the U.S. court monitor, at least 40% of Arizona's extreme, mostly a second-rate drought, was informed by Weather.com.
On the land of Mexico, Rosa Baja is the land of Mexico, where a squirrel crosses Rosa Baja California.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning was still at the level of the hurricane with the largest winds per hour, is now 619,95 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving at a speed of 19,31 km/h north of the hour.
The storm comes into contact with the cool waters of the Pacific Ocean and is therefore a little subdued.
It is expected that Rosa will arrive on land in Mexico with a tropical storm of strength on Monday afternoons or afternoons.
The number of rainfalls in certain regions of Mexico may be high, leading to a significant risk of flooding.
“From Bája to Sonora’s north-west side, rain products with a total volume of 7,62 to 15,24 centimetres can be expected to reach a maximum of 25,4 centimetres,” said Weather.com.
Then Rosa is heading north of the tropical storm in Mexico, reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a tropical lowland area moving across Arizona and arriving in the southern part of Utah on Tuesday’s late evening.
“The threat to Rosa or its consequences is a very strong rainfall in Bajajus, Sonora in the Northwest and the Southwest of the United States,” said the national hurricane centre.
These rainfalls can cause life-threatening floods and flood water in deserts and explosives in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests related to the attempted murder.
Three teenage boys and 20-year-old men were arrested for suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
The victim was taken to a “permanent” hospital.
17-year-old, 18-year-old and 20-year-old men were arrested at night in the Radstock area in Avon and Somerset, said the police.
Officials are asking to contact anyone who may have recorded a case of mobile phone recordings.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered" a democratic party under "insolence and anger".
“Sponsor of Judge Kavanaugh” is the voice of the Democratic Party against an unrequited and unacceptable tactics,” said Trump in his cheering speech in the Argument of West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered" during the process of his appointment, during the democratic party "in the face of cruelty and anger".
Kavanaugh testified against the Congress on Thursday, rejecting fiercely and indiscriminately the accusations of Blasy Ford that he attacked him twenty-six years ago when they were teenagers.
At the same time, Ford gave evidence of his accusations at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “which saw the glory, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day”.
The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is to appoint one of the most valued legal experts of our time, who has an impeccable background in the public service," he said to the people in support of West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to the appointment of Kavanaugh, while at the same time speaking about the importance of the Republic's election in the interim elections.
“For five weeks there has been one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not running, but I'm actually running," he said.
"That's why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates."
The Trum claim that the Democrats are on a mission that aims to “resist and prevent. ”
The first primary vote of proceedings on the Senate floor regarding the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, said the senior leader of the party of the Republican Party to CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has killed thousands, the number of deaths is rising.
At least 384 people were killed and many were proud of the fact that the giant waves hit the beach after the severe earthquake and tsunami hit the island of Sulaee in Indonesia, reporting on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had met on Friday at a beach festival in the city of Paru, when, during the time of their birth, the sea was hit by the waves of two metres, killed a lot of people and destroyed everything that was left on the road.
Tunami followed the Magnificent earthquake of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat occurred yesterday, people were still on the road, not running away immediately, leaving them as victims,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugrho, Press Representative of the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency at a press conference held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on behalf of the press conference in Sutopo Purwo Nugrho Jakarta.
“It didn’t come alone, but took cars, beams and houses with it, wiping everything off the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km per hour on the high seas before reaching the shore.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16 700 people were evacuated to the 24 centers of Paru.
Air photos published by the Disaster Agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and stores, broken and collapsed bridges and water-baked mosques.
The trails in the coastal city continued on Saturday as well.
In an area with a population of 2.4 million people, there was a feeling of the wave of earthquakes.
In his statement, the Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that on Friday, the energy released after a major earthquake was nearly 200 times higher than the nuclear bomb dropped in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical area of a city on the long and narrow edge could have increased the strength of the tsunami, said BPPT.
Nugroho described the damage as “common” and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, supermarkets and hotels have collapsed.
He said that the bodies of some victims were found under the cracks of broken buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of deaths and damage could be larger in a coastal area 300 km north of Palus called Donggala, which was closer to the middle of the earthquake.
Notifications from Donggala “are completely incomplete and contain no information,” Nugroho said.
“There are more than 300 000 people in the region, ” said the Red Cross in his statement, adding that its team and volunteers are heading for places to suffer.
“This is already a tragedy that could get worse,” he said.
The job was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing the tsunami in the city of Palu, although he said that the waves reached the beach while the warning was being issued.
In social media amateurs, you can see a man on the top floor of a building, who will panic to warn against a tsunami approaching people moving in the street below.
Minutes later, the water wall reaches the beach, carrying houses and cars along with them.
The Reuter did not immediately manage to confirm the truth of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that hindered communication in the Palu area and made it difficult for the authorities to carry out rescue work.
The army has started sending transport aircraft to assist Jakarta and other cities, said the authorities, but the rangers still need food and other basics.
The city-based airport was reopened for rescue work, remaining closed until October at other times.
President Joo Widodo plans to visit the emergency centres on Sunday.
The number of deaths due to the Indonesian tsunami increased by more than 800.
It's really bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongga arrived safely in the city of Pau, which is hidden in the tents set up in their front yard, they saw the sightings on their way, Mr Doseba said.
“They said they saw a lot of lost houses,” he said.
It's really bad.
While the support forces have been heavily engaged in disaster mitigation operations, some of the members of the staff of the foreign aid organisations with high experience were prevented from travelling to Palus.
According to the Indonesian rules, foreign funding, supplies and backups can only be deployed if an accident is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“This continues to be a regional disaster,” said Aulia Arrin, press representative of the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster," we can start to accept international aid, but this state has not yet been announced."
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the lives of the people were lost, and the families were still full of hope that their loved ones would be these wonderful events that would ease the occurrence of natural disasters.
A young boy was raised from the toilet appeal on Saturday.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped outside her mother's body for two days under the brigs of her mother's body.
In Indonesia, national parachutists team coach Gendon Subandono trained two lost parachutists for Asian songs that took place in Indonesia at the beginning of this month.
The rest of those trapped in Roa Roa Hotel are her students, added Mr Mandagi.
“As a senior parachutist, I have a personal burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon talked about how, after the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel, he was desperate for WhatsApp's messages to the competitors who were at the party.
However, his messages were marked with only one gray bird instead of two blue birds.
“I think that means that the messages didn’t get there,” he said.

Kanye West: A rapper takes his new name Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
On Saturday Twitter, the man announced the change by saying, "Previous Kanye West."
From the age of 41 West has been called Ye for some time, and the man also used the name as the title of his eighth album published in June.
The change will take place before his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where a man is expected to publish his new album in Yandhi.
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled his concert "apocalypse of feelings" by sending a singer to Ariana Grande, said you will be the author.
In addition to being a short name for the man, West has previously said that it is a religious word for him.
"I think "yes" is one of the most widely used words in the Bible, which means "you"," said the West earlier, discussing with Radio Messenger Big Boy the name of his album.
“That’s me, that’s us, that’s us.
I changed my name from Kany, which means "this one," the name Ye, which is just a reflection of our good and bad, our confusion and everything else.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
Kanye West is not the only rapist to play his name.
Sean Combs is mainly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year the guru stated that he prefers his names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who worked with West before, has also used his name with and without thought, with or without capitals and capitals.
Mexican politician AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians.
At a time when the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of the bloody attacks against students, the Mexican presidential candidate Andresē Lopez Obrador has promised never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelco Vars on Sunday that “he will never use an army to control the Mexicans. ”
The army attacked a peaceful protest in the field on 2 October 1968, killing 300 people at a time when the entire Latin America was carrying left-wing student movements.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by paying students monthly allowances and opening more free national universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational potential will attract young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should organise the financing of the artificial intelligence agent.
“Since China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount allocated to research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee, a financier and an engineer for artificial intelligence, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments were published after the various parts of the US Government made declarations on artificial intelligence, although the United States does not have an overall official strategy for artificial intelligence.
At the same time, last year, the United States presented its plan to be the author of the renewal of the artificial intelligence by 2030.
“Registration of the research budget for the intelligence intelligence research would be a good start given that the other countries are so far behind the US and we are acting on behalf of the next investigation of the artificial intelligence intelligence,” said Lee.
The second funding would rebalance the likelihood that the next major artificial intelligence achievement will be carried out in the United States, said to Lee CNBC in this interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Super Powers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of the Sinnovation Ventures, which funded one of the most outstanding artificial intelligence companies in China Face++.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that won America's best Othello player. Later, he was on the board of Microsoft Research and President of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the previous US Government’s technological competition, such as the US Defence Department’s Research Centre’s Robotics Competition (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Monotics Challenge) and asked when the next competition would take place to help identify the following dreamers.
“US scientists must work hard to get funding from the government,” said Lee.
“China is not the one to take over the intellectuals; these are the new business,” said Lee.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired brilliant scientists from universities in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
He said that changes in immigration policy could help the US to support artificial intelligence efforts.
“The idea that persons who have received a doctorate in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered a green card,” said the man.
In July 2017, the Council of the States of the PRC published its next new artificial intelligence development plan.
“The Chinese National Science Foundation distributes funding to people working in academic institutions in a similar way to how the National Science Foundation and other government institutions allocate money to US scientists, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” said Lee.
At the beginning of this year the U.S. Defence Department set up a joint artificial intelligence centre to involve partners from both industry and educational institutions. However, the White House announced that a committee was set up by an artificial intelligence officer.
This month, DARPA announced that he was starting to finance a $2 million initiative under AI.
The public research fund currently finances more than 100 million million dollars per year for research into artificial intelligence.
At the same time, the US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not been modified.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country.
In the Sunday referendum, the Macedonians voted on whether to change the name of the country to the Republic of Northern Macedonia, a step that would also resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has prevented the approval of statements of accession to the EU and NATO.
Greece, which is a country with its name in Moscow, claims that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a requirement for that territory and that it has prohibited its accession to NATO and to the EU.
The governments of the two countries agreed in June on a new name, but national opponents argue that the name would harm the national personality of the Russian Slavic people.
President Gjoge Ivanov said that he would not participate in the referendum and that the campaign of rejection had raised doubts as to whether the election would reach the 50% share required to hold the referendum.
The referendum asks: "Do you support the accession of the Russian Federation to NATO and the EU, in agreement with Greece?"
The supporters of the amendment, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that this is the price to be paid for the purposes of ensuring the accession of organisations such as the EU and NATO, which are one of the countries created after the collapse of the Union.
“I came here today to vote for the future of our country and for the future of our young people, so that they can live freely under the protective hand of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” said the 79-year-old Øa Georgijevska, who voted in Skopjes, who was 79 years old.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said that they will follow the outcome of the vote in order to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority vote in Parliament is necessary to change the name.
The National Electoral Commission said that there are no reports of irregularness at 8:00 a.m.
However, the turnout rate was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent of last year's parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of the voters were registered.
“I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, who voted in Skopje, the capital of the city of Tallinn.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, gave his vote in the referendum on 30 September 2018 on the change of the name of the country, which would give them the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage in front of the Parliament building in Sköje, setting up tents for those who ignore the referendum.
“We want to belong to NATO and the EU, but we want to join the head up, not through the door of the servants,” said Kädarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and gain European-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments in Macedonia with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will support the change of name because more than 80 percent of citizens are in favour of EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after giving his vote.
He said that "yes-word" would be "confirmation of our future."
The results of the survey published by the Institute for Political Studies on Monday revealed that 30-43 per cent of voters who are below the necessary turnouts are planning to take part in the referendum.
A survey conducted by Telma revealed that 57% of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said that you would say yes.
The success of the referendum shall be 50 percent plus one vote.
Failure to vote would constitute the first serious blow to the Western government's policy after the government took over last May.
Look at: The City Player Sergio Aguero is going through the Brighton protection for the goal throughout the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defense, guaranteeing City 2-0 victory on Saturday's Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero looked as if his goal, which was hit by his 65th designer, was ridiculously easy to see.
The Argentinian attacker passed the middle course at the beginning of the sequence.
He broke through three Brighton protectors before he got to the open field.
Aguero was then wrapped with four green shirts.
He broke through another protector before running past several players at the border of the Brighton Penalty.
Then he hit the ball to the left of himself, where Sterling was.
The English attacker used the first blow to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit the Brighton gatekeeper Mathew Ryan on the right side of the network by hitting Mathew Ryan on the right side of the network.
“Aguero has trouble with his feet,” said City manager Pep Guardiola to reporters.
“We told him he was playing 55 or 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We're lucky he hit a goal at the moment."
But Sterling was the one who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the fight against Premier League.
The gate was shot at the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball in this game clearly in Brighton territory.
He sent the ball gently to Leroy Sane, on the left side of the air, on the left side of the air.
Sane was able to hit the ball some time before he led Sterling beyond.
Skys hit the ball on the net just before it slipped out of the border.
Manchester will play at 12:55 Rhein–Neckar Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany, on Tuesday with Hoffenheim in the League of the Champions’ League.
Mr. Scherzer wants to play the joymaker against the Rockise.
If the Nationals missed the final tournament, there was no great reason for the new beginning.
But the contestant Scherzer hopes to make the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, who runs the West with one Los Angeles Dodger, still have the hope of getting to the finals.
Rockies guaranteed at least a jogging spot with the 5th win over the State on Friday night at least, but the team still wants to secure the status of its first division.
“Although we do not play for anything, at least we can try, knowing that playing in Denver in this audience and in the second team environment is probably at a higher level than any other game that I might be facing this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete here?"
The nations have not yet appointed a Sunday premiere, but they claim to be in a situation like this in which the Scherzey Pass is based.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th feeding, made a Wednesday warm-up session and fed on Sundays as usual.
This Washington right-handed player leads 18-7, his ERA is 2.53, the number of kicks 300 and the opportunity of its 220 2/3 this season.
The Trump will have a lively conversation in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the situation surrounding the election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while at the same time speaking about the importance of the Republic's election activity in the interim elections.
“All we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before our lives, one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is a big event I'm not running for, but I'm actually running for, which is why I'm everywhere to fight for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You will see this terrible, extremely extreme group of democrats, and you will see this happening in front of your own eyes.
And they have decided to take back the power by any means necessary, and you will see their wickedness and dirty game.
I don't care who they hurt, who they need to run over for power and control, what they want is power and control over everything, and we don't give it to them."
The headings are, according to him, on a mission to “resist and prevent”.
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "the hate, the evil, the naked and the lying."
He referred, by name, to the Democratic Member of the Senate Committee of the Law of the Senate, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who shouted out loudly among the audience.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak this document?
E, ah, what?
No, no, wait – that was one of the worst body language examples, indeed the worst body language I've ever seen."
The lesbian party is no longer a big community.
This is unacceptable to those who express their opinion.
When my local party's Momentum activists voted to condemn me, it was not surprising.
After all, I'm the last one on the list of leborist Members who says you're not welcome, and all this for expressing my opinion.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, from Parliament, became a party to the same concern because he stood up for the renegade.
In my case, the judges judged me to be inappropriate with Corbyn.
Responsible economic policies, national security and European issues, which are strangely similar to issues on which there was a disagreement with previous cases.
In the Communication from Nottingham East Campers' Party, we read that "we would like meetings to be inclusive and creative."
For the most part, my experience with the meetings of the General Assembly of Friday evenings is exactly the same as that of my eight-year local leborist Member.
Unfortunately, as of today, this will no longer apply to most meetings, and the promise to be more generous and generous in politics has long been forgotten, if ever remembered.
It is becoming increasingly evident that different perspectives are not acceptable in the Leiborist Party and, for each opinion, assesses who is acceptable to the Party Bureau.
This started just after Jeremy became the leader. A co-worker with whom I thought I would share similar views in the past was now waiting for me to change my mind and adopt positions that I would never have accepted, regardless of whether this is a matter of national security or an EU single market.
Every time I stand up publicly, regardless of what I'm really saying, this sentencing sentence in social media, calling for my return, ignoring party politics, and saying that I should not be a part of the Italian party.
It's not just my personal experience.
Indeed, I know I've been more fortunate than any of my co-workers because the comments I'm looking for are mostly political.
I admire the competence and decision-making of those co-workers who face sexual or racial abuse every day, but who never swear.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this policy is how the levels of abuse have become commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Leiborist Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The fact is, however, that we are no longer such a big community and by changing any initiative or election rules, the party will become more narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years to keep my head down, to speak less, and "that would be fine."
That's not what I had to do with politics.
Since I joined the Leiborist Party as a student 32 years ago, motivated by the care of the Government of Watcher, which had left my big school classroom literally at the end of the collapse, I have been trying to talk about better public services for those who need it most, acting as a member of the local council and as a minister of the government.
I have never kept my policy hidden, including in the last elections.
There is no way that someone in Nottingham East got confused with my political views or areas of non-consultation with the local management.
To all those who promoted the movement on Friday, I would like to say that if the state is moving towards Brett, which is damaging to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy, being loyal to the leader of the Lionist Party.
But it is not really the only thing I have, intended for the Nottingham Moment, but for my advocates, whether they belong to the Leiborist Party or not: I am proud that I serve you, and I promise you that not one threat of retaliation or a political point will stop me from acting for what I believe to be in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr moves to the top.
Two recent events may have somewhat tilted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayy deserves to win this wonderfully fun Tennti first too much.
They are now the only unbeatable team in the front of the 10th table.
After all, it was a high level of protection for the team and a better risk taking, which is the way the home team won and coach Peter Murchiel is perfectly right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested all the time during the games and we’re still undefeated, so of course I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “The story of Ayris was that they used their options better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute test, taken over by Frazier Climo, gave Ayri a head start, but to the Scottish captain, Rory Hughes, who was given up by the Soldiers, this yellow card gave Melris the opportunity to perform a failed attempt.
Climo increased Ayri's premise with a penalty immediately before the end of the half-life, reaching a position of 17 in favour of Ayri by the end of the half-life with a private order.
But Melrose successfully started the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, which was taken over by Baggot, reduced the difference by five points.
Then a long delay occurred due to serious injury to Ruardh Knott, after which the man was taken away on the frame. As the game continued, Ayr further increased its lead thanks to Stafford McDowall's test, which was transmitted by Climo.
The captain, Captain Macpherson, was then yellow card, but once again, the player at Melrose paid Bruce Colvine's attempt to fail to send him away after strong pressure.
However, the team playing on the field again took strength and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to prevent Climo from being punished on the line without a ball, MacPherson put the ball behind the Aries going down.
Climo passed on the ball as he did almost after the game was started when Kyle Rowe tried the David Armstrong box box and sent a side shield to Gregor Henry on the fifth test of the team playing on the field.
Still Game star intends to start a new career in the restaurant industry.
Still Game's star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to act in the field of catering, after being discovered that the man was appointed Director of the recognised restaurant.
A 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in a well-known BBC TV series he writes and plays along with a long-term comedy partner Greg Hemphilli.
A couple have announced that this nine season will be the last of the series, and it seems that Kiern will be making new plans for life after Niernan's new plans.
According to official records, he is the Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, but Scottish Suni's source suggested that Kiernan would like to enter the Glasgow "flowering restaurant".
"The sea is ours": without sea bounded Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen their path to the Pacific Ocean.
Sailors patrol the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
The flags of the oceanic flags flying above the premises of the Agency.
To the Marine Bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon, the phrase: “The sea is our right is ours.
Restoring it is our responsibility."
There is a memory of a coastal line lost to Chile in its bloody Christian conflict in the 19th century, still alive. It is the same living wish to sail again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in recent decades, since Bolivia is awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of negotiations.
“There is a passion, a spirit of unity and peace, and the country is naturally waiting for a positive result,” said the Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
A large number of Bolists across the globe are looking at the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Hague Court will be in favour of Bolivia, after which Chile will be obliged to negotiate with Bolivia after decades of incoherent discussions in order to give the latter an independent path to the sea.
The proud charismatic native president, Evo Morales, who is awaiting a conflict of opposition in the election next year, is at a great deal of stake in the decision of Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he swore at the end of August.
Some of the analyses, however, consider that the court is unlikely to vote in favour of Bolivia, or, if so, that would change very little.
The United Nations authorities in the country have no power to grant out of Chile's territory and it has provided that the outcome of any negotiations is not to be determined.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is made only six months after hearing the final statements indicates that it was not a ‘serious case’, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law in Chile.
And beyond the additional reasons of Bolivia, the last four years may have changed the situation.
“The problem of access to the sea has been taken away by the current Ukrainian authorities,” said Zárate.
Morales' military eloquent talk has lost all the rest of Chile's goodwill, he remarked.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after all, the debate will be extremely difficult.
Two countries have not changed their ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, a representative of the Republic of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the argument that the decision of the Court was not necessary in time for a decision to be taken.
Monday will give Bolivia a "an extra opportunity to start a new era in the country's relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end the conflict with mutual benefit that lasted for 139 years," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most well-known Presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue to express political hatred.
“Bolivia will never give up her right to access the Pacific Ocean,” she added.
"There is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea said that the release of nuclear weapons will not take place until the country can trust the United States of America.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that his people will never give up nuclear weapons first if you cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Meeting.
He called on the United States to review the promises made by the country leaders of competitors during the Singapore Summit.
He will comment on this when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo almost seems to be resumption of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Uni.
According to Rári, this is about airlocks, that the United States' continued restrictions and refusal to terminate the war with Korea would lead to the abandonment of North Korea.
Washington will carefully consider such a statement if Pyongyang does not take the first important steps towards the opposition.
Kim and US President Donald Trump will hold a second summit.
But scepticism, according to which Pyongyang is willing to give up the evidence that the state is likely to see as an opportunity to ensure its own safety, is widespread.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to agree on another Kim/Tõmp Summit.
The Paris Mosõõu will bring a series of massive head covers to the viewer, which will bring them to the buyers on the streets of their neighborhood.
If you want to increase your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun, you will no longer have to look for it.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of very strange head covers to the stage during their summer season of 2019, which blinded the Paris fashionable.
High and impractical hats have been fashionable this summer, and these designers have sent their kick-ass creative works to the top.
The top piece of Valentino’s top piece was an over-selled beige hat covering the heads of the models, which was decorated with a wonderfully broad edge.
Other excessive clothing included jeweled watermelons, Várriküpa and even ananass, but their purpose is not to ice them.
Thom Brown also showed a strange selection of masks, doing so just in time for Halloween.
Most of the coloured masks were crammed mouths, so they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than they did in a great way.
One part of the creation was reminded of a diving suit with airpipes and glasses, while the other resembled a melted ice cream tube.
And if you continue with the huge mooring, you'll be lucky.
The moors predict that oversized headgear can also reach your nearby shopping streets.
The oversized hats immediately follow La Bomba, which is a six-inch-foot-length shoulder hat, seen in the head of all the celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cultural trade mark that created a highly impractical hat in the social media sent to the openings another big piece — a lined beach bag that is almost as big as the bikini model it wears.
The dark-orangian raffic bag, which is a raffian-smuggling and white leather bag, was the top piece of the summer collection of Jacquemus La Riviera 2019 in Paris's fashion week.
The stylistic Luke of the celebrities, Armate said to the FEMAIL: “I look forward to seeing big hats and bag bags on the shopping street next summer. Since the designer has had such an effect, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for excessive clothing.”
John Edward: Language education is important for the citizens of the world.
Scottish private schools have remained at the forefront of the academic excellence table and have continued in 2018 with the following outstanding exam results, reinforced by personal and shared success in sport, art, music and other community ventures.
Schools with a total of over 30 000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS) are seeking to provide their students and their parents with the best service.
The aim of private schools is to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and place as world citizens.
As a public sector capable of shaping and implementing a tailor-made curriculum, we can see that modern languages remain known and desired in schools.
Dylan Mandela said: “If you speak to a person in a language that understands him, it will come to his head.
When you speak to him in his native language, it reaches his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to create a relationship and trust in people from other countries.
This year's latest exam results show that the languages at the top of the tables are the languages where the level of exams is highest among private schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received a high score A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 per cent of students in Mandarin became A grade, the same grade became 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of Spanish students and 63 per cent of Spanish students.
This shows that Scottish private schools support foreign language as a vital job in life, which children and young people will undoubtedly need in future.
The languages that are now among the choices of the subjects are in the curriculum of private schools and other schools as well as the STEM students (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
A study conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 revealed that, among the reasons why it is difficult for employers to find job vacancies, 17% of respondents had a lack of skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly compulsory to prepare young people for their future work.
As much as more promising job offers require language skills, such skills in a globalised world are becoming essential.
Despite career choices made, the acquisition of a second language gives a real benefit to a person in the future, because language skills are lifelong.
The warmness of communication with foreign citizens directly gives a multilingual person a competitive edge right away.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov of over 4000 adults in 2013, 75 percent of respondents do not speak any foreign language well enough to talk about it. The only language with a two-digit percentage was French 15 percent.
That is why financing language learning today is important for children today.
Knowledge of the language, especially the languages of the emerging economies, provides a better opportunity for children to find a good job.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in each school.
The bulk of the school focuses on classical modern languages, while other schools teach languages that are considered to be the most important in the United Kingdom for the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Despite the child’s best interests, private schools always have the opportunity to choose between a variety of languages taught by experts in their field.
Scottish private schools have devoted themselves to providing a learning environment that prepares children and provides them with the skills necessary to achieve success regardless of what the future will bring them.
It can no longer be denied that, in a global industrial environment, languages are essential for the future of the country and must therefore also be reflected in education.
Just modern languages should really be considered "International Communication Skills".
Private schools continue to offer young Scottishs choice, diversity and insight.
You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

LeBron makes his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
No longer have to wait for the infamous breeders to see LeBron James doing his debut at the Lake of Los Angeles.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James would play at the Sunday-on-season pre-seasonal opening game in Denver Nuggets against the San Diego team.
The number of his subjects still needs to be determined.
“It is more than one and less than 48,” said Walton Lakers’ official website.
Laker reporter Mike Truell told me that James is likely to play the number of minutes he has read.
Last week's training was asked about James' plans for the six-monthly period of Lakers. James was asked about his plans.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to warm myself up,” he said.
End of West Virginia election event, YouTube channel, YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump will begin his election campaign series this evening in the Argument of West Virginia.
This is the Trump of five campaign events scheduled for the first week of the following week, including stopping in friendly places such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote on the vote will stand as long as Trump elects whom he will appoint as the free seat of the Supreme Court, he will try to increase the support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republic will threaten the abolition of control in Congress after the vote in November.
What time will Trump’s tonight’s campaign event take place in West Virginia and how to watch it on the Internet?
A more ambitious campaign event will take place in the Finland of West Virginia this Saturday evening on 29 September 2018 at 19:00 on the time of the East Coast.
The best Western Virginia campaign event can be watched on the Internet through YouTube flow.
It is likely that Mr Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, will talk about this week's meetings that became tense in connection with charges of sexual abuse, while the Senate vote has been suspended for the week until the D.A. is investigating the matter.
However, the main aim of the series of campaign events is to help build new momentum for the Republicans who will face difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign manager said that the aim of these five events next week is "to encourage volunteers and supporters if the Republicans are trying to protect and extend to them a majority of the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters said.
“The control of the Congress is so important for the president’s agenda that Trump is driving to as many states as possible in the fast season of electoral campaigns,” said the Press Representative to Reuters, who did not want to mention his name.
Tonight’s campaign event, planned at the Wesbanco Stadium in the Guild, can be presented by supporters from “Ohios and Pennsylvania, and will also receive coverage in the Pittsburgh media,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
This is the second time that Trump is visiting West Virginia in the last month. It is a state in which he received more than 40 per cent of the voters' votes in 2016.
The Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is on the basis of an interview to guide the results of the interview.
“For Murriesey, it is not a good sign that the President has come to support his results,” said politician Simon Hader of the University of West Virginia, reported Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team is pissed off, keeping their hopes high before Sunday parties.
After the three unilateral sessions, the games that took place this Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what Ryder Cup needed.
The fluctuating turning point pen is a completely fictional concept in sport, but players really believe it, especially in competitions like this one.
So, what do they think would be going to change right now?
“They led by six points, which have now become four, so I think I can consider it a small point of reference,” said Jordan Pieth at the end of the day.
Europe has an advantage, it is clear that four points are led and 12 points are still in play.
According to Spieth, Americans feel that they don't have enough wind in the wind, but they have a lot of encouragement, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Toe, who played together all day and each received three points out of four.
Spieth has been admirable both in the case of twins and twins and an example.
These bouts of butter in the throats became more and more loud in every circle, masking the determining putt, which would have led to the scar of the second match after he and Thomas were down with the two of them.
He's the one who won the fight on 15th. He sent a call like a call that shows a man's belief that the Americans are not yet out of the race.
“You just have to play harder and worry about your fight,” said Spieth.
It's the only thing a player can do.
18 holes, not to leave a mark.
The only players with more points after the last two last two days than Spieth and Thomasel who have more points after the last two days than Spieth and Thomas are Ryder Cup's undisputed letters Francesco Molinar Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup's undisputed letters Francesco Molinar and Tommy Fleetwood.
Europe's strange but loved pair is four out of four and nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the Bogey this afternoon, avoiding the Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back on Friday morning.
This game and the way in which their energy flows to and from both a loud crowd and from there reinforces the opinion that the players with whom they compete on Sunday, and that when the sun comes over Le Golf National, there is no chance of Europe being a more famous player than Fleetwood or Molinar to support victory.
Above all, they both go to different holes at the same time.
However, stories of European glory are presumptuous.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked with Sergio Garcia, four-ball heroes this morning, a busy job when the man was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and twice on the first nine, digging into a hole so deep that they could not dig themselves out of it.
On Saturday, however, there is no one to figure you out.
Four balls and a pair of games are extremely attractive to look closely at just the interaction between the twos, advice for each other, advice for the lack of advice and advice on how to change the way in which you can momentarily change.
Europe has played better as a team to this day and has started to lead a strong lead for the last day, but this fourth session shows that the U.S. team is struggling with a fight that some, especially Americans, have doubted.
Europe is located in Ryder Cup on the first 10 days of the first 10 six leaders.
Europe will get a good lead on the first day of Ryder Cup, starting with a 10 month lead in front of the United States of America after the summer’s four-balls and pair games.
The duo-fleetwood and Francesco Molinar led two victorys against the troubled Tiger Woods in order to raise their current score to 4 points in Leigrad.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, who contributed two years ago to the maintenance of the lost cup in Hazeltine, was, after the fall, in the Americas' half of the morning at four-ball in the morning, winning the 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the match, or two games, but they could not be compensated for the gap.
The Furyki side needs eight points to celebrate a cup of 12 singles on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row, along with Molinar, who, after this lovely weekend, is called Molliwood, is the second pair who has won four points in the history of Ryder Cup.
After destroying the Four-ball Woods and the Patrick Reed, they continued in the same spirit, defeating Woods and America's original Bryson Dechamb, for certain: 5-4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturdays, showed a random shine, but by now lost his 29 four-balls and two-games 19 in a row of seven losses.
Justin Rose, who had gone out by four balls this morning, returning with his partner Henrik Stenson, winning a 2-1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who is ranked first and third in the world order.
Europe did not succeed, although the competition was held south of Paris with a pleasant and windy weather.
The third great winner of the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a two-point benchmark for the Americans on Saturdays.
In four-balls, they won a certain victory over Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in 2-1 Spain, coming back later and winning the Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3, having lost a two-legged two-legged Poulter and Rory McIlroyd 4-3.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup has the team returned from a four-point deficit, going to singles, although as owner, only a pin is needed to support the Furyki side of the cup.
Having two days in second place, after Sunday's counterattack, it seems that they will not succeed.
North Korea says that "not in any case" will not make them disprove because of the lack of confidence on the one hand.
On Saturday, the North Korea Foreign Minister told the UN that their confidence in the United States was exacerbated by the ongoing restrictions and that the country is not planning to abandon its nuclear weapons in such circumstances on the one hand.
At the annual meeting of the World Organisation, Yong Ho said that North Korea has over the past year taken "a significant measure of good faith", such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning the nuclear site and promising not to release nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“But we do not see that the United States has responded,” he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, our country has no security security, and under these circumstances we will in no way agree to make ourselves the first to be armed unilaterally."
While repeating the complaints made by North Korea regarding the Washington resistance to the "intensive" approach to denuclearisation by which North Korea is rewarded when it takes gradual steps, it seemed important in his statement that it did not reject one-sided non-proliferation, as Pjongyang has done in the past.
Mr Ri referred to the joint statement by Kim Jong Uni and Donald Tõmp for the first time on 12 June between the President of the United States and the North Korea leader at the Summit in Singapore, when Kim promised to move towards "the abandonment of nuclear weapons in the peninsula" and Trump promised security for North Korea.
North Korea has requested the official end of the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
It has also been against the calls to relax the strict international restrictions on North Korea.
“The U.S. calls for “first abandonment of nuclear weapons” and increases the pressure of restrictions to achieve their goal of forcefully, even resisting the declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“I understand that restrictions push us to our knees is a dream for a person who does not know us at all.
However, the problem is that the continuing restrictions will deepen our confidence."
Ri did not mention Kim and Trump's plans for the second summit, which the US leader emphasised earlier this year in the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister highlighted the meeting between three Kimi and South Korea's leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If one of the parties to the issue of nuclear weapons was South Korea, not the US, the issue of nuclear weapons in the South would not have reached such a state."
However, Ri's speech was suddenly different from last year's when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to address the continent of the United States of America with North Korea's missiles after Mr. Baha President Trump called Kim's suicide mission "the rocketman".
Last year, North Korea was forced to completely destroy the Trump in the United Nations to Kim's sky for her courage to take steps towards defamation, but added that there is still a great deal to be done and that the restrictions must remain in force until North Korea ceases to nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time to do this, saying, "Is this going to take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward the measures taken by Pjongjang.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The enforcement of the Security Council's sanctions must continue forcefully and without fail until we are fully and permanently able to confirm the abandonment of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased the restrictions applicable to North Korea by endeavouring to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Riga next to the UN General Assembly and later said that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompoo has visited North Korea three times this year, although the last trip did not go very well.
After a meeting with the Jewish Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, after which he understood North Korea within just a few hours of “gang-like demands”.
This month in the meeting with Moon, North Korea allowed missiles and nuclear complexes to be demolished if the United States were to "take appropriate measures".
He told him that Kim had told him that under "compatible measures" he meant security safeguards allowed in Wormp Singapore and progress towards normalisation of the relationship with Washington.
Harvard students learn how to get a good rest.
This year, the University of Harvard offers a new course where students need to sleep more often to combat an increasing aggressive culture, which learns through night-long study marathons at caffeine levels.
Students who love the university at the best of the world's universities are often helpless when it comes to taking care of themselves.
Professor Charles Czeisler, who is the designer of this course, a sleep doctor at Harvard Medical School and a professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, believes that this is the first of its kind in the United States of America.
He was inspired to create a course after he spoke about how sleep disorders affect learning.
"At the end, a girl came to me and asked, "Why is this for me now, my last year is being spoken?"
He said that no one ever told him the significance of a dream - it made me sick," he explained to Telegraph.
The course that first came to the curriculum this year will explain to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporty results and help to improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at a Harvard Medical School and health director at the University, said that the university decided to take a course on a curriculum after finding that students were in serious sleep poverty at work during the week.
The full-time course covers a number of interaction tasks.
One section presents a picture of the joint collection. There are students who can visit coffee bags, curtains, sports shoes and books and explain the effects of caffeine and light on how sleeplessness affects sports results and the importance of the habit of sleeping.
The second part explains how long-term sleeplessness can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, combined with interactive symbols, encourages participants to think about their daily custom.
“We know that this does not change students’ behaviour immediately.
But we believe that they are right to know - just as you are right to know about the health effects of smoking cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
He said that there is still pride in night-time study marathons, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that sleeplessness is, however, an increasing problem.
"Providing a high-quality sleep time should be the "sil weapon" of the student, which combats stress, fatigue and anxiety," he added. "It even helps to increase weight, as the lack of sleep makes the brain earthly, making man hungry forever."
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler to establish a course, having attended one of his grades in the previous year, his first Harvard year.
Raymond said that the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to contribute to the creation of a university course.
Next step, he wants all graduate students to complete a similar course of study before joining a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm clock for both bedtime and sleep, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of electronic screens and LED light caused by "blue light", as this may damage their daily rhythm and cause trouble with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal was defeated by Gerrard men.
The Rangers suffered another poor visit when the Dolly Menga hit by Steven Gerrard brought a 1-0 victory to Livingston.
The Ibrox side was hoping to have its first guest victory since the four-to-one St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as a leader, leaving eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's guide from Hearts.
Menga created its gate seven minutes before the half-time and the Rangers' poor willingness could never recover from it .
The Rangers will therefore fall to the sixth position, Livingston will rise to the third position, remaining below Hibernian with only one gate.
It may not be a problem for the Rangers to be over because their attacker, Calum Spence, needed a head wound treatment after he was shot with an apparently discarded object.
Gerrad made eight changes to the side that led to the Arys and Betfred Cup semifinals.
At the same time, Holt went on with Livi 11, who took a point from Hearts last week and would have been satisfied with how his well-trained boys smothered their opponents at every step of the way.
The Rangers may have been more powerful, but Livingston did much more with his ball.
They should have hit the gate on the second half of the second half, when Menga first shifted Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's gate, but the half-guard didn't take his chance.
The deep-bodied Keaghan Jacobs occult was then found by Captain Craig Halketti, but its defence partner Alan Lithgow was only able to make a broad arc of the blow in the back of the post.
The rangers did get control, but they seemed to have more hope than faith in the last third of their game.
Alfredo Morelos felt confident that he should have been punished when he ran into Steven Lawless at the 15th hour of the game, while Steven Thomson did not approve of the Columbia Player’s complaint.
The Rangers managed to target only two hits in the first half, but the former Ibrox gatekeeper Liam Š did not have any concerns about Lasaa Coulibaly's head shot or Ovie Ejaria's event.
Although the 34th-minute arrow of Livi may have ruined the game, no one can deny that they deserved it entirely for their performances.
Once again, the Rangers couldn't stop Jacobs's severe performance.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot Scott Robinson, who maintained peace and chose Menga, who just finished the plan.
Gerrard was acting on a break, exchanging Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and this exchange paid off when the persevering player beat up Morelos, but the impressive one was trying to stop him from being in his position.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors to play the exact type of game that fits them where Lithgow and Halkett picked up long balls.
On the other side, it could have been the end of the picture of its leadership, but McGregor stood firm to prevent Jacobs from hitting Lithgow with a big curve.
The Ranger's replacement player Glenn Middleton again asked for a hit when he drowned with Jacobs, which Thomson again refused to accept.
Almanah: Geiger counter inventor
And now read about our Sunday Anniversary Almah: 30th of September 1882, today 136 years ago and the day of the future physique Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
From the beginning of this science, Geiger's counter also became a populace beginning, as in 1950's "Coronado Watches", where, in the main, they were apparently unlikely by cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
"What is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the pod of atoms that have disappeared from the radioactivity of minerals."
Evans: “Don’t tell me, it’s just going to go shopping!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention he calls lives on.
A new cancer cancer can be used to teach the system’s immune system to “see” fraud cells.
The cancer cancer cancer cancer can teach the immune system to "see" fraud cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the system’s system of detection of fraud cells as part of the treatment process.
The method involves the production of an immune cell from a patient and the modification of their cells in the laboratory.
They can turn these "see" for many cancers into a common protein and they are injected back.
The study vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that taught to teach the detection of ART to the immune system lost her ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the removal of the immune cells from the patient. These cells are modified in the laboratory to obtain a "see" protein that has spread to various HER2 cancers and then re-inject these cells.
Professor Jay Benzoffsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Bethesdas Marylands explained: “Our results show that we have a very promising package.”
HER2 “leads to the growth of many cancers” including breast, ovary, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzoffsky explained.
A similar approach between patients taking immune cells and teaching them to target cancer cells has been used to treat certain types of leukaemia.
Kanye West began with the Trump support tribe, carrying the Maga hat to SNL's broadcast.
It didn't go very well.
You will be sent to the Saturday Night Live Studio to respond to a bad attitude towards Kanye West, following his mixed speech by President Donald Trump of the United States of America and announced his nomination for the same post in 2020.
After that night his third song, which was named Ghost Town and where he wore a hat with a letter from Make America Great, started to play against the gypsy democrats and repeated his support to Trump.
“I have spoken so much to white people who ask me: ‘How can you like Trump, he is a race?’
“If I were so concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, ” he said.
SNL started setting up with Matt Damon, where Hollywood's fame was making fun of Brett Kavanaghi's testimony to the Senate Judges Committee on the alleged sexual violence of Blasy Ford.
Although this part of the programme did not go on the air, Western noise-coffees were loaded into Chris Rock's social media.
It is not clear whether the bull was trying to mock West with a message.
West also complained to the audience that he had a hard time with his hat behind the scenes.
“They were yelling at me in the back.
They said I wouldn't go in there with a hat in my head.
They were laughing at me.
And then they say that I'm in a wasted place," he said according to Washington Examer.
He went on to say: “You want to see a place where you’re drunk? I’m putting my Superman cap on, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments caused the viewers to feel at least two times at least, and it seemed that the SNL team was embarrassed. According to Varity, one person said: "All the studio remained eternal."
West was on the show last time to replace Ariana Grande, for the singer's ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
Mr. West amazed many with the song I Love it, which he looked like Perrier's bottle at the time of his presentation.
West received support from the Chairman of the Candace Turner of the Conservatory Group, who said: "To the same soul, let's hear that you're going to get the money."
But the captain, Karen Hunter, was surprised that West was just "the one who he is, and it's absolutely wonderful."
“But I decided not to reward (by buying my music or clothing or by supporting his “art”) someone who, in my opinion, believes and spreads an adverse view of the world to my community.
He's free.
Like us," he added.
Before the show, rapper said he'd changed his name, saying he's now "the former Kanye West."
He is not the first singer to change his name by following Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Lion and, of course, recently left as a musical legend, who changed his name as a symbol.

The fame of the turons game Kit Harington does not approve of masculinity.
Kit Harington is known for his sword’s flashing role in Jon Snowina HBO’s violent medieval fantasy of the Thrones game.
But actor (31) sets down an aggressive hero's stereotype, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit thought that "there has been something wrong" and raised the question of how to solve the problem of masculinity in the #Me period of Too.
Kit, who recently took part in a dialogue with Rose Leslie (31) on his role in the thrones, admitted that he was “very strong” that this problem needed attention.
“I feel, in fact, quite strongly right now that we’ve been wrong about being married,” he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up with regard to the problem that we see now?"
Who believes that television is partly responsible for the rise in masculinity, because it shows illustrious characters.
He continued: “What is congenital, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets gives young boys the feeling that they must be just as they want to be men.
I think it's really one of the biggest questions of our time - how do you change that?
Obviously something has gone wrong for the young men."
In his interview, he also admitted that after the end of the series, after the summer following the end of the summer, he would never participate in any order of the Tuns, saying that he is “on one side with his fields and horses. ”
Since November Kit Sam Shepard participated in the re-resurrection of True West, which tells a story about the filmmaker and his brother.
The actor recently suggested that she considered meeting her wife, Rose, to be the best thing about the Troon game.
“I met my wife in this series, so it gave me my future family and my future life,” she said.
The winner of Emmyga's award-winning fancier Ygritte, Kiti's character, played Jon Snow's love.
A couple married in June 2018 in Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases.
The industry has announced that the number of HIV and AIDS-based citizens has increased sharply to 14%.
According to health care professionals, more than 820 000 people suffer from this disease.
Only in the second quarter of 2018 some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most new cases have been caused by sex, making it past.
In fact , some of the blood transfusions that were infected in China started to spread .
However, in this way, the number of people infected with HIV had fallen almost to zero, and the Chinese health services confirmed at the conference in the Province of Yunnan.
Yearly, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100 000 people per year.
The spread of HIV through sex is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was regulated in China in 1997, but the distinction between LGBT people is allegedly high.
Because of the old-fashioned values of the country, research has shown that 70-90% of men who have men marry women after all.
Many sickness transfers are related to insufficient sexual protection of such relationships.
Since 2003, the Government of China has allowed the use of general access to HIV medicines to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaking of GOP's senator data by saying that these are "hazardous lies" and "supervisory theories".
Maxine Waters, representative of the United States of America, recognized on Saturday the allegations that his employee had posted personal data from three Republicans of the United States senator to the website of Wikipedia, the legislators.
Los Angeles Democrat confirmed that such claims are spread by "outside-right" trolls and their websites.
“The lies, the lies, the lies, and even more the indignant lies, ” Waters said in his Twitter statement.
The published information allegedly included home addresses and phone numbers of the U.S. senators Lindsey Graham (South Carolina) and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch (both Utah).
This was posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the hearing of the Senate on the grounds of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, the Judge of the Supreme Court.
The information was leaked shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Old-fashioned websites, such as Gateway Pundi and RedState, reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the post, was related to Waters' office and issued member information from a member of Waters employee, said Hill.
“This plea of justification is complete and absolute false,” continued Waters.
“My staff, whose personality, personal data and safety are at risk because of their fraudulent and false claims, shall in no way be liable for this disclosure of information.
This argument of justification is a complete and irrefutable lie."
Waters’ statement was quickly surveyed on the Internet, including one of the critics from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is due to anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This indicates that he has feelings that are not appropriate to a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they haven't done, they can't get angry.
They mustn't be troves.
They must not question the motives of the prosecutor.
They must remain calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the criticisms of the Democrats by Kavanaugh, who were accused by critics of being too angry at the time of Thursday's hearing.
The Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters in the interim elections, expressed his thoughts in Twitter.
“Yes, when it comes to the truth,” he said.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned “the relevant authorities of law and order about these fraudulent claims.”
"We are doing everything possible to identify criminals," he continued, "and to hold them legally responsible for all of their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Film Johnny Magyar Strikes Oncein Overview - under-responsible Rowan Atkinsson spy-pianade.
It is now common for Brexit's meanings to be sought in all the new British films, and this seems particularly relevant for Johnny English's rheostats parodories, which began in 2003 in Johnny English and was re-resurrected in 2011 by Johnny English Reborn.
Are you humorously questioning yourself on the subject of how obviously stupid we are in the new country's potential for exports?
In any case, the uncomplicated uncomplicated Magyar has been authorised to return to the case in its co-morbid manner - and that this broad comical creation is intended for non-English-speaking cinemas.
It is, of course, a secret agent who, despite his strange pretense of smee-glues, points a little bit to Clousé, a little Mr Bean and a little character who gave a tonic to Chariots of Fire's character on the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It is also based on the character traveler and the international mysterious Atkinson, who was once played in forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, which leaves nothing but chaos.
There is only one or two pleasant moments in this latest JE film.
I liked the approach of the English helicopter when he was wearing the medieval armor and the helipads of his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson’s gift to do physical comedy is shown, but the humor seems to be minor and strangely excessive, especially when “serious” spy films such as 007 and Mission Impossible are also self-evidently giving comedy.
It seems that this humor is meant for children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's clever adventures are not as resourceful and focused as Atkinson's dark films as Beanina.
At present, it is temporary to assume that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber hack has penetrated the network of top secret spies, revealing the personalities of all the secret police officers in the UK, thereby disappointing the on-the-spot agent, and unfortunately the small role played by Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, who is a solemn and troubled character who suffers from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing this great in the character of Teresa-May, but there is not much in the manuscript to do with.
His intelligence advisors suggest that, since all active spies are at risk, he must call back someone who has retired.
And that means Johnny English, who now works as a schoolmaster in a prestigious institution, giving a secret lesson on how to be a secret agent: there are a couple of good places where English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English will be flown back to Whitehall for emergency notice and will be re-introduced to his former long-term partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the master of the submarine, where actress Vicki Pepperdine's talents have been seriously wasted.
So Batman and Robin, his Majesty's secret service are back in action, in the presence of Olga Kurkölenko's embodied beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
At the same time, the Prime Minister will put a dangerously charismatic tech-Million into the hands of the Prime Minister. That is to say that he is able to solve all the British computer problems: the unhappy Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
The English and Bough start with their dyssey: by hiding themselves as a performer, they set fire to a fire; they create chaos, they cover up the luxury hunt of Vola secretly; and English launches a real deal if he tries to use the virtual reality headset to get to know the interior of the Lapa house.
There are no drivers used in this last section, but as loud as it is, the whole thing is full of children's milk.
Pretty middle stuff.
And as with other Johnny English films, I was wondering if the British Bible industry really has no role to play for Row Atkinson in relation to its talent?
The job party does not intend to draw up a plan where the Brits work for four days a week, but they are paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyni's Labour Party has considered a reverse plan that provides that the Brits work for four days a week, but are paid five days ago.
The party would like the company's superiors to pass on the expenses of the employees from the artificial intelligence revolution (AI), giving them one additional day off.
This way, workers would have a Wednesday weekend - but they would get the same salary.
Under the subheading, this idea would fit the idea of a party with an economic agenda, and so the country is planning to tilt for the benefit of workers.
The day-to-day work week has been approved by the Congress of the Union for Trade so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
The source of the work said to The Sunday Times: “It is said that the draft review will be notified before the end of the year.
“This will not take place overnight, but on a Thursday’s work week is an attempt that is consistent with the party’s approach to economic equilibrium, both for the benefit of workers and for the benefit of the party’s overall industrial strategy.
It is not the first person to support such an idea because the Green Party also allowed a Thursday week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this attempt is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
The President of the Labour Party announced: "The day-to-day work week is not a party policy and it is not discussed by the party."
Asekantsler John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party Conference to clarify his vision of a socialist transformation in the economy.
McDonnell said that he has decided to take back the power of the "honorous leaders" and "loss agents" of the public utility companies.
Asekansler's plans also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their entire participation because the Labour Party could make a "unconception" with regard to the perceived misdemeanor.
He confirmed his plan to place employees on the board of the company and to set up inclusive equity funds to provide 10% of private-sector equity employees, instead of providing annual bonuses up to EUR 561,65 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say on the "60 Myself" show, whether the examination of Füh Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh by the FBI has taken at least one week of the final vote on the application to the Supreme Court and raises the question as to whether the findings of the Bureau might affect the Republican termination of support for the senators.
In the Sunday interview, the co-Chairman Scott Pelley, Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the Bureau could reveal something that might make you change your mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“Of course,” said Kennedy.
I said, "I'm going to an interview. I said I'd talked to a fellow named KANNaugh.
I called him after he got the charges and said, "Did you do it?"
He was decisive, sure and unambiguous."
Graham's voice seems to be a rock bridge.
“I am sure of Brett Kavanaugh’s decision and could only be changed by a pommo change,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know how this happened, but I know Brett denied it forcefully,” said Graham, referring to Blasy Ford.
“And all he has named could not confirm it.
This is a 36-year-old thing.
I see nothing new coming."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and does it contribute to the reduction of poverty?
On this occasion, an annual music event will be organised by the New York Global Citizen Festival, which has an impressive presence of fame and an equally impressive goal: to eliminate poverty from the world.
For the seventh time, many thousands of people in Central Park's Great Lawn will not only enjoy the songs of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real purpose of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which was launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Government Project. It is an international advisory group who is hoping to end poverty by constantly increasing the number of people who are fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for the VIP ticket), the concerters had to perform a number of tasks or voluntary activities, send an e-mail to a world leader, call or do something important to help raise awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful has Global Citizens been if they have been 12 years to achieve their goal?
Is the idea of giving a free concert for people is the real way to convince them to act, or is it just another crucifix where people feel that they're doing something important by signing a statement on the Internet or in a tug?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have registered more than 19 million "activities" for their supporters, seeking to achieve a wide range of objectives.
According to this, these measures will help world leaders to inform more than $37 billion of commitments and policies that will affect more than 2.25 billion lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, Group 390 referred to the commitment and notification resulting from their activities, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main responsibilities include a partnership between investors and contractors in the UK The Power of Nutrition, which is dedicated to "helping children to exploit all their abilities", allowing Rwanda to provide 35 million dollars to help stop malnutrition in the country after more than 4700 floods from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the United Kingdom, the donors, national governments and universal citizens, such as you, we can transform malnutrition into a historical observation of social injustice," said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman to the public of London during the concert in April 2018.
The group also informed that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government announced on the financing project The Power of Nutrition, resulting in 5 million women and children in need of nutrition intervention.
In response to a FAQ on its website, which is asked, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizens replied: “This is a long and hard road - sometimes we fall and fail.
However, as we face great civil rights and anti-Aparthid movements, we are sure of our success, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Card B, Janelle Monae are just a few performers standing up for this year's event in New York, led by Deborra-Lee Fenness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy's "block" to prevent the Russian energy export - Minister for Foreign Affairs
According to Washington Exam, Washington may, if necessary, use its Navy to prevent the Russian energy market from being hit, including in the Middle East, by the US Minister of Foreign Affairs Ryan Zinke.
Zinke argued that Russia's presence in Syria, especially if it acts at the request of the rule of law, is a pretext for the investigation of the new energy market.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediated energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, on the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means of dealing with it.
“The United States of America has this opportunity, through our Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, prevented, in order to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he added.
Zinke's statement was addressed to participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit company that represents the US "energy consumer's voice".
He went to compare Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
“Iran and Russia’s choice is more or less, amplification and replacement of fuels,” he said, referring to Russia at the same time as the “one trick pony” whose economy is dependent on fuel.
These statements come at a time when the Government of the People's Party is responsible for increasing the export of LNG to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, the officials of the Trump Administration, including the President of the United States Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to rule out the "uncompatible" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to the words of Trump, turned Berlin into Moscow's "prisoner".
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the 11 billion dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which re-orders the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Luke claims that D.A.'s acute opposition to the project has been simply motivated by certain reasons and is an indication of unfair competition.
“I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a push tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose suppliers, ” said the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Aleksandr Novav at a meeting in Moscow in September with the US Minister of Energy Rick Perry.
The US position has been struck back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The German leading industrial organisation, the German Labour Union (Bdi) called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements in Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a major problem for me when a third country intervenes in our energy supply, ” said the German President of the Association of Industry (BDI) Dieter Kempf, following the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Mr. Warren is seriously considering running for president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts.
Senator of Massachusetts, Mr. Warren, on Saturday, said that he was seriously considering running for president during the interim elections.
Holyoke Town Hall Massachusetts confirmed Warren's assessment of his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and improve our broken government, including the first lady,” he said.
"After 6 November, I seriously consider running for president."
Warren also evaluated the activities of President Donald Tõmp in the Town Hall, saying that "the country is heading in the wrong direction.
“I am seriously concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Mr. Warren has expressed criticism for Mr. Trump and the candidate for the Supreme Court, Mr. Brett Kévanaugh.
Friday said Warren: “We naturally need to study before we vote.”
However, the survey published on Tuesday showed that most Warren's own voters do not think he should apply for in 2020.
According to a study of the University of Suffolk's political research centre/Boston Globe, 58% of the "potential" voters of Massachusetts thought that the senator should not be running for office.
32% supported such a candidate.
The survey showed more support for the ex-Governor Deval Patrick candidacy, 38% supported the possibility of running and 48% opposed it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with possible 2020 candidates include former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that the formal decision by January was announced by the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Donald Assembled from the Assembly Track Palin tSDs.
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after September recruitment.
He was arrested on a Monday evening in the case of domestic violence and was accused of being arrested.
“What my son is going through is what he is experiencing when he comes back, I can relate to other families who know the PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers return to,” he told the audience about Donald Sõmp’s gathering in Tulsa in the Gulf.
Palin called on his son to be arrested in the "Evary Room" and said with regard to his son and other war veterans that "they will come back a little differently, they will come back as exiles, they will come back thinking about whether there is enough respect for what the soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the state."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla in Alaska and Dan Bennett, the press representative of the Wasilla police department, said that he was accused of domestic violence against women, of involving domestic violence in the report and in possession of a weapon in a drunk state.
The 18th State and the Columbia Region are challenging the new asylum policy.
Eight countries and the Columbia region support the legal challenge of a new US policy that prohibits asylum for victims who escape from gangs or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives of 18 countries and the region submitted a brief statement of their friends in Washington, Washington, to support the call for asylum policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the applicant Grace v Sessions suite, which was issued by the United States Civil Liberties Union in August against the Union's policies, has not been published.
The woman said that her fellow "and her violent gang members' sons" abused her, but the US officials did not accept her application for asylum on 20 July.
He was caught in a mess.
The state lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and as countries producing a large number of US asylum seekers, among which gangs and domestic violence are a major problem.
The new US asylum policy turned the decision of the Council of Appeal of migrants in 2014, which allowed undocumented immigrants to escape from domestic violence in order to apply for asylum.
In his statement on Friday, the Chief Prosecutor-General of the Democratic Region, Karl Racine, stated that the new policy “is not bound by for decades by national, Union and international law. ”
“The Federal Law requires all applications for asylum to be resolved in accordance with the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and this requirement infringes this principle,” stated the brief statement of the judges.
In a brief statement, the politicians also argued that the ban on the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the US economy, saying that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they are “provoking the right workforce. ”
The Advocate General, Jeff Sessions, asked the immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims who fled the violence of domestic abuse and gangs.
“The request for asylum is available to those who leave the country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or a particular social group or political opinion,” said Sessions in its Communication of 11 June.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day.
Fun rescue operations In a request where the deaths have been reversed in the fight against the survival of the survivors.
The survivors were increasingly threatened by the situation.
“The situation is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who comforted her in her fever at the town’s evacuation centre of the town of Palu, which was swept up in a small son of a fever.
“A new person arrives every minute with an ambulance.
There's not enough fresh water."
The inhabitants returned to their destroyed homes, sorting out broken things and trying to save everything they did.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7th Magnificent earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including those in Dwi Haris, which was on the back and upper arm of the broken back and upper arm, were rested outside the Palu's arch hospital, where patients were treated for continued severe post-mortems in the field.
The tears filled his eyes when he recalled how a strong earthquake shook him into his fifth-story hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“It has been a long time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed against the wall in the past," Haris Associated Press told him, adding that his family had come to the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're not in danger."
The U.S. ambassador is accusing China of "abusing acts of instigation with advertising".
A week after the official newspaper of the United States of America published four pages of advertising under the US Sunday news about the mutual mutual benefit of US-China trade, the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using American press to promote propaganda.
President Donald Trump of the United States of America referred last Wednesday to the addition by China Daily in the Des Moines Register - Iowa state's largest copy in the newspaper - after China was accused of taking part in the elections in the United States of America on 6 November, which, on the other hand, is denied by China.
The fact that the Chinese tried to intervene in the US elections marked what the US officials described to the Reuters as a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China was a sign of what was described by the US officials as a new stage.
Although it is common for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now in a growing trade war, in which each other's import tariffs are adjusted.
China's countermeasures at the beginning of the tariff war were intended to catch States like Iowa's exporters, as they supported the parties of the Republic of China, has been explained by experts from China and the United States.
US Ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor, as well as the largest exporter of agricultural products in China, Terry Branstad, said that China has damaged workers, farmers and businesses in the United States.
Branstad, in a Sunday's opinion by Des Moines Register, wrote: "China has now reorganised its torture by publishing ads of ads in our free press."
“In the spread of own propaganda, the government of the United States is using the American precious freedom of expression and free press practice, putting its own paid advertising in Des Moines Register,” said Branstad.
“On the other hand, there are only a limited number of votes and there is no real difference in opinion that the Chinese people can have about an alarming economic direction, given that the media is under the firm hand of the Communist Party of China,” he added.
He added that one of the most outstanding Chinese newspapers refused to publish his article, but he did not say what the newspaper was about.
Analysts warn that Republicans are transferring female voters to Kavanaugh fiasco before the interim elections.
While many Republicans are waiting and defending the Supreme Court's representative Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual attacks, the analyst has warned that they will be watching a setback during the forthcoming interim elections, especially from women.
The feelings surrounding the situation have been in the ceiling, and most of the Republics have already shown that they want to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be withdrawn," said Grant Reeher, Professor of Political Sciences at Maxwell School, University of Syracus, in his Saturday article to The Hill.
Reeher expressed doubts that the last-minute attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizia) in connection with the investigation into the FBI was sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget it tomorrow or November,” said the Progressive Group of MoveOn Senior Adviser and the National Representative Karine Jean-Pierre Washington DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, the protestors repeated their protests on November is coming! in their Senate corridor because the Republicans, who are reviewing the judges' committees, decided to proceed with the Kavanaugh candidacy, despite Dr. Blasy Ford's testimony, announced Mic.
“Democratic Instinct and Instinct Confidence is beginning to fall out of the loop,” said an informal political analysis by Stu Rothenberg on the news.
“ People say it’s high, it’s true.
However, it may be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18-29 years who do not like and often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony, which described his allegations of sexual assault against the candidate of the Supreme Court, the analysis predicted a setback as the Republicans were moving forward with confirmation.
“It has become very confusing for GOP,” said Michael Steele NBC News, Chairman of the National Committee of Republics at the beginning of last week’s president, Michael Steele NBC News.
“This does not only concern the vote of the Commission, the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is to be appointed, it also concerns the way the Republics have dealt with it, and how they have treated it,” said Guy Cecil, Head of the News Service, Priorities of the United States (a group that helps to choose the Democrats) of the United States.
The Americans seem to be somewhat divided, believing in Ford after the testimony, and who Kavanaugh, but with a little more support, support the first one.
YouGov's new survey showed that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed in Ford's testimony, whereas 35% said that they were sure or probably believed in Kaunaghi.
In addition, 38% said that they think that Kavanaugh has probably or surely lied during his testimony, whereas only 30% thought the same about Ford.
Thanks to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's claims and at least one other charge against Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford admitted last week to the Senate judge committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed him his genitals when they attended one party during his study at Yale in 1980.
The inventor of World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet that would blow up Google and Facebook on top of the Internet.
The World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee launched a start-up company that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technology delegation Inrupt is a company that builds an open source platform for Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons have been given access to information.
In an exceptional interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made fun of the fact that the purpose of Inrupt was “governance of the world”.
"We have to do this now," he said about the start-up company.
“This is a historic moment.”
Use Solid technology to enable people to create their own "Personal online database" or Pod.
It may include contact lists, job lists, calendar, library and other personal and competent tools.
It is like Google Drive, PORT, Slack and Spotify, which is all available in one browser and at the same time.
This personal online database makes it unique for the user to choose who can access this information.
The company calls it "the personal mandate through data".
According to John Bruce, company manager, the Inrupt idea is that the company would bring sources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid make available to everyone.
Today, the company consists of a security platform purchased from Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some developers hired to work on the basis of a contract, and a voluntary coder community.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications, using the resources available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not talk to "Facebook and Google, whether to bring in a complete change if all their business models are fully supported overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In the press release on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the aim of the Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and the ecosystem to help protect the new web integrity and quality created by Solidi."
In 1994 Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an effective voice in the debate on the network's vote in favour.
The Intruder will be the founder and director of the Berners-Lee World Wide Web consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely optimistic about the next time,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A spiritual monument was opened in World War I that was crucified by Victoria’s Cross in World War I.
The Church of England, which was baptized in Victoria during the first World War, celebrated its 100th anniversary in its home town.
Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann fought for his award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But he died four days later by a sniper and did not know that he had received the highest British army's prize.
His two sons opened a monument on Saturdays in Urhden, Northamptonshire.
One of his sons, Michael Vann, said that it would be “genomically symbolic” if the stone opened exactly 100 years after Grandpa’s award-winning battle.
According to the London Gazette, Colonel Vann, on 29 September 1918, led his Battalion over to Canal de Saint-Quentin "as well as very thick mute and gun-guns and machine-gun ammunition."
He later rushed into the line of attack and carried it forward with the "greatest guerrilla" before he rushed to one of the gunfighters by himself and knocked three opponents out.
Colonel Vanni killed German sniper on 4 October 1918 - when only a few more than a month remained until the end of the war.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's activity was "what I know I can never repeat, but for which I will always be grateful."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a parade after a parade led by Brentwood’s congenial youth band.
Michael Vann said that he has “a great honour to be in this parade” and added that “the presence and support of so many people shows that a true hero can be assessed.”
MMA fans were Bellator 236 to watch up all night, but only looked at the Põhsas Peppas.
Imagine you've been up all night looking at Bellator 206, but this main event is not going to show you.
San Jose match included 13 fights, including six main cards, and it was shown in the United Kingdom on channel 5 live all night.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousas and Rory MacDonald prepared to stick their breasts with each other, the viewers of the United Kingdom kept their mouths shut because they were on the screen in the Persian Peppa.
Not much of it was inspired, especially those who had remained awake until early hours to see this fight.
One fan described the transition to children's comics as "a hurt hurt" in Twitter.
“This is a government rule that the content at 6.00 was no longer appropriate and they had to switch to the child’s program,” explained Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Bellator, on marketing and communication matters when asked about the transfer.
""Peppa peppa", yeah."
President Scott Coker of the Bellator said that they intend to work on drawing up their schedule in order to take more account of the viewers of the United Kingdom in the future.
“When I think about the performance again, I think we can solve this problem in the future,” Coker said.
“But if it’s 6 a.m. Sunday morning there, then we can’t do it until this Sunday is their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, there was a lot of back and forth text and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't, it was a government rule.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We show a reference - as we usually do - instead of a six-way fight, we tried to offer fans more, and we just went over time.
This is a terrible situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt as a part of sexuality as a "low value".
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up feeling that he was inferior to others because of his own sexuality - but it gave him motivation to succeed.
A 24-year-old young man said that he didn't realize "everybody is not like him" until he went to high school.
At Laren Laverne Radio 4, on Desert Island Discs, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
Getting a parent changed his attitude towards winning the Olympic Games, giving him the feeling that it is no longer so important.
You would receive a regular long-term escort, Kirsty Young, who had to take a few months off due to his illness.
On Laverne's first show, Daley said that she felt less valuable when she grew up than anyone else because it was not socially acceptable when you liked boys and girls.
He said: “To this day, these feelings are that I am not worthy and feel different, giving me the power and strength to succeed.”
He tried to prove that he was worth something, and did not disappoint anyone else when they finally learned about his sexuality.
A second Bronze-Olympic winner has become the leader of the highly valued LGBT campaign, using its appearance at the United Nations Games of this year in Australia to address more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he was talking about the fact that he was lucky that he could survive without cause and that he wanted to give hope to others as well.
The third world champion said that falling in love with a man - U.S. scholar Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was a surprise to him."
Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years later last year, but he said that the age difference has never been a problem.
"When you're so young," he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - it was hard to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
A couple became parents in June, with a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley saying that his "total outlook" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, everything was about winning the gold medal,” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after he was diagnosed as a brain tumor.
Daley said that his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked for was that if they had tickets to London in 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him that "Dad, you can't sit in the front row because you're not there by this time," he said.
“I held her hand when she stopped breathing, and only after she had actually stopped breathing and died, I finally admitted that she was not undefeated,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life—diving in front of the home crowd in the Olympic Games, that’s not a better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first song - Heather Small Proud - which helped him prepare for the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs is the BBC Radio 4 on the air on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of the uniform, Mickelson was removed from the game on Saturday at the Ryder Cup.
The American Phil Mickelson makes a daily record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he needs to correct his format in order to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mr. Mickelson, who plays record 12 times at every two years’ event, was removed from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for the last few and four balls of the week.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as he has often been for the US, the last winner divided his day into two, being a pain in the ass and working on his game, hoping to improve it.
Never the most direct blower, even at the peak of his career, is a 48-year-old especially fit to play on a narrow Le Golf National golf course where a long rough track punishes a persistent misfortune.
And if the field itself is not scary enough, Mickelson will be standing on Sunday, in his ninth contest with the Master Francesco Molinar of the British Open, who has joined the army at the beginning with Fleetwood to win all four competitions this week.
If the Americans, who are behind four points at the beginning of the 12 singles, start on fire, the Mickelson Competition may be extremely important.
Fühk expressed confidence in his husband, but he did not have much else to add.
“He fully understood his part of today, threw me on my shoulder, put his hand around my shoulder and said he was ready for tomorrow,” added Furyk.
“He is very self-sufficient.
He's a celebrity, and he's given as much to our teams as he did in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't see him play any second game.
I anticipated more, but I did, and we had to choose this way.
He wants to be out, like everyone else."
Mickelson passes Nick Faldo's record on Sunday as the player most participating in Ryder Cup games.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, which, however, has never answered his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 winners, 20 losses and seven weeks, but Furyk said that his presence has made a further contribution to the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he's smart, he likes to have fun with people, and he's just great in the team room," he explained.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun going against him this week and it was nice to see.
It offers more than just a game."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great success can soon disappear.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows from his experience that the great leadership of Ryder Cup’s last day at the beginning of the match can easily become an unpleasant experience.
The Danish took part in a competition in Valderama in 1997, where, along with Captain Seve Ballesteros, the Americans were held a five-point lead, but at the end of the finish line, it had fallen dramatically, and the victory was only won with a result :
“You will remember that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we also had great success in Brookline, where we lost and in Valderrama, where we won, the victory was very close,” said Bjorn in the picture after Class of 2018 won 5 : 3 Friday and with yesterday’s success 10 : 6 Leghtis.
So history shows me and the whole team that it can happen again.
You're going to do your best tomorrow.
You go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have a point on it.
We have a goal, which is to win the cup, and so let's focus on it.
I've been telling you all along, I'm focusing on 12 players who are on our side, but we're very aware of who our opponents are - the best players in the world."
Affirmative of how his players have played on this heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I am not going to rush forward on this matter.
Tomorrow, there are completely new obstacles.
Tomorrow, personal performances will read and so it will be something else.
It's nice to be with the opponent, when things are going well, but if you're there personally, you're being tested as a full ball player.
This is the message you need to pass on to the players - do your best.
Now that you leave your partner behind, he must also go and do his own thing."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk expects his players to act better in person than with the opponents, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who received three of the four points.
In the last few days, Furyk himself has experienced both of them, being part of the team of the Russians' victory before being part of the loss before Europe defeated the miracle of Medinah.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how, in 1999, Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to play all their games the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you must start with fire, like Brookline and like Medish.
If the pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the average competitions.
We set up our team in accordance with our team and put boys in the field in a way where we feel that this will be a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to run the competition and he is the best in the face of Rory McIlroy, with Paul, Justin Rose, Jon Rahmi, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the best Europeans in the competition.
“I put my boys in that line, because I think that’s how we’re covered,” Bjorn said about his choice of single games.
The new warship of Germany was delayed again.
The German Navy's newest high-speed sailboat should have been introduced in 2014, replacing the warships of the old Cold War, but this will not happen until next year due to the damaged systems and the increased costs of snowballing, the local media reported.
The introduction of the new Baden-Wuertemberg class of the high-speed sailboat ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ has now been postponed in accordance with the military press release published in Die Zeit in the first half of 2019.
The ship should have joined the Navy already in 2014, but the worrying post-transmission problems did not make it easy for this ambitious project to happen.
Four ships of the Baden-Wurttembergi class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen class with the fast-tracks of the old Bremen class.
It is understandable that they have a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some shielding technologies, such as reducing radar, infrared and hearing signals.
Other important options include longer maintenance periods - the latest express operations should be able to be sent out of the country of origin for up to two years.
Long-term delays, however, mean that state-of-the-art warships - which allow Germany to strengthen its power abroad - will become obsolete by the time it is set up for service.
A failed F155 high-speed sailboat appeared in the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Firdi Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This was the first time that the Navy had sent the ship back to the shipowner after it had received it.
The reasons for the return were not known, but the German media quoted a number of important "software and hardware shortages" that made the warship inoperable if they had been used during the battle.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class is managed by a team of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce of the older Bremen class of high-speed sailboats.
It also found that the ship was significantly overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the capacity of the Navy to contribute to future innovations.
The 7000-tonne ‘Rheinland-Pfalz’ is probably twice as heavy as the class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project, including the training of a test, will also become a problem in addition to the damaged hardware.
It is said that it amounts to EUR 3.1 billion (EUR 3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion initially.
The problems related to the latest express operations are becoming particularly important in the light of recent warnings that the German Navy's power is changing.
At the beginning of the year, the German Parliament's Chairman of the Committee on Defence, Hans-Peter Bartels, admitted that the Navy was actually "driving out of eligible ships."
The official said that this issue has grown as a snowball over time, because old ships were removed, but no replacement ship arrived.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuertsemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The common Trust explores the mystery of bats' secrets.
The aim of the new study carried out in the Scottish Mountains is to reveal how bats use the landscape to find their food.
It is hoped that the results will give new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help direct future protective measures.
In the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross, Scotland’s National Trust scientists’ research monitors the usual and soprano pies in Scotland’s National Trust, as well as the long-legged and daubent’s bat.
Special recorders shall be placed in the main locations of the area to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also carry out field studies using handheld sensors.
The competent assessment of all recordings determines the frequency of bat calls and the nature of the activities of the species.
A map of habitats and a report will then be created to create a detailed landscape view of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar hopes that the results will show which habitats are the most important for bats and how different species use them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bats have lost a lot of ambition in the 20th century.
There is a danger of construction and development that will affect their habitats and their loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also be a threat, such as flying papers and chemical treatment of some construction materials, as well as attacks on pet cats.
The bats aren't really blind.
But their hunting at night makes their ears more beneficial than their eyes to catch the prey.
They shall use complex echo locations to identify insects and obstacles to their flight pathogens.
Throughout the country more than 27 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land maintenance NTS takes bat mice very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who carry out regular studies, surveys and sometimes saves.
The Organization has even created the first and only special batry reef in Scotland in Three in Dumfrie and Galloway, where eight of the ten bat species of Scotland are present.
The real estate manager David Thompson says that this area is an ideal territory for them.
“In Threeve we have a large area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a great habitat.
But there is still much to be discovered about bats, so the work that we do here and in other areas will help us to understand better what they need."
He stresses the importance of checking bats before starting maintenance on the property, as the unwanted destruction of one place of breeding and giving birth can kill up to 400 mothers and young people, and even destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and killing, disrupting or destroying them is illegal.
Scottish Officer Elisabeth Ferrell of the Association for the Protection of Bats has encouraged the public to contribute to the protection of bats.
He said: “We still have so much to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know many of our species and how their populations feed.”
Ronaldo rejects the rape charges, while lawyers intend to sue the German press court.
Cristiano Ronaldo has rejected the rape charges against him as a "federal news", saying that people "wanted to promote themselves", using his name.
His lawyers intend to refer charges to the Court of Justice of the German newspaper Der Giegel, who published the newspaper Der Giegel.
The perpetrator of Portugal and the Declaration has been accused of rapeing American Kathryn Mayorga in the Las Vegas Hotel Room in 2009.
He has allegedly paid the female population EUR 330 643,10 to keep the incident out of the question, reported Der Giegel on Friday.
As Ronaldo (33) was informed that it was “magic news” in a direct video of his 142 million observers a hour after the charges.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Today is a false news story," said the last winner of Ballo d'Ori on the news.
They want to advertise themselves by my name.
It's real. It's real.
They want to be famous with my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and I'm fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to refer Der Spigeel to the Court of Justice for a case relating to ‘an unauthorised statement of suspicion of privacy’.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said that the player claims compensation “for the damage caused by moral harm, which corresponds to the seriousness of the infringement, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in a suite in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's hotel room, where they claimed to have been raped on the basis of documents submitted in Nevada, following the district court in Clark County.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was “99 good men”, of whom “one percentage fails to fail”.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed a couple of sexual relations, but it was not unanimous.
Mayorga also claims that he went to the police and took photos of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court solution because he feared "for a bribe" and was concerned about "the public humiliation".
Now the 34-year-old woman says that she is now trying to reverse the solution because the alleged case continues to trauma her.
Ronaldo had left U.S. and joined Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italy with a huge Juve transaction of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The UK may begin to regret the departure of car manufacturers forever.
The United Kingdom would ‘forever’ if it lost its position as world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Secretary General Clark.
He added that the Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the United Kingdom left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop their production at the factory near Derby in Bernaston.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of border crossings without the Brixite agreement could be affected by jobs.
To Burnsta factory, where the vehicles are manufactured in Tokyo Auris and Avens, nearly 150,000 cars were produced last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that when the United Kingdom starts to leave the EU at the end of March, we will see a stop to the production process in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Executive Director of Bernastoni Tokyo.
Other car manufacturers in the United Kingdom have also been afraid of leaving the EU without an agreement, worrying about the operation of interoperability trade, including Honda, är and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, it says that the Mini factory in Oxford closes the factory after Brexit for one month.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to supply chain risks in the absence of a Brixt agreement.
The Tokyo production line shall operate as necessary, where spare parts arrive from both the United Kingdom and the EU every 37 minutes.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement of 29 March, the border may be affected by circumstances which, according to the industry, could cause delays and deficiencies in parts.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than one day of stock in its Derbyshire plant, which means that production must be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May Chequers’ position on future EU relations was “to be exact in order to avoid such checks at the border.”
“We want an agreement. We want the best solution that would allow us to do what we want, and not only use the current success, but take the opportunity,” he told the BBC Radio 4 to Today.
"The fact that not only in Tokyo but also in other producers shows that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain set."
Toyato could not say how long production will be stopped, but in the longer term warned that additional costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately pay jobs.
Peter Ts Republicris, a representative of the Unite Trade Union who worked in Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “We know from our experience that when jobs disappear, they will not come back.
The President of the Government said: “We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
A more successful meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says the White House.
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week, as the fight against the highest-level candidate Brett Kavanaugh announced on Sunday of the White House.
Rosenstein will monitor the work of Special Commissioner Robert Mueller, who will investigate the intervention of the Russian elections, the link between the assistants of the Trump and Russia, and the prevention of possible justice by the President.
Whether Trump fires the Deputy Prosecutor General and thus threatens Mueller's independence, has been interrupting Washington rumors for several months.
At the beginning of this month, the New York Times announced that Rosenstein discussed with Trump the use of interceptors for recording conversations and the possibility of removing the President through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm that.
Last Monday he went to the White House, informing me he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with the Olympics, which was then announced in New York at the United Nations at the time.
Trump said he didn't want to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed in order to avoid a coincidence with the hearing of the Senate judge's committee, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Blasy Ford, both of them gave a confession.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, postponing the Senate vote.
The dynamic pressman, Mrs Sanders, appeared in the Fox News on Sunday.
If he was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein: “This date has not yet been set, it may be this week, but it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the matters relating to the Supreme Court.
But let's look at this and keep the press informed as usual."
Some journalists would challenge this argument: Sanders has not held a press conference on the White House since 10 September.
Captain Chris Office asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of information was not the result of a disappointment for TV journalists on purpose, although he added: “I do not object to the fact that they are disappointed.”
Then he recommended a direct contact between Trump and the press.
The President will take more questions and answers than any President before him," he said, without adding evidence: "We have looked at these numbers."
The hours continue, Sanders confirmed, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly questions, it is much better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot, and you've seen how we've done this over the past few weeks, so it's going to take place during a press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open meetings or press conferences with guests.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President, in other words, expressed his appreciation for why, having been pre-assembled by the assembled journalists on leave and sometimes with a strange appearance .
The Minister for Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland regarding the fears of Brexit.
The Minister for Health has written to EU workers working in the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish their rest after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent his letter if the UK left the EU for less than six months.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of a status established for EU citizens working in its public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: “In the summer, negotiations have continued on the United Kingdom’s and EU’s return, heading towards its expected decisions in the autumn.
The United Kingdom Government has also prepared preparations for a possible non-contractual scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for you.
This is why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of its nationality.
Professional partners from all over the EU and elsewhere will bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care work and benefit patients and communities serving our services.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercromony passed after the major trauma emergency surgery.
The player of Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercromie passed an emergency operation after a head injury and a hit 31 : 27 Vanderbilt from the Commodores, published by Tennessee Mike Organ.
Coach Rod Reed of Tennessee State told the journalist that the injury had occurred just before the halftime.
“ He fell down on his face and just collapsed, ” Reed said.
Coachs and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen when he was on board before he was placed on the frame for further inspection off the field for further inspection.
The Tennessee State official spoke to Chris Harris (WSMV - Nashville, Tennessee) about how Abercromie's operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center has ended.
Harris added that there are no details on the type/range of the injury and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student with a red shirt, was in Tennessee State during his first season after coming over from Illinois.
He had five battles on Saturday before leaving the game, which totaled 18 matches this season.
In the UK, foreign buyers are required to pay a higher retail charge for the purchase of real estate in the UK.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp charges when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this additional money to help homeless people under new Tory plans.
This step will damage Corbyni’s efforts to attract young voters.
Intangible tax is taxed on those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to create up to GBP 120 million per year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher temp rate when they buy real estate in the United Kingdom, using this extra to help the homeless, reported today that Theresa May.
The movement is considered to be an attempt to damage the efforts made by Corbyn to attract young voters with promises to offer them an affordable living space and to target high-income people.
Intangible taxes are imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, providing additional money for government's desire to fight homelessness.
The premium, which is in addition to this stamp fee, including the higher levels set two years ago for the second home and for the advance payments, may be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this movement to generate a maximum of GBP 120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the purchased London properties belong to non-UK residents, which increase prices and make it difficult for the first buyers to get a foothold when buying housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "global cities" due to a large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.
This policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the temple tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of holding high real-estate prices when they bought land but did not use it, and he invited May to give up quotas for private homes in order to correct the “mistake of living in the UK”.
Corbyn has announced an admirable housing reform, including a rent check and an end to the torture of innocent people.
He also wishes to give the councils greater power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year, I promised to return to the British dream as Prime Minister - that life would be better for each other’s future.
And that means improving our broken internal market.
There are always open people who want to live here, work and build their own lives here.
However, it is not true that individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as businesses abroad, have the same ease of buying homes as the British people who work hard for them.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has become too far away and harsh sleep conditions are usually real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland.”
Mr. Sunderlan's leader, Jack Ross, says that his "final goal" is to be the leader of Scotland at some point in time.
(42) The Scotsian (42) welcomes the challenge of reinvigorating the North-Eel Club, which is currently in the third position in League One, with only 3 points behind it.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Champions League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I knew class B and it was all about it," said Ross BBC on Scotland Sportsound.
“But I grew up with my father looking at Scotland in Hampden, and that’s always something that has drawn me back.
However, this option will only come if I am successful in the management of the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's leader have been Dick Advoat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Cano.
Former Head of Alloo Athletic says that he did not feel the fear of such great and famous names, having previously endured both Barnsleys and Ipwich Town.
"For me, success is now being able to take this club to the Champions League."
Due to its structure and its establishment, this club is undoubtedly part of the Masters League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get there, but I only seem to be successful if I manage to get the club back there.”
Ross has worked as a manager for only three years, having previously been the Deputy Director of Dubrovnik and 15 months among Hearts' leading personnel.
He then helped Aloto re-enter the third level and turned St Mirren's lowest position into the winner of the next championship.
And Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than he was in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“This was a true crossroads,” he recalled to Alla’s transposition.
“I really thought management was more appropriate to me than playing.
It seems strange, because I did it, I got a reasonable income and enjoyed some peaks.
Playin' can be tough.
There are many things that need to be done weekly.
I still experience it in terms of the pressure and pressure of my work, but the management just seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to lead, and now I'm doing it, and I feel more comfortable right now than ever when I was a grown-up."

According to the study, the best time for a level is Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has improved British Pubs' turnover in trouble, but increased pressure has been generated on chain stores.
The figures showed that the turnover of pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, but that the turnover of restaurants fell by 4.8% in July.
These figures were compiled by CGA representative of CGA, Peter Martin: “The continued presence of sunlight and England in the World Cup Championships meant that July was like June, when the turnover of pubs grew by 2.8 per cent, except that it was even harder at restaurants.
In June, 1.8% of the reduced restaurant trade deteriorated even further in July.
Drink-based pubs and bars were the most successful in trade, and the worst in trying to please restaurants is the worst in the world.
Food-based pubs also suffered despite the sun, although not as dramatically as farmers.
It seems that people just want to go out and drink.
The sales of drinks between controlled pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, an analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: “These results continue to be the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The climate and the effects of large social or sports events remain the biggest factor in sales outside the domestic market.
It is no doubt that the markets will continue to fight, although the fall in sales of 4.8% compared to last year is particularly painful in addition to the current price pressure.
The long and hot summer could not have come for food business operators at a worse time and only the time will show if the most moderate conditions we have experienced in the past are a measure of relief."
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown of trade-related agencies.
Coffer Peach Tracker's sales monitor in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses the performance data of 47 operational groups with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion and is a benchmark for the established price.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
The study concluded that one in five children, some of them 11 years old, had secret social media accounts that they were hiding from their parents and teachers.
A study conducted among 20,000 gynaecists has shown growth of "võlts Insta" leaves.
The fear of posting sexual content was heightened by the fear that mail would be posted.
Twenty per cent of the students said that they had a "basic account" intended to be shown to parents.
The study has resulted in one in five, some of them being only 11 years old, creating secret social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study conducted among 20,000 gynaecists showed a marked increase in the “võlts Insta” accounts (reference to the page on which pictures are shared).
The fear of posting sexual content was heightened by fear.
Twenty per cent of the students said that they have both a basic account intended to be shown to parents and a “basic account” made acceptable to themselves.
One of the discoverys of the secret paper of his 13-year-old daughter saw that a teenager invited others to rape him.
Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Head-Tiers' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of the 11-18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted the existence of personal accounts.
The HMC leader, Mike Buchanan, said: “It is disturbing to see that so many teenagers are tempted to create accounts online where parents and teachers do not find them.”
Eilith Doyle will be the chairman of the Scottish Athlets Board of Scottish Athlets for athletes.
Eilith Doyle was elected non-representative director of the management management at the annual meeting of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most praiseable performer in Scotland, and President Ian Beatie described this as an opportunity for sports drivers to benefit from his wide international experience in the last decade.
“Eilith is respected everywhere in Scotland, the UK and other sports community, and we are sure that Scottish athletes will benefit from the calling of his leadership,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I would like to be an athlete speaker and hope that I can contribute to the Scottish sport in real terms and contribute to its development."
An American who won four olympic gold at the Atlanta Olympic Games of 1996 at 200 metres and 400 metres in total and now often shares his opinion in the BBC, was unable to fight after a transitical ischemic attack.
He wrote: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that whether I am going to be re-expressed and, if, to what extent, only the time will show.
I've worked hard, but I've recovered fully, I've learned to walk again, and I'm already working on speed training.
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
The breast pump poster, which compares women with cows, divides the internet into two.
The breast pump company has shared on the Internet two camp advertisings comparing breast-feeding mother milking cows with the same type of cow.
According to stories, in order to celebrate the presentation of “the world’s first silent breast pump”, a consumer-oriented technology company, Elvie, published a similar advertising of ironic music to present the freedom that this new pump gives to the mothers who want to come out.
Four real mothers say in a pot-filled barn with cows and sing, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see my tail" and, "If you haven't noticed, they're not hoes, they're my breasts."
Repeated verse: "Pump, pump, feed the child, pump, pump, milk fill my lady's baby."
The advertising published on the company's Facebook page has created conflicting opinions on the Internet.
77,000 times viewed and with a number of comments, video viewers disagree. Many of them say that it illuminates the tents of the dairy industry.
“The use of cows to promote this product was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to become pregnant and give birth for milk production, but the difference is that children are stolen from them within the count days after birth," wrote one.
Elevator does not stab the breast-feeding eye (Elvie/Mother) from the Elevator.
Another commentist said: “Absolutely traumatic for both mother and child.
But why not use these children to promote the breast pumping of mothers who have kept them?'
Addendum: Totally inescapable of advertising."
It's a part of the commercial, but one of the women's stories is funny.
“I find that this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one of these if I was still breast-feeding.
The milk pumping made me feel like a complete cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but let's do it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: “This is fun for mothers who pump and know themselves as cows, often in their own workplaces or toilets.
This advertising does not boast or condemn the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discovers that they are all waltzed into bras with no overtuned pumps.
The idea of the campaign is based on the saying that many women who pump milk from their breasts feel like a cow.
Elvie Pump is completely quiet, there are no wires or pipes and does not look like a mammal, giving women freedom to move, to keep children and even to go outdoors during pumping.
She’s partner and ECD Ana Balarin commented: “Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserved a bold and irritable presentation.
We wanted to highlight breast pumping and all the challenges of women's expression and the comparison of dairy cows, while presenting in a entertaining and familiar way the extraordinary sense of dignity created by the new pump.
This is not the first time that the news has reflected Elvis's pump.
During London’s fashion week, the mother of two children, bearing the product of Marta Jakubowski, appeared on the screen.
Thousands of children of migrants went quietly across the tent camp.
The number of children of arrested migrants has increased sharply, although the monthly border crossings have remained quite the same. Partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies enforced by the Trump administrator have made it difficult to establish children with the help of sponsors.
Usually, most sponsors are documented immigrants and have been afraid to violate the possibility of staying in their country, requiring the custody of a child.
The threat changed in June, when the national authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household-owned adults would be able to provide fingerprints and data shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, the senior immigration and customs officer Matthew Albence admitted to the Congress that the Agency arrested a dozen people who requested financial support from non-inclusion minors.
The Agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the arresters were missing a criminal record.
“About 80 per cent of sponsors or sponsors of households are illegally present in the country and a large number of them are in a criminal background.
So let's keep tracking them," said Mr. Albence.
For the purpose of dealing with children more effectively, officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of the arrest.
Many people protect their legal content from the judge by videoconference, coming back.
The ineligible persons are sent out of the country quickly.
The longer the child is in custody, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which may lead to violent protests or attempts to escape, the more likely they will be to become under arrest, based on reports published by the asylum staff and in recent months.
According to the ministers, these concerns are more current in large detention facilities, such as Tornillo, where the weight of the child’s falling into the difficulties may be the same as the size of the two.
They added that moving children into a tent town without leaving enough time to get used to or say goodbye to friends could cause a trauma that many people are already in trouble with.
Syria requires the US, French and Turkish recruitment forces to leave immediately.
Foreign Minister Burid al-Moulem invited Russian refugees to come home at the United Nations General Assembly, despite the fact that the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Moulemi, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that the Foreign Forces were on the surface of Syria on an illegal pretext of terrorist attack and will be dealt with accordingly.
“They must leave immediately and unconditionally, he said at the Assembly.
Moulem claimed that Syria “the war against terrorism is almost over. Since 2011, more than 360 000 people have died and millions have left their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to "combat in this holy war until we have cleansed the entire Syrian territory", both of the joint ventures and of "any illegal foreign force present."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both the Kurdish units and the Syrian Arab Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
In France, more than 1000 troops have been exterminated from war in the country.
Speaking of war refugees, Moulalem said that the conditions for their return were appropriate and accused the inconceivable fears of preventing refugees from coming to spread to the provinces.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to help their faces," he said.
"These policies are something that is merely a humanitarian problem."
The United States of America and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be given rehabilitation aid until there is no termination agreement between Assad and the opposition.
According to the UN diplomats, the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey, creating the last insurrectionary base in the Idlib buffer zone, has created a way forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish Agreement prevented the widespread conflict of the Russian supported forces in the province of three million inhabitants.
However, Moulalem emphasised that there are “extreme deadlines” in the agreement and expressed the hope that military action would hit the Jihadists, including Al-Qaedada, related to the Nusra Front warriors who would “kill”.
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura is about to persuade the new Committee of Government and Opponents to draft the post-war Constitutional Constitution and to pave the way for the election with its first meetings.
Moulem put forward requests for the participation of the Government of Syria in the Committee, saying that the work of the panel could be limited to reviewing the articles of the current Constitution and warned against interference.
Choose Trump for another term as well.

It is not surprising that division 17 of Pennsylvania will receive cash flow thanks to the restructuring of the Congressional Region by receiving two market players at the same time.
As a result, the number of the President of the Pittsburgh District of the suburbs from the Democratic Republic of Conor Lamb was re-elected, who won a seat in the second division in the previous spring in exceptional elections.
The Lamb's alternate candidate is Keith Rothfus, who is currently representing the previous division of Pennsylvania, 12th, which in large parts overlaps with the new division 17.
The maps were changed following the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January, which led to the division of the old districts into a Constitutional Electoral region, favouring the Republican.
The 17th elections have triggered a campaign in which money is used over the major political divisions - the Democratic Convention Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republics campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became known as the Pennsylvania after a narrow victory many viewed in March at the extraordinary elections in the 18th district of Pennsylvania.
In this regard, the Republic has been the winner of the six decades and President Donald Trump won the division by 20 points.
Political protesters have given the Democrats little advantage.
The US El Salvador was punished for supporting China, then retreated.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, which was a small setback in Washington.
In a friendly climate, Mr Trump met with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners threw out the management team of the Trump company.
Foreign Ministry officials decided to recall the American leaders of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, as the Minister of Press, Heather Nauert, said earlier this month that these countries did not support Taiwan recently.
However, it was only planned to punish El Salvador, who received USD 14 million in aid from the United States of America in 2017, including for drug monitoring, development and economic motivation.
The proposed sanctions for reducing financial assistance and imposing visa restrictions would have been painful for the Central American state and its high unemployment and the number of killings.
During home meetings, North America and Central America officials held a high-level meeting aimed at security and prosperity in order to hold a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a development in their efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
In the middle of September, the high officials explained that they wanted to continue the consultation and to discuss any El Salvadori penalties.
According to the diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pence will now be evaluated, who will speak at the meeting in mid-October to talk about government positions.
And three American ambassadors secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The President of the White House, Mr Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the three American officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss national debates on requests for an anonymous stay.
These discussions were confirmed by a close analysis of the government, which also spoke on request for anonymity.
Story of study
Next, it could happen that Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller will report on the possible justice of Trump, for which there is a lot of evidence in the archives of the state.
Mueller is also allegedly investigating in his study whether the Trump campaign is linked to the Russian attack in our elections.
If Congress were to change the party, Trump would have to report in this institution as if he were going to go back and talk to the voters and perhaps even his senior judge.
There are a lot of demises here, and I don't want to point out that it is necessary to ensure that Mr. Trump or his European counterparts are guaranteed.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that affects the duration of the struggle.

History passes around these turning points and democracy's ruthless marches near or delaying.
The Americans are now facing a number of turning points.
What are we going to do if the Ministry fires Rod Rosenstein, Deputy Prosecutor of the D.A., the man who controls the outcome of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since he was informed that he made a request for the President's secret storage last year and he speculating on that position's inconclusiveness.
Rosenstein says that The Times' statement is inaccurate.
“How can you react if the investigation of Brett Kavanaugh, the newly requested FBI party, is not complete and complete, or if he or she is confirmed to the Court of Justice in spite of serious accusations about sexual assault and false statements?
And in particular, shall we vote in favour of the Congress in the middle elections if Trump is to be held accountable?
If these tests fail, democracy will take a long winter vacation.
But I don't think we're going to make it because we've learned from Prague.

The Rangers' Graham Dorrans is the Radid Viennese Battle's pre-optimism.
The Rangers will organize the Rapids in Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over Australia, which was followed earlier this month at the beginning of the month by an impressive link against the Villarreal in Spain, will put them in a strong position to become the Group of the European League G.
The knee injury did not allow the middle player Graham Dorrans to perform the first appearance of the season before 2nd : a game with 2 pins against the Rärreal, but believes that the Rangers can use this result as a leap to achieve better results.
“This was a good point for us, because Markreal is a strong opponent,” said the 31-year-old player.
“We went into the game, believing that we could accomplish something and left the game with a point.
Maybe we could have achieved more than that, but it was usually a fair result.
They were better at the first half of the game, and we at the second half of the game.
Tuesday will be another big and important European night.
I hope we get three points, but this will be a difficult game because they got a good result in their last game, but since they support us, I'm sure we can get together and get a good result.
Last year was hard, thanks to that, I was hurt, and there were changes in the club, but now we all feel good about ourselves.
The team is good and the boys will enjoy it; training is good.
I hope we can move on now, leave last season behind and be successful."
Women cannot sleep because of the risk of pension insurance.
Despite the fact that interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few discussed it with their family members.
Half the participants in the Nationalwide study said they were talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“The people want family members to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” explained Holly Snyder, Nationalwide Life Insurance Officer.
This should begin.
Talk to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family for care unless they know your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as these options may be of crucial importance in terms of costs.
Consult your financial adviser: Your adviser may have a good idea of how to pay for their expenses.
Your financing options in relation to long-term care may include, for example, a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a higher value for money in order to help cover these costs, or an asset self-insurance policy - as long as you have the necessary funds.
Prepare your own legal documents: Stop all possible legal battles already at an age.
Be concerned about the Health Services Act to determine the trustee who will monitor your medical care and ensure that professionals will follow your wishes at a time when you cannot communicate.
Also consider the individual in relation to his or her own financial resources.
Choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid even if you are ineffective.
Forget the little details: Imagine that your old mother has a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit by the Palu of Indonesia on Friday by officials adding that the number of deaths is still increasing.
Since the communication is lost, the rescuers have not received any information from the Donggala Regent north of Pau, which remains close to the event centre of the 7th Magnificent earthquake.
More than 16 000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
The following are some of the most important facts about Paru and Donggala, on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the Province of Central Sulawes, located at the periphery on the west coast of the island of Sulawes, and the population there was estimated to be 379 800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was suddenly hit by an earthquake and a tsunami.
The Dongala regent is an area that extends over 300 km (twice) in the north-west of the island of Sulaea.
The code, which is an administrative area under the jurisdiction of the province, was estimated to have 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawes region, in particular the Donggala coastal region.
In the province, it is also important that nickel mining is concentrated mainly on Morowal, Sulasee’s opposite coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, during the last 100 years, tsunamis have hit Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed by the tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996 the tsunami struck the west of Donggala, killing nine.
Indonesia is seismic in the Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Next we will mention the most recent earthquake and tsunami in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh, Indonesia, on 26 December 2004 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226 000 people on the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In March and early April, several strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6,8-degree earthquake struck Indonesia's most inhabited southern part of the island of Java, creating a tsunami that hit the southern coast and hit nearly 700 people.
2009: The area near Padang, the capital city of the West Sumatra Province, was hit by an earthquake of 7,6 degrees.
There were more than 1 100 people killed.
2010: A 7,5-degree earthquake hit one of the Sumatran islands - the island of Mentawai, firing a tsunami up to 10 metres in height, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A deep earthquake struck the Regent of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, burning destruction and panic, reminding people of the deadly earthquake of 2004 and the destruction of the tsunami.
There was no tsunami at that time, but more than 100 people were killed in collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombard, killing more than 500 people, mainly north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily in the hands of a goat.
The oldest son of Palin was arrested in connection with domestic violence charges.
The oldest son of Track Palin, the former Governor of Alaska and the vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested in connection with the attack.
According to a report published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin (29) was arrested in Wasilla in the State of Alaska for suspicion of domestic violence, for intervention in the report on domestic violence and for the prosecution of opposition.
According to the police report, when a female person tried to inform the police about alleged crimes, Palin took a phone call from him.
The prize will be held at the Mat-Su Pre-Inquiry and held against a 500-dollar bail-out.
He appeared on Saturday in the court where he declared that he was ‘not guilty in any case’, reported the news network.
Palin is facing three A-value misdemeanors, which means that he can be expected to be in prison for up to a year and with a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a B-value misdemeanor that is punishable by one-day imprisonment and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a criminal offence.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Pal.
In connection with the alleged attack, her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police.
The case is currently being discussed in Alaska's Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic attack, domestic violence in intervention and possession of a weapon, all in a drunk state.
His girlfriend claimed that he hit him in the face.
The groups of veterans criticised Sarah Palin in 2016 when she was involved in the violent conduct of her son with PTSD, which is the result of her service in Iraq.
A tsunami followed by an earthquake in Indonesia: the dead are hundreds.
At least 384 people have been killed since the earthquake on the island of Sulages in Indonesia since Friday.
A 7th-degree earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks will not work and the number of deaths will be expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the suburbs of the city centre of Sulawes, which remained in the northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
In the social media, videos are broadcast showing the moment of an earthquake.
At the time of the tsunami, hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the shores of the town of Palu.
In NYC, federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attacks.
The New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saopov, suspected of a New York terrorist attack in which eight people were killed. This rare sentence has not been committed for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used the Home Depot rental car to attack the West Side road along the west Side road on Lower Manhattan, both pedestrians and cyclists on their way in October.
According to the report of the death penalty lodged in the New South, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and also caused serious injury on a deliberate basis in order to justify the death penalty.
In this case, the case is a possible death penalty on the basis of the case-file.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury filed 22-point charges against Saipov, which included eight counts of murder together with extortion, which are commonly used by the federal prosecutors in criminal offences, and charges of violence and the destruction of the engine.
The attack expected “serious planning and planning,” the prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s activities as “abominable, cruel and defamatory.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and damage to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleveland, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” in the intention statement.
The five victims were the Turks.
It's been ten years since the last murder case of the New South District District Court in New York.
The guilty Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but the end result was that he was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last executed in the federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of New York in 1953, when the couple were executed after the conviction in a conspiracy for spying on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a local usbeck, showed that, according to the case file, there was a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack.
He said he had told the investigators that he was pleased with what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack to commit the ISIS videos viewed from his phone.
He said that he also wanted ISIS flags to be displayed in his hospital hall.
In a 22-point charge, his faults have not been accepted by him.
David Patton, a national defender of Saipov, said that they were “much disappointed in the decision of procedure.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty will result in a prolonged trauma for all concerned,” said Patton.
Prior to that, the Saipov Defence Team asked the prosecutors not to request the death penalty.
Mr Tory said that NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to the Head of the Brext negotiations.
During the protest of the Tory Conference today, Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize the People’s Army during the protest. ”
The former UK President said that the politicians had to “be familiar with the heat ” of the Eurosceptics, because one of the members of Theresa May suggested to lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Birmingham, the Conservative Tight Peter Bone, said that the UK “will be out by now” if Mr Farage was the Secretary of the Brixite.
However, Mrs May is faced with the problem of advocating her deeply divided lines, which were emphasised by the Conservatives in favour of staying, joining the city's protest against Brixit.
The Prime Minister is in need of keeping his Chequers on track in the middle of the attacks on the Brixt supporters, the ice-creamers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that he continue the transaction with Brussels despite the opposition and that the Eurosceptics and Liberals choose between their package and "cassation".
Bone said at the meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihu that he wanted to give up "Chequers' plan".
He suggested taking Farage as a partner and giving him responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
'In his responsibility, we'd be out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough's Member added: "I stand up for Brex, but we have to give up Chequers' plan."
In the face of his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not been in World Wars in order to be subject to world wars.
We want to create our own laws on our own land."
Mr Bone rejected the recommendations that the public opinion has now changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wish to remain is not true."
The supporter of Tory Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told the reporters: “One more thing: Prime Minister, listen to people.
“The Chequers plan is generally unpopular, the opposition does not vote in favour, it is unpopular in our political parties and among our activists who actually go across the streets and choose us at all.
Please leave the Chequers pattern and start listening."
He added to Maya’s address: “Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.”
Farage said that the politicians present at the meeting must be made "to know the heat" if they intend to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"This is now the issue of trust between us – the people – and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell you that "we won't let this happen."
In the war he added to an enthusiastic audience: “I want you to put in our political class, which is on the brink of treason at Brechite, to be uncomfortable.
“We will mobilise the nation army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit, and we will not rest until we have achieved our own, local, local, UK”.
At the same time, the icers marched through Birmingham before a two-hour gathering was held in the centre of the city.
A bunch of activists waved the stories of "Toors Against Brexit" after the group was set up this weekend.
The Lord Adonis of the Liberals mocked the Conservatives for their security issues that took place at the opening of the session of these political parties.
“These are the people who say that IT systems can take Canada and all the technology to Canada, and even more so, for a smooth border crossing, for cross-border trade in Ireland without restrictions,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
Like a good Brex, there is no such thing as a good Brex," he added.

Russian Grand Prix: ← Hamilton approaches the World Championship after a team survey gave him victory over the Sebastian Vettle.
From now on, it turns out that Valtter Bottas' qualification in front of Mr Hamilton on Saturday is that the order of the Mercedes team plays a major role in the race.
Bottas got to a good start and left Hamilton almost in disrepute when he, on the first two occasions, defended his position and invited Vett to attack his teammate.
The toilet first went to the box stop and left the Hamilton branch behind in a busy traffic which should have been decisive.
Mercedes went to the boxing stop a circle later and came out after Vült, but Hamilton went to lead after being side by side when the Ferrari's leader left the inside of the house to be released after the third corner tried to protect it with a double move.
Max Verstappen started the competition from the rear row of the grid and was ranked number one at the end of the first round for his 21st birthday.
He then led the competition recently, driving the rubbers to the finish and passed Kimi Räikkönen, taking second place.
He finally drove to the box stop on 44th round, but he failed to increase the speed of the last eight rounds, which gave Räikkönen the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtter's been doing a lot of good work all week, and he was a real gentleman who missed me.
“The team has done a great job to have one of two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump said at the gathering of Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday that he had not leaked a letter from Mr. Blasy Ford, who accused the Supreme Court's notary of sexual harassment of Brett Kavanaugh.
When speaking at the meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Legal Committee, but instead he commented on what was happening in the Senate, which indicates that people are “serious, disgusting and false. ”
“The only thing that can happen and what is happening in the Senate in a couple of days is that you see anger and anger, wicked people, fools and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at press releases and leaks that say: ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember his answer to the question “Did you leak the document? ” — “Ah, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak," he added with the Senator's face.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July on the charges against Kavanaugh, and it was leaked at the beginning of September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his work.
The report stated: “I did not hide the charge of Dr. Ford and leaked his story, ” said Feinstein to the Committee.
"He's asking me to keep a close eye on him, and I did it according to his request."
However, his refusal was not appropriate to the president who commented at the time of the Saturday assembly: “You know what, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but it's one of the worst body languages I've ever seen."
By continuing to protect the Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would use these charges for their own benefit.
“They have decided to take back power without selecting the resources.
You see this meanness and insolentness, it doesn't matter who they hurt, who they need to cross over to gain power and control," said the President of the Media.

Gianci Patrick Dwyer created two gates against Dundee.
Dundee Stars won a Friday night's elite re-election at Belfast Giants, who lost Dundele 5 : 3.

Dwyer's opening gate came at 4:35 a.m. with Kendall McFall and David Rutherford's help when Beauvillier doubled out four minutes later.
In the hurry of the home team in the first quarter of 13:10, Sullivan brought back the time before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie hit the fig gate at 15-16 minutes.
Dwyer assured Giants that he would lead the first break first, beating his second gate at the end of the first three nights.

Tunisia airport: According to Air Niugin, one man has disappeared since the flight accident in the lagoon.
Although it was said earlier that all 47 passengers and crews had been safely evacuated from a floating aircraft, the air carrier now claims that he was operating a plane that crashed the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia and that one man was missing.
Air Niugini said in his statement that, since Saturday afternoon, they could not find a single male passenger.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the passenger’s details, such as his age and nationality questions.
Domestic ships helped save other passengers and crews after the plane crashed to Chuuki airport on landing at the airport of Chuuki.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but their condition was stable.
The circumstances of the accident and the chain of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said that the aircraft landed far from the flight path.
The Witness thought that the aircraft had crossed the airway.
American passenger Bill Jayes said that the plane was flying very low on the landings.
“This is very good,” said Jayes.
Jayes said that he and other passengers were able to reach an emergency exit in the high water of their belts on a floating plane.
He mentioned that the cabin crew was panicky and screaming and that he had a small head trauma.
The U.S. Navy and the sailors who worked on a nearby well also helped rescue the use of inflatable boats to bring people to the shores before the plane sank about 30 metres [30 m] into the water.
Air Safety Network data show that 111 persons have died in air accidents involving air carriers registered with PNG in the last two years, but none of them were related to Air Niugin.
The analyst shall draw up a schedule for the evening when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution closed the case on a Saturday for a review of a man accused of burning a wife from Mississippi in 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlet of the United States Justice Department of the United States of America spent several hours analysing intelligence data as an expert.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to re-establish the 29-year-old complaint against Quinton Tellis's and 19-year-old victim, Darlem Chambers' movements on the night she died.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to the earlier claims of the young man.
When the data showed that he had been with Chambers, the young man himself had claimed that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, which is why the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford stepped into the courthouse on Saturday and admitted that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked him if Tellis had told the truth when he said that he had been in the Sanford car, Sanford said that Tellis "was lying because my car was in Nashville".
Another ambiguity was that Tellis said she had known Chambers before she died about two weeks before she died.
The phone records showed that the women had known each other only for a week.
Rowlett claimed that shortly after Chambers died, Telli deleted messages, calls and communications from her phone from Chambers.
“She deleted a girl from her life,” Hale said.
The defense is about to have its trial done on Sunday.
The judge said that he thought the case would go to the jury in the next half of the same day.

New York babysitting is suing the racist message after a couple of courts.
The New York baby-sitter is suing the court for discriminating a couple of times after family accidentally receiving a message, where the mother complained that the baby-sitter was “an additional black man”.
A couple deny that they are racists, compared to blackmailing the situation.
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed his resentment when she found out that their new pediatric care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first came to work in 2016.
Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband a message saying, "NOTIII III, THE NORTHERN MUSTAINERS."
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice twice.
According to New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman, who was uncomfortable after his prognostic understanding of Miss Maurice, claimed that their social nanny, who was an African-American, had done bad work and had waited for her instead for him to be a Philistine.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day and then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple to obtain the compensation she wants to obtain on a daily basis for the amount of $350 per day for the next six months, and the same work that she was originally hired to do without a contract.
"I want to show you that, so let's do it," he said to the newspaper The Post, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
A couple have rejected the argument that they are racists, saying that it was a reasonable thing to stop working with Maurice because they feared that after insulting her, they could no longer trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
He's not a racist.
“We are not racists,” said the wife’s wife’s wife, Joel Plasco, to the newspaper The Post.
“But would you allow your children to be kept by the person you have been rude, even if it was involuntary?
Is it a newborn?
Come on.
Commenting on the comparison of blackmail, Plasco said that his wife was two months from the birth of a child and was “in a very difficult situation”.
Would you go against someone like that?
That's not very nice of you right now," investment banker.
Although the case is still under way, the public opinion has been quick to judge in social media where they are seriously judged by their behaviour and thinking.
The letter states that Paddington publishers feared that readers would not communicate with the talking bear.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born right after the book was adopted, said: “It is hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who read it for the first time before the publication.
It is very fun to know now what we know about the great success of Paddington."
He said that his father, being inspired to write a children's book about a small shell, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, would have been optimistic about his rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book was the death of his father with a nuisance shadow last year.
He added about Paddington, whom he described as “a very important member of our family”, that he added that his father was silently proud of his final success.
“He was quite a silent man and was not an admirable man,” he said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was how it felt when your child achieved something: you are proud of them, even though it is not directly your achievement.
I believe he looked at Paddington's success in this way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always acknowledged Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone on the way.
On land, her daughter was taken to the Nice Hospital in Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“They regularly called to say that the condition of the daughter was very bad and that I do not believe that she would survive, ” said Mrs Ednan-Laperous.
“Then I received a call from Nad, who said that my daughter would die in two minutes, and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll see you soon.
Soon I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave him to push his heart forward had begun to disappear quietly and to leave his body.
He was a little bit out of his mind before this, and now all the systems started to stop working.
All I had to do was sit there and wait, knowing what would happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation where families and people lived.
I had to stick together."
She left with Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who now mourned her daughter, on a plane with other passengers who knew nothing about her experiences.
"No one knew this," he said.
“I kept my head down and the tears flowed all this time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt a terrible outbreak of compassion on this flight against Nadi.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved him."

Missie's son was 13 when she suffered from depression, and 18 when she killed herself.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
A 45-year-old Ms. Lydney said that her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“All knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile would light the whole room."

In 2014, a brother who was 11 years old, found his brother after he had taken his own life.
Pr Davis said: "I worry constantly that it has a domino effect."
She created these maps “to let people know that there are people to turn to and talk to, even with her friend.
Don't shut up - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphrey, who has been a friend with Miss for many years, lost Mark, a partner with her 15-year-old together, not long after her mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt bad or was depressed or anything, ” he said.
“We noticed a change in his behavior a few days before Christmas.
He was at his lowest point on the first Sunday – when the children opened their gifts, he had no eye or eye on them."
Ms. Humphreys said that the death of a man was a terrible trauma for them, but they have to deal with it: “It will tear the wound into the whole family.
It's gonna tear us apart.
We have to keep going and keep fighting."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs on top of his hair, while Brett Kavanaugh’s investigation begins.
“I thought that if we could actually get something that he wanted — a short period of time and scope of research — we could perhaps achieve unity,” said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the Committee would “fall together” in the midst of a persistent blockage of partisans.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to look into it?
Their opposition was the result of a period of time.
The election is only after five weeks, 6 November. If the Republicans do not act as well as they do, they are likely to be weakened in their intentions to get the unintended man to the top court in the world.
George W. Bush has taken over the phone to call the senators, working hard to support Mr Kávanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.

The number of North Pacific military fighters under the "cancell" under the Kim government of Kim is the same as the number of "cancellable".
South Korea's legislation has said that the number of North Korea military runners in South Korea has shifted since Kim Jong-un came into power seven years ago.
Byeong-Seugree, referring to data from the Ministry of Integration of South Korea, said that compared to 2011 military troops (2706), their number has fallen last year (1127).
Mr. Park said that the main factors are stronger border controls between North Korea and China and more human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
South Korea's citizenship has been offered to a large number of North-Westernjoics.
According to Seoul magazine, there are more than 30 000 North Koreans from the end of the war since the end of the war to reach a legally cross-border in 1953.
Most people escape through a walrus that has the longest national border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than a highly protected, demilitary area between the two.
China takes military action as illegal immigrants rather than as refugees and often sends them back to their homelands with force.
North and South Africa's relations, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the heads of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the abolition of nuclear weapons that stopped them.
This happened after the historic meeting held in June between US President Donald Sõmp and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general to work towards the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
At this time, however, North Korea-ho, Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of sanctions due to the lack of progress.
“In no way do the United States of America, there is no security in our country, and in these circumstances, we do not agree in any way to make ourselves the first unilaterally armed,” said Mr. Ri in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
69 The fear called Brett Kavanaugh "hypty" and said that the man was unfit for the Supreme Court.
The opposition director of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelos, called Brett Kavanaugh, the judge of the Supreme Court, “sympathetic” and said that the man was presumptuously unfit to work as the judge of the Supreme Court.
There was a fear of giving an opinion on this Saturday's interview at the Court of Justice of Texas Tribune.
“I noticed without a doubt that if a woman had made such a difference, she would have been called hysterical,” said Fear about her reaction to the testimony given to the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday of Kavanaugh’s Senate Legal Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Blasy Ford, both of whom were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening statement, describing his family and high school years, he almost screamed at times and was at times silent.
He also explicitly welcomed the members of the Democratic Party in the Committee, appointing the accusations against him of the loss of the Presidential elections in Hillary Clinton in 2016 as the “grotess and coordinated hit” of the organisation of angry Liberals.
According to fear, he believes that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that a man is not fit as the Supreme Court's judge because it shows that he is bent against the Democrats.
“The idea that he disqualifies himself with these protests and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats, ” he said.
The fear remained modest when asked if he would attempt to withdraw him from office if he was confirmed by Kavanaugh if the Democrats were to get a majority at the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you so much – if he doesn’t tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he’ll not only be the judge of the Supreme Court, but he won’t fit into the court where he works now,” said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently the judge of the Court of Appeal of the Columbia District.
He added that as a democrat, he was concerned about any decisions against the Affordable Care Act (Professor’s Act) or Roe v. Wade (Legal Judge — Translation of an Abortor) as a man is considered to be a conservative judge.
At its meeting, Mr Kavanaugh called on questions as to whether or not he would withdraw any of the Supreme Court rulings.
“Now is not the time when a hysterical tilted person could become a presenter and expect us to say, ‘ Isn’t this a great time,’ said Pelosi.
Women and women have to wear it.
It's a fair speech, a six- and a half-year-old hatred, and he can't cry about it.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, does it?
He went on to say: “I got help from a woman who was on the chair; she said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a method that involved that, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was saying, “You might think I’m crying, because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partly considered as an expression of rage because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my brightest memories is one of the early jobs of men in a large office where I once found myself crying with unspeakable rage when one older woman — the leader I had always feared — grabbed me from the collar and dragged me into the stairwell.
“ Never tell them to cry, ” he told me.
“They don’t know you’re mad at you.
They think you're sad and it'll satisfy them."
Patricia Schiroeder, a former Democratic Party Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart for the presidential election campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart missed an extramarital love story on board a yacht named Monkey Business and ended the campaign, the deeply irritated Schroeder thought that there was no reason why he should not think about running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-advised decision,” he told me 30 years later after he called me.
“There were seven candidates already, and all they needed was someone else to join.”
Someone says it's like "The Snow White and the Thumb Thumb Boy."
As the campaign was about to end, he was late in collecting money, and he promised not to run if he couldn't make a total of $2 million.
It was a hopeless battle.
He discovered that some of his supporters, who donated men $1,000, gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he thought.
When he made a speech in which he announced that he would not launch an official campaign, he felt — gratitude to the people who supported him — an irritability for the system that made it difficult for him to collect money and turn to the voters instead of to turn to the voters, and hatred for sex — he must be overcome by tears in his throat.
“You would have thought that I had a nervous breakdown,” Mr Schroeder reminded the press of the reaction against him.
“You could have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor company.
I remember thinking about what they're writing on my gravestone.
"He cried?"
How can the US-China trade war be useful for Beijing?
The liberalisations of the trade war between the USA and China were regrettable and, although the conflict is far from over, the experts say that the interstate gap can be useful in the long term for Beijing.
This year, President Donald Trump of the United States of America made the first warning shot by imposing taxes on important Chinese goods, including on panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation took place this week with new tariffs of USD 200 billion (EUR 150 billion) for goods, essentially imposing taxes on half of the goods arriving in the USA from China.
The prices have responded to the same thing at any time, setting the last five to ten per cent tariffs at 60 billion dollars in value to American goods.
The Land has promised the US a shot to answer, and the second largest economy in the world will probably not be blinked soon.
Getting Washington to retreat would mean giving in to demands, but publicly worshiping the United States would be too embarrassing for President Xi Jinping of the PRC.
However, the experts argue that if the Beijing Cards are out correctly, a trade war with the United States can support China in the long term, reducing the interrelationship between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that will lead to the abolition of economic control in another country is, in fact, much more dangerous than the viewers have previously admitted,” said Abigal Grace, a researcher who focuses on investigating Asia at the Center for New American Security.
According to the Foreign Minister, Syria is ready to return to refugees.
According to Syria, the state is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and requests with the help of more than seven years after the war to rebuild the country.
When speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem said that the situation was improving in the country.
“The situation is now more stable and secure on national territory thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government will continue to restore normality to the restoration of a region destroyed by terrorists.
There is now every condition that refugees who have left the country because of unilateral economic measures that have affected terrorism and everyday life and living are able to voluntarily return to the country.
According to the preliminary estimates, 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need emergency aid.
Al-Moulem said that the Syrian regime would be happy to accept aid for the construction of a country that has been destroyed.
He also stressed that the State did not accept any aid or aid from States that supported the resurrection.
In Europe, in Paris, the Ryder Cup Competition was won by the Ryder Cup Competition in Paris.

The 8th Ryder Cup veteran, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the 25,5-point winner of the race, the most winning European ever.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop myself today.
It's been a long time.

It is a matter of team spirit, and I am glad to have been able to help," said emotionally, after the victory of Europe in Garcia.
He will pass the tortoise on to the contemporary Jon Rahm, who won the U.S. >>eng<< Woods 2 & 1 .
“I am particularly proud that I won Tiger Woods – I grew up looking up,” said Rahm, 23 years old.
The Woods lost all their four matches in France, and now he has a career in Ryder's cup competitions 13 : 21 : 3.
A strange statistics for one of the best players of all time who have won 14 Grand Competition titles, leaving only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team was out all weekend looking for the fairways, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Ny Finau, who played high-level golf all weekend.
The U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his disappointment at the team: “I’m proud of guys, they were hysterical.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europeans.
We fought them.
A hat in front of the horn.
He's a great guy.
All of his 12 warriors did a good job.
Let's get together, work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 types, and I'm proud to be their captain.
A hat to lift a hat.
"We were better played."
