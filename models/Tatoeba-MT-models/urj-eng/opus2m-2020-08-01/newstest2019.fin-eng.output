Emil Kouki led Hurricane to the opening of his home victory - Savo Volley's second victory for Savo Volley.
On the other hand, seven consecutive rounds of the men's volleyball Championship League were started by Hurricane Loima at home in 2018-19 when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was 22 points to Hurricane's most effective player.
There were some exorcisms, but they didn't come true, and then there was a call from Loamaa.
Soon we got a deal, Kouki said.
The Tomi Rumpunen supported Kouk at 18 points by Tomi Rumpunen, who played in Loimu, as well as in Loimu.
The most effective guest was by comparison the playful national team player Samuli Kaislasalo at 17 points.
It is always important to win the key game.
Many players had experience with their opponents, and it brought extra extra extra experience in the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but it is, of course, the goal to extend the medal pipe, Kouki said.
This is the most powerful of Savo Olley's power.
Miro Määnen was 18 points at Savo Volley's most powerful when the team knocked down next to Vantaa Ducks 3-0.
The game was sneezing, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately, we were able to win the victory.
At least I didn't have any knowledge of any different kind of download when I played against my former team, Mänän said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career during the period 2000-2001, did 12 points at the next Aerospace in the 3 series.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with a number of points.
The hall was a small or unsightly mood all the time.
The good girl stayed at the home opening.
Miro was a king, and the Attic played a good game, too, Importer said.
The safe last season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielavede Sammo as Tõvinen's head coach, even then.
Thiago Maciel was Ducks' most effective 14 points.
Mikkon again the star of the Aka-Voleto.
Joni Mikkonen, the winner of the 2012-13 league point exchange, has also made a strong start for this period.
Hakkuri scored 25 points when Aka-Volly took the opening win of the season after he fell Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season has started from its very own point of view.
Of course it was close today, because we were the fourth to lose at 17-21.
There was a tip on a batch, and the fifth round was right there, Mikkonen said.
A few years ago, the most effective tigers in the finals was the 28-point hacker Edwardts Buitids.
Earthman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported by 17 points.
We didn't get much of a shot at the guy's hack, Mikkonen complimented us.
In comparison with human beings, the world's number one, compared to human beings, is the world's number one.
Finland is at the top of the world's approach to human power, reports Lancet.
The survey compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared with 195 countries.
In both years Finland was one of the statistics.
In 2016, the weekend was equal to 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was one higher, and the list instead of Canada was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst comparison was made between Niger and South Sudan.
In measuring human capital, the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population is examined.
The World Bank has focused its human capital on economic growth.
The Thibaut Courtois of Real Madrid kept Atletto under control, the game ended with no paint.
The goalkeeper of Real Madrid, Thibaut Courtois, pulled to the great farce, and the game of the Madridian teams ended at the end of the goalless game late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
From Atletico Madrid, Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but the Belgian watchman was looking for a fight.
Courtois played three games in Atletico through the mortgage nest while he was a Chelsea player.
At the beginning of the week, the Fifa of the U.S. Führer chose him as the goalkeeper for the year.
At Real, the best destination was Gareth Bale, but his shots passed at the end of the finish line of the goal.
Bale missed a break after the exchange due to a travel injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real's supporters called for the name of Cristiano Ronaldo, a paintr who moved to Juvey.
The public is now being attacked against the right of abortion - A powerful document tells us why why.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out if one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could choose the candidate named by President Donald Trump Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive vote of Kavanaugh could be reversed by a decision known as Roe v Wade, which took an abortion law in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary Converting Roe - United States and the right to abortion tell us how the current situation has changed over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is also relevant in Finland.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Soini (sin) has carried out publicity work against a safe abortion and received various levels of support from the majority of the MPs in our country.
At the beginning of the powerful document, gynecologist Colleen McNicolas, who has been left as the only doctor for abortions in the state of Missouri due to legal blackmail, has been left as a doctor in the state of Missouri.
A clinical armed guard claims to defend U.S. freedom of religion.
News feeds remind me of fatal terrorist attacks at clinics.
Move to the time when the abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Association of Churchers of the Lutheran Church invited women to visit reliable abortion doctors.
The arguments of the pastor interviewed are good, but in fact they do not even need to be taken, a photograph of the dead woman who had had an abortion herself is enough.
The deaths in the United States were about 5,000 per year.
The legalisation of abortions was defended by the Republican Party in particular.
As early as 1967 in California, Governor Ronald Reagan signed the Athletic Law.
Later, in particular, Reagan, in his presidential campaign in 1980, began to invert religion against political voters.
His abortions were also carried out by his successor, George Bush's parent.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document reaches the deepest core of the issue in the search for the underlying cause of abortion policy.
When tax exemption was denied from the religious organizations that supported the racial comparison, they became politically active.
An abortion was selected for the rest of the week.
Religion has brought unusual ties to politics.
In writing this, in the United States, there is a situation where the President has chosen the Supreme Court as candidate for Kavanaugh, who is now accused of sexual harassment by a number of women.
Kavanaugh may be given the power to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and women.
The army of Israel shot three Palestinians, including two children, at the border with the great protests.
Almost 200 Palestinians have been killed in half a year after Israel has come to protestors in the border zone.
On Friday, the soldiers shot three Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, there are two children among the dead: 12 and 14-year-olds.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been injured.
Of these, 89 were wounded by bullets.
The army of Israel has confirmed that it opened fire and struck an air strike in the border zone when protestors threw Israel's troops with stones and explosives.
The army says that it has started using force, that protestors do not break down the border fence or try to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza’s demonstrations since March, when the Palestinians started weekly demonstrations at the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Council, 12,000 are wounded.
In 1948, the Palestinian families were required to have access to the areas where the Palestinians had to leave when the State of Israel was established.
A fire sniper has killed one of the Israeli soldiers.
Explosives from the Palestinians and helium spheres have triggered forest areas and agricultural land in Israel.
Teemu Santa bought a penalty kick - he couldn't shoot himself.
With Wigan's partner, Chey Dunkley seemed to have knocked him down with a back-to-back hit in the penalty zone.
Judge Gavin Ward gave the game over and over.
It is understood that the claim was clear.
The theme Santa could not believe his face.
I think the situation was a matter of concern for Judge Wardi, who sentenced Norwich to 85 minutes when Santa was put down.
Ward was looking at a penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic was shaking the 1-0 win.
Santa has made Norwich five paints in the Championships.
The first was born last Saturday against the QPR in an elegant way with the chest muscle.
The job was good for Puk again.
After losing the fire, he went on to finish the situation.
He created goals and defended tirelessly.
For Norwich, the match was the fifth in two weeks.
The team will continue in league.
There are five victory tubes in the back.
The help of the paediatric patients was immediately filled with reservations - some 40,000 people in Finland experience an interest in children.
It is estimated that two per cent of men and a large percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in my audiences.
This means approximately 40,000 people in Finland.
So far, it has been difficult for children or young people who are sexually interested in children and adolescents to get help.
The joint SeriE project between the Criminal Service Support Foundation and Sexpo will train professionals to meet pedophiles as clients and help people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, an e-mail flood began at Sexpo, providing advice and therapy, and meetings were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are promised to be released in the autumn.
The sexual preference for children causes many people to be ashamed.
The majority of pedophile feelings perceptive about themselves have not done their fantasy and therefore did not commit any criminal activity.
However, the opinion is generally a lasting quality.
Most of them hope to get rid of those thoughts that upset and paralyse them.
They also trouble the normal life, tells the Yle Yle about the sexual therapist, Patricia Thesleff, who is a specialist in the project.
In my opinion, work is valuable if any child is spared from the sexual violence, says Thesleff.
Chore leaders or Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize, the idea may seem strange, but Trump is one of the most popular prize winners on the basis of bet coefficients.
The background is the role of Trump in reaching North Korea, at least at the level of speech, to commit to nuclear separation.
The main favorites of the people who receive Nobel are the South Korean President Moon Jae and the North Korean leader Kim Jong, who have already met three times this year and promised to reach a peace agreement between their countries.
Warming between the corals is significant, since last year's between them was coal.
For years after that, the reward of Kim, which led to the nuclear weapons being threatened and to land by iron hand, would, indeed, also call for criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday and Friday will be the most attentionable, i.e. the peace prize.
If the award is not awarded to those taking part in the Korean peninsula diploma, one of the top-class Congolese physicians, Denis Mukwege, is one of the leading Congolese physicians.
Assessed gynecologists in their hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo have treated thousands of women who are victims of mass rape and have become the world's leading expert in their field.
Mukwege has paid attention to sexual violence, which is a creepy by-product of many conflicts.
A strong candidate has also been considered the United Nations Organisation for Refugees, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981.
The Nobel Committee has explained that this year the winner of the prize will receive 331 candidates.
The names of candidates shall not be disclosed to the public.
It wouldn't hurt itself if Nobel would.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say that, Trump said smiling.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued to refer to North Korea negotiations.
However, there are facts that make Tõmpi's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on this award, has often given recognition to persons and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multi-faceted world order - precisely the kind of cooperation that Trump has seen as its opponent.
In the 21st century, the award has been awarded to three US politicians, all of whom have been Democrats: Mr. Mari in 2002, Mr. Al Gore in 2007 and Mr. Barack Obama in 2009.
The award of a prize thus required the Nobel Committee to make an ideological translation of the entire translation.
Fire report in the tunnel: Car drivers were acting like bells and driving in the wrong direction.
The traffic chaos on the Lohja unit occurred on 8 September.
The traffic in the tunnel area was carried out as a result of the notification, both in the direction of Turku and in the direction of Helsinki.
When it became clear that this was a systematic problem, the fire service would try to bring the traffic to normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Centre said it can't be opened because there are car drivers in the road, they're blind and they're driving how it happens, Chief Burner Pasi Käräinen told STT at that time.
The highway was then started driving even in the wrong direction just a moment after waiting.
When the first one starts to act against traffic rules, some others often follow after them, the head of transport contact Tapio Heiskanen amazes.
According to the Transport Code, roads and tunnels must not arrive unless there is an overriding reason.
The safety of transport reminds us that in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to leave to alert traffic by emergency solutions.
The emergency vehicles shall always provide the most accessible operation possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and revoking.
The same prohibitions apply also in tunnels where the headlamps must always be switched on.
It is prohibited, as of course, to stop the car without a compelling reason, as is the case with parking.
There have even been cases in which the driver has stopped to the tunnel to brush the snow of his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and the time for this operation, Heiskanen says in the Road Safety bulletin.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration even though the ship was caught on the lake bottom.
The Ilves fans carrying the inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere would have wanted to remain on the ship to continue their victory party, even if the ship had been caught in the lakebed, reports Juho Syrja, who was the master of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on the way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, ran off its route late on Saturday night and was caught up in the old water in Aka.
19 passengers and five crew members on board the ship were evacuated at night to the mainland.
No one was hurt in the back of the car.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their party in the ship until morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them to the port and bus home to the firehouse, Syrja said to the STT.
Ilves fans were in Hämeenlinna following Ilves and HPK’s match, which ended in Ilves’s 4th victory.
The misguided friend of Saturday's was due to the fact that the water surface in Vanjavea was about half a mile lower than normal.
The fact that the nearest bus sign was covered by log bridges also made navigation more difficult, which is why its reflectors were not normally visible in the dark autumn bridge.
No more significant collisions.
The guy happened to be in the south of the narrow Jumussalmi shortly after the ship's route had crossed the motorways between Tampere and Helsinki.
The case was not associated with a larger drama, as the speed of the vessel was very low at the time of the event and the impact of the hit on the ground did not result in a more significant incident.
Misguided failure has not caused ship leaks or weights, and the cruises of the ship are normal in view.
The diver visited the ship on Saturday morning to check the quality of the ship before the ship began to tow off the low tide.
We're still going to the yard to check that this didn't cause any damage, Syrja says.
The indirect believes that the next tour of M/Suen, which is closed next weekend, can be handled as an amicable one.
The cruise season of the ship will end, according to him, until the day of independence.
There is no use for aiding.
The rescue facility received an alarm from the incident on Saturday night just after 12 noon.
The port of Visa was called upon to receive emergency passengers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
In the late evening, the day-old fireman Matti Willman told me that the evacuation conditions in the lake were difficult because of the darkness and rather severe wind.
After six to three o’clock on the night of Sunday, the civil protection service informed that everyone on board the ship had been evacuated and that passengers had been transferred to Tampere by bus and coach.
A cruiser built in 1957 has been formerly built in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
A final candidate for the High Representative who is accused of harassment and drinking may miss a high-level post.
Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court Judge, may well miss the post he is pursuing, and the Executive Director, Mika Vella, will evaluate the Institute for Foreign Affairs.
Up to now, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour during their studies.
According to Aalto, the doubts have brought so much pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up recruiting someone else.
In the United States, it has happened at times in the past that the President's election to the Supreme Court has caused a great deal of conflict.
In general, the Judge-Rapporteur himself has been drawn, reports Vázla.
This is what the president has been able to maintain his face.
A name for a hundred democratic camps.
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but even in the case of Kavanaugh, the election of a new judge has become a politically very sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, the decision to rain will, according to Aalto, probably be in the Democrat camp in the forthcoming elections of the Congress.
It would call for vote in favour of young people and women who would most likely vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, the title of a conservative judge in the Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republics.
An appeal is not addressed to any of the presidential term, for in the United States the Supreme Court judges are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have left their own retirement at about 70-80 years of age.
Some of the Republics also hesitate to name names.
The United States Supreme Court will normally be subject to a statement of evidence, says Vella.
Although Trump has only given the FBI an additional investigation within a period of one week, it may still reveal something relevant.
Yes, it can.
There is rarely smoke without fire, says Silla.
It is certain, at least, that the appropriateness or impossibility of Kavanaugh's office will continue to be actively debated before the Senate takes its decisions.
The Republics have a majority in the Senate, 51 to 49 votes, but no doubt the name of Kavanaugh, who is believed to be a two-sided Republicanist, is to be considered by the Republican Republican Republican Republican Republican.
The most embarrassing thing would be that the name would be cast to the vote and the Republicans would lose.
A woman identified Salisbury as a military intelligence agent for a suspect in military intelligence.
The Russian woman has informed the BBC that she has identified Salisbury as an agent for the military intelligence services of the warlord Russia, who is suspected of poisoning.
Based on the photographs, the woman reported that this was military intelligence with Anatoli Tshepiga, a member of the GRU.
Net Community Belgium and the Russian Insider Russia previously reported that they had exposed another of the men suspected of poisoning to Chepiga.
Previously, they said they had any evidence that men's current identities are covert personalities.
The group of BBC traveled to the Far East near the border of Russia and China to the village where the Shepiga grew up.
The woman in the village identified a young woman named Tshepigan Bellingcat in a picture published by Shepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man in the pictures of the British police officer, who represented Ruslan Boshiro as the man who now calls himself the Boshiro.
Russians are suspected of poisoning Sergei Skripal, a former co-agent, and his daughter with Novithhok’s nervous system in March.
The Scriples survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been awarded, among other things, at the honor of the Lord of Russia in 2014.
Russia is still denying the suspected GUU connection.
The men who suspected of being poisoned previously told the Russian TV interview in Salisbury in September as tourists.
Old people threw away in bags during the soviet reform.
A live example of what, in effect, the change of the regime defined by the Government of Sipilä means by virtue of the change in the nature of the change of the war reform has now been gained.
My region’s Vaala sote services are produced by the Oulänkaari County Union, whose health service director is the post-elected former regional director of Iljando in 2016.
The Heads of the Fleet warn the delegation of the suspension of the change.
If the war expenditures now rise, the municipality's state aid will be cut in the future.
The municipality’s central administrators were terrified, and most of them were ready for a major restructuring of the old age care system, which would end the health centre’s bedside care and a small unit for memory patients.
Further home care would be provided, which means long distances in Vaala means that the elderly living in the outlying villages should be treated with "home" next to the health centre.
He trusted that the municipality would pay its customers.
The left-wing panel of whales did not have a bad preparation, but organised a public event with many others, local nurses and also representatives of other parties.
I presented to you the sote county preparations on how the old people are being treated in Vaala, as well as in Northern Ostrobothnia, for the most part, at present in the home of the elderly.
Also included was the regional councillor Carina Läntinen.
The newspaper made a big story about the event, and it raised the Oulkankaari manufacturers back to their backs.
Sote manufacturers do not write on any paper that Atlando has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is currently waiting for empty residents.
There are no other service providers.
The rapporteurs are talking only about service receipts, but do not tell us what level of care it will receive or what type of staff structure Ilando will treat the elderly until escort treatment.
Air nurse?
The sites of the health centre will be terminated because there is no doctor’s resting session.
Ilando will also seek medical advice from doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the whale shows how central officials run authorised officials with incomplete information and the authorised officers are placed against the wall with a change limiter.
The Centre therefore clears the inhabitants of Valala, for who remains safe to live there on a voluntary basis if there is a chance to move out.
Was one of the central sayings that the whole country is considered to be inhabited?
President Erdogan, President of President Erdogan, opened a big-mosketeer in Cologne.
In the city of Cologne, Germany, thousands of people showed their minds when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who visited the country, opened the largest mosque in Europe.
Hundreds of people had been gathered by the Reinjoki River since spring.
Erdogan is not welcome, read on the sides of protestors, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During the visit to Erdogan on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held and the security measures have been tight.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Supporters of Erdogan had also been gathered in the surrounding area of the Great Moskey.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque's environment for safety reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan encouraged the success of his German visit and estimated that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdoga met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel swore on Friday that they would rebuild relations between countries, which have deteriorated significantly since then in the wake of the Turkish Revolutionary Company of 2016.
However, he stressed that there were deep differences between countries, including on human rights issues.
Review the visit.
Both the CEO-in-chief of Cologne and the Prime Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet withdrew their participation at the opening of the opening of the review of Erdogan’s visit.
A 30-year-old student from the market, Cansu, told me that he has come to a demonstration against Erdogan from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice to those who cannot go on the streets in the field.
They have been arrested, killed and subject to arrest.
For Erdogan, everything that is different from his own idea is terrorism.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is of Turkish origin in Erdogan’s last German trip to Germany.
In the triples, three accused of murdering a supplier.
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of supplier Jan Kuuk, too, who is responsible for the murder of supplier Jan Kuuk.
The D.A. told me on a Friday that three people are being accused of the bead murder of Kucak and this betrothed murder and other crimes.
Earlier this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kucs was found in February with his fiancé shot at his home in Bratislava.
He had studied relations between the politicians and the Italian mob.
The police have suspected the investigation of the murder-related Kucak Kucak.
The case and the article published in Kucia have taken care of media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of herds of cattle on Sundays in the sub-university area.
Due to the error of the printing, the Sunday Shepherd will also have to be posted as the addressless one.
This may appear in the distribution of the magazine in sub-installations where the distribution into the aggregates is carried out by external memory.
The situation was the same with regard to Saturday magazine, and the problem may still persist on Monday.
The post will send additional stamps to the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will be sent separately only on Monday, on a tabloid basis.
The distribution of these magazines is slow to delay.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
The editor, Arto Nyberg, will interview Vesa Heila, among other things, in his forthcoming discussion programme, directly today.
Vesa is in the studio telling about the upcoming space trip she booked from the Virgin Galactic in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000, which needed to be paid as a bank loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed for a year.
It seems that after an unlucky trial that took place in 2014, and even a death victim, things seem to be under way.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or at the latest during the following year.
The number of the Vesa flight is 300, and his journey is about a year from the first departure.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and there are 5 minutes at 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells about the future at its homepage.
At the same address, he also backgrounds his quest for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel and I saw it on Star Trek TVs.
Star Wars have been seen, and that's what the idea was about.
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
The City was a pristine host.
City continued its loss-free movement in Valioliga when it fell on Saturday at home by the Brighton painting 2-0.
The sixth victory in the reigning team season is guaranteed by the paint sprays Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to direct the season from the nearest point of his fourth hit to an empty finish when Leroy Sáné found him in 30 minutes at the back of the Brighton goal.
The agüero raised his own level to five when he sawed Sterling into a piece of the Brighton defense at the 65th quarter of the game.
The Argentinian was able to place the 2-0-ends at the scene of the punishment easily.
With six wins and one tie the start of the season in the City leads to Valioliga at 19 points in the catch.
One match was less than one match at just one point.
The first item will be held on Saturday night at its own seventh round match-up at the count of two-thirds of Chelsea.
Youth clubs chose new decision-makers in Joensuu.
At its meeting that ended on Sunday, the Finnish Youth Clubs chose new decision-makers for the next three years 2019-2021.
Anu Sivonen from Upper Savo and Petra Mäkeläinen from Hämee was elected President.
40 members and 40 alternates were elected to the Board of Governors, the Finnish Youth Society will be informed on Sunday.
The Youth Summit was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known about quality and security.
In fact, in its three-year policy objectives, the Joensuu Youth Assembly gives three promises: we keep the doors open for all, and we organise equal recreational activities regardless of the place of residence and background, and we support volunteering and people on their own growth path, Finland’s Youth Society tells in its press release.
Mr Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkö and was impressed by Ferrari: "To go to a very important driver".
In an interview with the Irish newspaper Blok, Mersu was asked about the British language, who believes that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton for the rest of the year.
Hamilton leads another Ferrari driver at the Q-point at Sebastian Vettä at 40 points.
A little less than three months ago, Ferrari told me that Räikkönen would not continue in the stable for the next season, and at the same time Räikkönen announced that he would move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think all of us are gonna be able to put our gloves on the counter.
I don't think Kimi will change in the remaining games.
He is an exceptional professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorites and I am convinced that Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told us that Räikkönen has been one of his performances.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and I dreamt of being number one, I played the F1 game at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday in the Russian partial competition.
The race to be started at 14 o'clock from the point of arrival will take place in the Mercedes Valtteri Bottas, the Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.
This evening's page is coming to the race right now.
The football A-young SM series championship became a full farce: the opponent only arrived with 7 players.
The top series of football boys will end on Saturday, when the final round of the season will be played.
The starting points for the 13 o'clock round for the championship were clear: FF Lahti For the Academy, enough for the first time in the first place to score against the Left IFK.
In order to change the situation in the last round, the second Ilves at the championship must win the PK-35 and wish to lose the Lahjas.
However, in practice, the Lahti Championship was confirmed even before the start-up event, since the Left ICK had arrived in Lahti with the power of only seven players.
If the scale had been one less, the match could not have been started.
F F Lahti Academy won the score of 16-0.
In the meantime, the Lahti led 7-0.
One of the reasons for the vassians’ stakeout is that the team has played in part with the same players the A-young SM series, the P20 series and the men’s C-block Two.
In fact, in the second round, the left IFK has been playing against falling down the whole period.
On Saturday of the 2nd round, the Left IFK will be forced to win the JBK at the visit and at the same time hope that the U.S. will lose its own visit to KuFu against Siilijärven Tovala.
The car ended up back in Enos, the rescue service said that luck was involved.
The car drove out of the road and ended up missing at Eno's Case Car on Sunday at 9:00 a.m.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, and the Rescue Department is informing them.
The work was successful, the bulletin states.
According to the rescue facility, the road was wet from the rain.
A police officer visited the scene of an accident.
Supo is waiting for new ways to find out: Device procurement and recruitment already made, design abroad will not be delayed.

Antti Pelttar, the CEO of Supo, tells West Media that equipment procurements have already been made for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is hovering at the video where she sings at the top of the body - campaigned for the awareness of breast cancer.
The tennis star Serena Williams surprises you again.
Now he is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing a video of his own account, where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, reports AFP.
The section is the Australian year of The Divinylsin 1991 Hit I Touch Myself.
Video will support Australia’s cancer Association in the field of breast cancer.
"I voted in the global hit by The Divinyls to remind them to carry out regular self-checks on their own [loans]", William writes in Instagram.
And yes, this put me in an discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because it's a matter of touching all women all over the world, regardless of the color of the skin.
Time-finding is all about a and o - it scares many lives.
The second author of the Divinyls song is Chrissy Amphlet, who died of breast cancer five years ago when she was 53 years old.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer, but he gave us an agitating session to remind us that they would give priority to their health," said Williams.
Video has now been watched twice as many times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, William is praised for his courage.
Mr. William resigned earlier this week from the Beijing tennis tournament.
The background is on the U.S. public tennis tournament three months ago.
Williams came to the main judge of the match and, among other things, claimed that men were accepted for much more severe behavior than women’s players.

The race of the Korpian reed ends today: This is the end of all this.
All good things will come to an end.
Today, this is what happens to the domestic country drama of Korpela’s garden run, which has been quite popular.
The production period of the month has gone like hot rocks: last year, 722 000 Finns were watching television as their first performance.
In any case, the peaks are no longer meaningful, for Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkinen will not be able to continue.
In the final period, in the relationship between Pyana and Mirku, we are again taking the planned leap forward, and I think her mother will be the first to guess what I'm going to have to do.
The between Anss and Misa are also warm, in the light of recent events, mainly romantic, but then once again the Skin appears in the images.
They also have a suspicious view of the man’s relationship.
Still, no one can predict the fate of the Body in advance.

Should we go to work tomorrow in a small flu?
For and against the facts
The flu season is hot.
Many scars at home or not.
However, you should wonder if others should be infected, as the disease may be contagious even if its symptoms are small.
Sometimes the symptoms of flu become sudden, sometimes they appear in the diaphragm.
Under the latter option, you may already infect others, even if your own symptoms seem to be small, says the Prevention issue.
So do you think it's worth staying home?
According to the Prevention, there is an infection even if the person himself has no symptoms.
The virus will be infected by the virus already on the day before symptoms begin and beyond five to seven weeks.
Children may become infected with the disease longer.
As soon as you identify the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can come back to work when the cough is burning and there is no fever anymore, says Professor Gregory Poland of Medicine.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the gym slow recovery slows down.
In addition, wash your hands, put your hands on your nose and throw snug paper in the trash.
Is it hot?
If you have to leave your home sick, you should be careful to use a protective mask.
Mask does not control viruses, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then you don't get to put your fingers in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
The protests are also limited to the mascot.
How could an infection be avoided?
The best way is to still have hands-on wash and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, average person touches his face, nose or mouth every 15-30 seconds, Poland warns.
Miss New Finland repeats the mission tradition: "My husband is a hockey player".

After a career in the SM League, a hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was on the Finnish team in the World Cup for 18-year-olds.
At the beginning of the date, the couple lived in a long distance for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I could get to the three winners and that would give me a brave career, I don't think it would affect our relationship in any way.
Although we had to live separately, we had to work well with confidence and, in the distance, the good thing is that the initial pain will persist all the time, Alina grinned in May.

Sustainable alternatives are being sought for long-term growth, but even the theory of a reasonable economy is facing major problems.
Economic growth has, for a few generations, brought to ordinary people, especially in the north of the hemisphere, a standard of living, which was before only dreams.
However, the long-term overrun of Earth's capacity and climate change make this market economy's rock foot subdued with caution.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere hit a flock in Pyhäjärvi - "Responsibly caught on a rock"
Inland vessel M/S Tampere drove to the pool late on Friday night at Akakkala Pyhäjärvi.
The rescue facility received an alarm about the water transport accident on Friday night after 12 noon.
The 30-metre ship M/Sta has run into a pile, and is firmly attached to its spring on a rock, described by the sun friend, fireman Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board the ship.
According to the rescue facility, personal accidents were avoided.
Passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland from the ship.
Now they're moving to the bus challenge, told Chief Jari Nieminen STT at 1:00 a.m. at night.
In the port of Visa, an emergency call was made on the outposts to receive e-mailed passengers.
For some reason, a ship traveling from Hämeenlinna to Tampere had sailed off its route south of a narrow Jumussalmi.
The police will find out the cause of the events.
The day-to-day fireman Matti Willman told me earlier that the conditions in the lake are difficult because of the darkness and rather severe wind.
According to the rescue facility, the fate of the ship is unclear.
The ship does not seem to be leaking.
The divers will, after the evacuation operation, take a look at the situation at the bottom.
M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is currently an inland waterway vessel, with a maximum authorised passenger number of 180 persons.
The vessel also has a meeting room for private use to rent a meeting room on board.
According to the ship’s website, the cruiser has been present in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
The freezing air will stop - see the day’s forecast in this connection.
Here is the weather forecast for this day and tomorrow.
On Sunday, the cloudy cloudyness is abundant and the rainfalls are concentrated on the whole eastern part of our country, in Western Finland the weather is sinking and becoming more sunny.
The sitting is moderate.
The daily temperatures are between +7 and +12 degrees, and it's colder in the North Lag.
On Monday, in the south and central part of the country, the weather will cloud and could become some kind of weak rainfall.

The Ex-Managers claim that Robert Helenius will not pay any fees.
The fight against Erkan Teper, a boxer named Robert Helenius's evening match against money disputes.
The evening-Sanomat news today was sent to Jaakko Helmi and Deputy Judge Jussi Kokkila for an application for late interest payments from Helenius totalling over EUR 80,000 in unpaid management fees.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helen on 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to negotiate, but there's no other choice.
There has been a clear mandate here, and a great deal of work has been done, Kokkila tells Evening Santom.
Helen's current manager Markus Sundman sent an answer to the evening newspaper explaining the events of the boxer's vision.
Helenius disputes that he is obliged to pay the amount required.
According to his response, Kokkila and Helminen had provided their services in an economically awkward situation with Helen and promised to be able to provide him with matches and sponsors' income.
Similarly, it was agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay only the percentages of its prices.
Repeatedly, it was assured that Helen did not have to pay anything but received their revenues.
This is also a normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
There has never been an agreement on paid work and it would also have been absurd in the situation of Helen, Sundman, to find out in the message he has written.
Cooperation was never a written agreement.
According to the response, Helenius would have liked to have agreed the distribution of income in writing from the start, but Kokkila and Sundman received a draft before the end of 2014.
He said that the proposal on its part was unfortunate and cut off cooperation with Kokkila and Helmi.
He has never been in contact with Kokkila and Helmi in his life at all.
One year after the end of the cooperation, Helen had been shown to be "intelligent but vast" in the work of the manager.
This year's action has been brought with the same arguments.
Helenius considers Helmis and Kokkkila’s ex-post actions to be cowardly, says in contrast.
Helenius meets today's boxing alliance in Stuttgart, the seventh Erka Tekka, on the challenge list of the IBF's heavy series.
A hearty man and a good reporter.
The entertainer and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Allied was the late radio drinker and reporter Erkki Lalli for decades.
Elkki Pälli, a drunk drunkard and a journalist on the line, died at 83 years of incurable liver cancer at the age of eight.
The report on the death of the host was published in the Sanhedrin of Helsinki on Sunday.
The notification will tell us about Palall's death on 3 September.
Pällli reported on serious illness on its Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was grieved by the knowledge of the fate of the friend.
He said goodbye on Facebook as before, Ile Vainio says.
The only thing that matters is that Erkki Vall is a gifted expert who became a great supplier.
He recalls the person on the Star who was a man who had quick boxers and funny things.
I got to know him as a little boy when I first went to Finnboard at 12 years of age and started there as a warehouse.
Erk and I got to know each other that day.
He was then an informant at Finnplati and in a different position, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I moved on to make a music producer with discs, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all parties doing stories about artists.
He was always competent and saw how big a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he went straight to the skin of his interviews.
He was a true man and a good journalist.
Where he came to be known as Yle's radio drinker, but he also wrote great newspaper articles.
Erki interviewed me several times too.
He was good at talking, Just thank you.
Over the centuries, Pälli worked as a journalist in addition to the work of Fazer's board company, Too Kärje and Too Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir’s plate.
However, the biggest passion of the bull was the radio work in which he had a unique style.
He worked for the radio since the 1960s and became familiar with numerous audiences in Yle's ether.
The bull is retired in 1998.

We were hoping to get him to college before going to the missics.
The Russian Dimitri father and the Ingerian mother Svetlana believed in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of Miss Alina Voronkov of Finland, who were freshly elected by Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov, followed with pride the first moments of her life.
They cut off the audience from Pertunmaa and were going to drive back home after the finals.
I love the atmosphere.
We believed in Erika the whole time, but half an hour before we arrived, I was very excited, Svetlana.
Svetlana is inserable and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks plain Russian, even though she has lived in Finland for the entire population.
Svetlana tells us that Alina was less interested in acting and many other things than her career as a miss.
Allina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should become misses.
But he told me he wanted to be a radio runner.
It was not until later that Alina got into the beauty contests.
Parents wanted Alina to go to university before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That's what happened, and finally, Alina wanted to go to a class before she went to miss.
We were asking last year why he didn't participate, but he wanted to finish the cover.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because she is a healthy example for young and adults as well as for young people.
He sportses a lot and eats healthyly.
And Alina's gonna be there, it's gonna be there.
Alinan's boyfriend, Jonah Hurri, is hockeyling for work in Japan and does not go to Finland to encourage love in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that the relationship between young people and them lasts for a miss year.
That's the point!
The parents hoped that the daughter would be able to visit soon.
It's been such a long break since you've been on visits because of the missi beams.
I'm sorry to hear that there's already been some text messages.
A young man died on a hit-and-run in Lahti - the police caught three people.

Sari Lippo left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - the idea of a comic: the lack of art in drawing did not slow down.
The creative mound left my husband's story, in which he proposed it to the story I developed as a person, relates to the espole cartoonist, the home mother and the former EU translator, Sari Pippó.
Sari Piippo claims that he was an EU translator for economic and legal matters in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've been very happy as a home mother.
This has been the same time of my life, but at some point it occurred to me that what it would do when the youngest child was already getting big.
The image with an image shown in the image is a screenshot.
The curator tells me that he had never dreamed of making a cartoon, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tintt and Asterix since he was little.
I had drawn the last time I was a child, but when these manuscripts of Creative Space began to take place at the time, the situation changed.
At first, I made a few dozen manuscripts in the desk box at the beginning.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a good drawer, but I could not attract her until summer 2016 when I presented Viivi Valkama (b.2000) with the help of a drawing disc.
His enthusiasm lasted a long time for the town's stripe, and then he had to start trying for himself, to turn to the Quick, which shows that the recording disc was a great encourager for him.
The record sheet is easy and a convenient tool is trying to get something up and running.
I didn't even try to draw the paper, says Pippó about his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
The manuscripts are always poppy, but usually I don't make the script at the same time.
It takes up to more than one hour for a single three-square stripe.
I might make a square at the same time and play with the color of my mind.
Starting a drawing is always difficult because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo tells us that he appreciates the dilberts of the magazines, including Scott Adams' Dilberts, about the second series of magazines.
The natural person is the mother of a carrot body with a salad hair soft, broken into the L theme.
The other persons are Man, Pissis and Twins.
In the creative world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the booklet come from their own life and social media.
Sari Piikki doesn't want to preach or offer an obsession, even though there's a matter in which there's a lot going on in the lot of animals.
The cue says that she reads her series with her husband and child.
I mean, it feels so great looking at the cartoon that you're drawing and saying that I've done this today.
And there are plenty of challenges and challenges for my mother.

Indonesian earthquake: The air traffic controller sacrificed himself - he did not leave a cracking tower until hundreds of passengers were secured.
Anthonius Gunawan Agung, a 21-year-old CEO, has risen to the threat of an earthquake in Indonesia.
Agung remained alone in the air traffic control tower until he was able to escort hundreds of passengers safely from an island shaken by the earthquake.
The young person was in turn in the air traffic control of the Mutira SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in the city, where the earthquake struck this Friday.
When others fled from the air traffic control tower, Agung refused to leave the place before he was able to take off the Batik Air’s passenger aircraft from the runway to the air.
Thus he could save hundreds of lives, and Indonesia's air traffic management informed AFP about AFP.
Mutira SIS Al-Jewish airport Saturday after the earthquake.
The air traffic control was froze and split.
In the end, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
Her leg was broken and she suffered serious internal injuries.
Agung was invited to a nearby hospital.
He was to be transported by helicopter to a better equipped installation, but he passed 20 minutes before the arrival of the helicopter, the representative of the Air Service told The Jakarta Post.
The shock continued to increase after the flight reached the air, and its intensity was finally measured at 7.5 Magnitude.
They lost at least 832 people.
The Indonesian Air Service has respected Agung's Sanctuary in Social Media.
Rehn was thinking at Yle about the end of Europe's trade war: "We need to look at the next twitter".
The US-China trade war is reflected in the world economy as a whole.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated, and the Bank of Finland has also slightly reduced its own estimates.
In Yle's first session, President Olli Rehn said that, although the tensioning tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions made by companies.
The situation also applies to exports by Finnish companies.
In Rehn's view, Europe is a good bakery for now.
It has been able to build a peace of peace with the United States and has also calmed the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to be going to the feet of a war of trade.
I have to look at the next twitter and assess it afterwards.
We have a time of unforeseeableness in the direction of Washington, but he said Yle at the interview.
There are also risks in Europe.
One of them is the third largest economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the euro area and the world's largest countries in the western world.
Yesterday, the market reacted sharply by the Italian Government on Thursday night to clearly present a deficit budget.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4% of national income.
Mr Rehn considers the situation to be a matter of concern.
Five per cent of the land's loan stock is problem loans and more than ten per cent of the country's loan portfolio is unorganised credit.
In addition, its public finances are in a weak position and the country is again demonstrating its cross-commitment with its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked if he would take Europe to a new economic crisis.
The second issue facing Europe is the UK's separation from the EU.
Rehn hoped that it would be in harmony.
The conflicting distinction would have a much more negative effect.
Rehn began as President of the Bank of Finland in July.
Mr Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), will resign in just a year's time.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his successor Erkki Liikanen's name have been blowing up in speeches.
I'm sure you don't mind if your Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that you're not going to comment on this further than this.
HH's super-popular Black Box performances will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are for sale.
The popular Black Box performances organised by the Tories will take place again as follows:
Other drafts can be seen in the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11th.
On 23 October, the black box will be visited for the first time in the Tampere Theatre.
There are still some tickets to the theater for sale.
The Saturday performance is sold out.
Tickets will be sold flag.fi.
The journalists and photographers present on the stage during the evening present a long-prepared successor, who has not been published in any previous HS tool.
There's something with me again that no one has ever heard.
"It is a strange spy in the night of Helsinki, in your impressive report from across the globe and talking about a very relevant health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the presentation, the audience will be able to meet suppliers and authors of HS and to continue the debate.
The sayings of these have been organising the evenings of live journalism for three years.
They have been popular and often sold out from the start.
Over 15,000 people have already been to the audience.
The black box was awarded in the Bonnier Gala as a year's journalistic act.
The winners thanked the winners for a new way of doing journalism, as well as journalists’ desire to come close to their students.
Spring 2019 The Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March to April.
The presentation is also being visited on the riverside and in Turku.
There is a different content from the one seen at the time in this autumn.
The lost Siesher was found by "an unprejudiced experiment".
The driving skills of the Finnish police are at the top of the world: "We're looking at training".
According to the principal of the University of Applied Sciences, the police can use a Dr.D. in addition to missing search, for example in criminal investigations and intelligence.
On Tuesday, the Oulu Police managed to track down the drone of the anti-hunter who disappeared in Raha in just a few minutes.
Director of the University of Applied Sciences Kimmo Himberg referred to the case and pointed out, among other things, that "with the help of pre-conceived experimentation and education, we are also at the top of the world here".
Drone is a very new aggravation and a newer police position than that.
There is no record that the Finnish police are the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has, for example, survived when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported at international events.
There's a lot of interest in it elsewhere, says Himberg.
Kovaska would be in the turkish for visitors to watch the Finnish police’s Drone.
We're being asked for training.
The general description of the information is as follows:
Himberg recalls that finding a lost person in Finland in winter conditions is very important as soon as possible.
As noted, in the case of Raahe, the lost person was found using drones only in a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drones already.
According to Himberg, they are meant to be trained further.
The Drones are already being used in the police field, and their use will become more frequent and increasing in the future.
That's how I dare say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to finding missing persons, according to Himberg, the police can use drones, for example, in an accident or crime investigation and for certain intelligence missions.
For example, we already need to check a region a little further where it may be feared that there will be violence.
Dronea may then use it for preliminary reasoning.
Karjalan Rugby was raised at the top of the hill.
Karjalan Rugby attended Kuopio on Saturday to win the 2nd Division.
The Joensuuns were still in the middle of the match at a loss of 7-12 to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found in the second period a plot and sign the guests of the South 26-12.
At the same time, the championship of the 2nd Division knew that Karjalan Rugby had a historical increase in 1-division.
In the past, the club has played in number one, but at that time Finnish Rugby's combined operations were divided into two levels, the MS series and the multi-digit 1 division.
The people are going to pick up each other, but they're going to know the job we're working on next winter.
The current demise of 20 players must be brought up to 25.
The 1-division also knows the increase in the number of games and longer games, so the funding acquisition must be in line with that.
The eagle egg begins its season in the Bay, confirms its head coach.
On the Twitter account of Claude Julie, the head coach of the Canadiens playing in the NHL, the hockey team, Claude Julie, confirmed that the Finnish utility Jesperi Kotkanniemi begins its season in Tartu.
On the occasion of the first round of the three summer bookings, the Montreal pledged the promise of the full-time promise of Kotkaniemi, 18, with the first round number.
The attacker joined the Montreal training force for the rest of the summer and has produced strong extracts at the September training matches.
Kotkaniemi was able to finish the finish immediately in its first training match.
Head coach Julien told the Finnishman that he had taken a major development stake after he arrived at the foreign camp.
The NHL hull will begin next week on the night against Thursday in Finland.
The opening round will mark the opening round of the Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's the good president?
This week, Finland has talked about a lot of leadership in Finland.
In an interview with H.H., the President of the Nokian Board of Directors, Risto Siilasmaa, explained his book Paranoid Optimist, which shows his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he criticises the leadership of his successor Jorma Olllila.
Ollila strongly denied the accusations, but previous Nokia reports have also spoken of the inability of the leaders to act as a team; fear and indiscriminateness, in which case the collapse of mobile business has resulted in the collapse of mobile business.
The company’s risk-taking and agility of the company’s take-off phase disappeared.
A Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki this week, which led the Finnish Business Forum to the Fair Center.
In addition to the capitalist Barack Obama, 12 business world stars emerged on the stage.
Good for you. That's enough.
The legend of leadership, Gary Hamel said that the good manager must dare take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are spiritually most involved in past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of the Well Foods trade chain, known for a wide range of organic products, said that the manager should be able to communicate to the entire staff for the purpose of the company.
This is not just about making a profit to the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the success book on introvert, told us that the most successful leaders are most studiedly humble.
They operate calmly, quietly and determinedly.
They are often introverts.
Professor Aswath Damodara recalled that the qualities of a good manager must be consistent with the life cycle of the company.
In the beginning of the beginning, the director must be able to tell the story on which the company's future is based.
The company that grew up at the ripe stage is the owner of the company that recognizes the numbers.
In the Nordic Business Forum, 7500 visitors listened to these guides - mainly Finnish leaders.
In danger, they had a flash of information.
A good leader is required to do a lot of things.
That's why leadership goes so often wrong, even at the highest level.
Silasmaa and Ollila were also present.
They talked to each other in a different way in a friendly manner.
I don't think they're wondering if they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
Their humility was not easy to judge.
Sara Chafak arrived on a beautiful red carpet straight from Los Angeles to spend most of his year abroad.
The model Sara Chafak arrived at the miss final in a fantastic black dress.
2012 Miss In Finland’s visible dress also had a laced laureate in it.
A little jet ceiling.
I came back from Los Angeles again.
I spend most of my time there, Chafak, much of my time in advertising.
Chafak tells us he's going to the L.A. screenplays.
Among other things, he has made ads.
In the United States, he describes the work as interesting, and also as similar to that of Finland.
The fact that he thinks he needs to do more than he does, because he always needs a replacement for his job.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.

The award is awarded annually to a live art field-based, exceptionally strong artist or group of artists.
The Danish police found a major operation on the Expedible Volvo: "We can't tell you what".
The extensive search for the Danish police has produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed on the bridges of Jutinirauma and Big-Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Själand was closed to Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
Officers looking for Swedish registration black Volvo V90.
Head of the head of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
Searched car has been found.
We can't yet tell where the car was found, Henrik Storm informs Ilta-Sanom about information from the Copenhagen Police Department.
According to Stor's, the black Volt that was searched for has no direct connection with the threat, according to the police.
According to him, the greatest danger is over.
Danish Extra Bladet told about the police Saturday's press conference.
Detective Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was involved in a silent operation.
He didn't want to tell us what kind of criminal code we're looking into.
Skov, however, told us that this is a "serious crime".
It was a threat to human life.
Three people have been searched for.
The police won't tell us if they've already been caught.
According to the magazine, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
The Copenhagen Police were also following events on their Twitter account.
According to the police, however, the public is no longer concerned about the threat to certain people.
The name of the House has caused decades - now the people are voting on the matter in a controversial election.
In the Balkans, a new name for the country is currently being voted on the proposal for a new name.
According to the agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece, the Republic of Macedonia would be designated as the Republic of Macedonia.
To date, Greece has prevented the efforts of veto development to become a member of NATO and the EU.
According to the Greek name, it belongs to the north of the country.
The referendum is not a new name, but a question of whether or not the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by adopting an agreement.
At least the discussion started relatively at a school in the centre of Skopje, the capital city, at least.
The retired nurse who voted in school, Olivera Argirosvka, wanted support for the agreement.
A referendum will mean a change if it opens doors to Europe and NATO.
This means a change especially for young people, he said.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) has been used in official contacts for an independent Macedonia in 1991.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the adoption of the agreement.
On the other hand, the democratic right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, it is exciting to see whether the vote will rise by more than 50 % as required by the vote.
The referendum is not binding, but yes, victory would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
Amendment of the Constitution is required by two-thirds of Parliament's votes in favour.
The Greek Parliament, too, still needs to accept the agreement.
Asylums will approach at eight o’clock in Finland time.
Handsome victory!
Mr. Zelenius was stunned by Erkan Tepert by Robertius.
Mr. Zhenius met late on Saturday night at Erka Teper's heavyweight professional boxing match in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finnishman took an account of his 36-year-old German opponent at the Waldenbuch on the Stuttgart side of the Stuttgart.
The main event in the evening was the Intercontinental Business of the IBF series.

Helenius solved the match in the eighth part of the day when he knocked Teper out with a hard left-handed blow.
Teper could no longer climb off the floor.
"Nardic Nightmare" hurt its opponent already in the third round, when the German nose started to bleed out of the nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were due to fight in December 2015.
Then Teper appealed to the injury and withdrew from the match.
After that, it turned out that the German had sprained the doping test.

Canada is fighting time to reach an agreement with the United States of America on Nafta.
The time is running out during the negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement between Nafta and the US.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the country's negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
The main Canadian consultant, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to concentrate fully on trade negotiations.
About a year ago, the negotiations for the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement to Naketa began on President Donald Trump's request to the United States, Canada and Mexico.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States agreed on each other, but agreement with Canada has not yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican Presidential election, takes office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that it is planned to sign an agreement at the end of November - whether or not Canada is involved in this agreement.
In view of these times, the text of the Agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready for the United States of America to have sufficient time to evaluate it.

The police caught 11 people on Saturday after the men in Espoo after the Honka-HJK fight in the West New York Police Department, Detective Inspector Teemu Värtän confirmed to the STT.
The reason for this interest was the protection of the offence and the disorder.
The parties concerned were released after the situation was calmed down, Värtinen said.
In the past, the evening Sanomat reported on interest rates.
The fight ended at 0-0.
After the finish, a large crowd of viewers rushed into the field from the view provided to HJK's supporters by the HJK.
The situation led to pushing and boxing fights between team supporters.
In order to put an end to the situation, horse police were needed, among other things, to stop the situation.
In addition to the field, the crash took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I wasn't there, but what I saw in the pictures, the situation was uncomfortable, the Värinen referenced to the mutilation in the field.
According to the colour of the incident, no criminal reports have been reported as a result of the incident.
The tabletop was shocked by the fly-sucking in the world cup of its Se time, Lakkanen was also able to swim to the finals.
Jenna Laukänen and Riku Table Table are moving to the finals on the end of the 3/7 World Cup competitions in the Netherlands.
The competitions swim on the short track in Eindhoven.
The HSS Table of Table was alarmed by Finland's record in 50 meters of butterflying, where he was at the second time of the beginnings on 22 February.

Students are acting in a rare way: the ancient tragedy - the simplified Orestee is affected by its visual appearance.
Even the ancient tragedy is a rare treat for the Finnish scenery.
For example, the National Theatre has seen the last ancient tragedy, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the University of Theatre brought back the only playtriology, Aiskhylos Orestea, which has survived the tour of the National Theatre.
In the Platform Open! projects that started in 2015, actors from the University of Theatre Actress students are working with a professional director internationally.
Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin, is the director of the fourth fourth project, as is the first project.
In April, Orestea received its first international night in Berlin.
The agreement of Orestia on the end of the bloodbath of the Atreus family, which was doomed to destruction, and on the birth of the rule of law, went up to hours and twenty minutes, especially through an overview of the choir shares.
The work will be very faithful to the person of Kirsti Simonmainen’s fine Finnish work (2003).
The dramatic lights and the disclosing display of the theater pages highlight a simple and bright stage thinking.
Its centre is alternately the dynamics between the performers who break out of the shell, play the nominal roles, and the shell.
The proposal uses both dual and tripartite seats for their nominal roles.
For example, the murders of Agamemnon and Kassandra, who are returning from the Troika War, and this war hall, are also shown on stage, unlike the ancient tradition of performance.
Of course, the proposal does not mean that it is faithful to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, in front of the eyes of the viewer, a modern, faithful translation of the text is created, which is a complete awareness of its ritual roots.
The sheer has succeeded in bringing out, as a whole, a number of the rhythms that occur as a single organism, among the actors of an acting stage.
Especially in choro sections, highly expressive, sculptive group formations, highly inclined actors can access their rights naked, only by decorating the white front, on the stage.
Very impressive.
The Orestea performance tour will take place at Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
The dual manufacturer prepares his first hydrogen load drum.
The news will begin to appear in Europe, in particular through the agreement concluded with Hyindai and the Swiss H2 Energy.
According to the contract published at the IAA Agreement with Hannover, Hyundai delivers a thousand car batch novelty model for the use of the Swiss company and its partners.
By bringing on the market a fuel-fired truck Hyundai continues with Nexon and ix35/Tukson Fuel Cell model by referring to the road as a hydrogen vehicle manufacturer.
With the first project of this kind in the world, we are taking fuel cell technology further and further.
We are also looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the fuel network, the Deputy Executive Director of Hyundai Motor, In Cheol Lee, said at a public meeting.
The fists fluttered several times in Kajana.
A little over thirty-year-old man assaulted three men at and at the restaurant in the centre of Kajaan on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one of the insides of the restaurant, which led him to be removed from the place.
In the open he hit another man in the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the assaulter struck him as well.
The police caught the perp.
The man at the station continued to act aggressively and kicked another cop in the leg.
He also threatened the police by assaulting and killing.
The man was taken to the cage to calm down.
There are three cases of assault and an official's opposition to violence.
Another case of assault occurred in the middle of Kajaan in the Middle East on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
At first, about 20-year-old a kayawist attacked the victim.
A little later, another man knocked him down, and the man who beat him before hit him was still kicking the victim.
The commoners pulled the offenders further away from the victim and called the police.
However, the perpetrators already had the chance to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajaan Police Office by phone at 5 4 16 520 or by e-mail at the following address: tutkimus.kainu@poliisi.fi.
Erkki Pällli is dead.
Erkki Pälli, known as a very long-term supplier, died of cancer at 83 years of age.
The sound controller Erkki Ällli, 83, is dead.
He died of an unsuspected liver cancer reported on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is it. This is it.
The doctor has also said that, living day by day, he commented on his situation in the evening magazine a month ago.
The safety of trade uncles and uncles must be ensured.
For the first time, I got a press release on 19 April.
This year's tyres, when something is amazing, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even a little angry at the moment.
I also discussed the issue of the Trade Union for Services (PAM) Labour Environment Expert Erika Kähä.
He says that criminal statistics do not tell the real situation.
The growth rate is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
The police will only be informed of cases that have been clearly serious and many of the right situation of violence will be ignored.
"There is, of course, an obligation for companies to keep statistics close to you on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain internal and do not collect their data," he said.
Mental injuries do not end in the statistics.
The problem with violent situations has always been that they do not always cause physical injury.
However, mental traumas can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
The difference between the violence situation and the threat of violence is difficult to draw when even a certain degree of aggressive threat must be considered as violence - even if it would not be possible to use it.
Too many people are afraid at work, even though the real thing is not at all.
The restless areas of the settlements are restless.
The deal has acquired guards.
The release of trading hours in the open market was also in the media a considerable amount of excitement for the safety of the sellers.
"Then quite a lot of employers organized security services at least for night hours and to prevent single-hull work," Kähä commented.
If nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is drawn.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but this creates a new negative trend.
When security kept the alarms well under control, the idea was that security would be unnecessary.
Now, how many places are trying to find solutions to remove expensive security services?
Mild assault is a criminal offence on the part of the lawyer, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been assaulted does not want to make an investigation into a criminal who usually lives in close proximity to the trade.
However, under the same law provided for in the 2011 Act, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecution if it takes place at the workplace.
I think that there is a need for precedents now.
The next time a trade aunt or uncle gets hurt, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should be accused.
If the right were to put a few assaulters in prison, and the judgment of the offender at the very close end of the penalty period, then the normals would get cleaned up.
A society in which trade must be open almost day by day in small towns must guarantee the safety of workers.
Heidi Sohberg signed up for the miss before the launch of a live broadcast - "Sara, Iro is married."
This year, the crowning of the mass will not be seen as usual on TV, but the broadcast will be shown on the Viafree website.
Mr Heidi Sohberg and Mr Viasatin and Mr Iiro Harjula, master of the Iiro Harjula studios of Via Playn NHL and CHL.
Janni Hussi acts as a backstage and red-faced leader.
Before the live broadcast, the host three told the guests and the media that they had arrived on the site about the progress of the broadcast to the guests and to the media.
At first, Sohberg asked the audience to give Harjula a bunch of gimmicks.
Now all the ladies scream.
Now, look at this man-driving, Sohberg glowed his colleagues at the audience’s cheers.
A number of priority races followed by many of Miss Finland's previous years.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Suppi sat next to each other and Sohberg threw a little joke in one direction or another.
Sara, Iro is married then.
Sohberg locked himself in the corner to the corner of the corner.
The more I think Sohberg referred to the recent difference between the Sepp and the one who turned to a comment, although it seemed to be a little confused at first.
The rapist spoke of his divorce for the first time in the afternoon-Sands weekend magazine.
Missunodar told me that he does not want to open the reasons for the distinction in public, as that is a matter between him and Roope Salmis.
He said he was not busy with a new relationship, he was trying to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff, and especially I'm starting to live my own life on my own, and Sara Seppi told me.
The resurgence of Harjula came to light at a later point when Sohberg was accidentally mistaken to call Janni Huss and Iiro Harjua Paris.
The host's three got pissed off.
Nororo was married, or how did it go?
Janni Hussi as your moss.
He tortured a bound spouse by cutting, girding and feeding a strong caste.
The District Court of the Ostrobothnia has condemned a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for three years in prison for a number of crimes against his common-law spouses.
Among other things, the criminal offence was a belt, cable and tie.
The court condemned those objects as lost to the State.
In fact, a serious charge was a suspicion of serious rape.
However, this accusation was rejected by the district court.
Four cases of assault, gross assault, coercion, illegal threats, sexual abuse, violent abuse and two offences were considered to be the cause of the Kokkola.
Crimes occurred between last March 26 and May 24th.
At the end of the last actions, a man was captured and arrested a few days later.
Last Thursday, the District Court of Ostrobothnia issued its judgment and ordered a 34-year-old to continue to hold Vaasa in prison.
There is no evidence of rape.
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two violent acts of vandalism and the brutal rape that took place on May 22nd.
However, these accusations were found to be unreported.
The case was dealt with in court behind closed doors.
However, the Court of Justice gave a public statement of the judgment.
According to the judge, the defendant had committed violence, threat and coercion to his spouse in situations where he had been tied up.
The accused cut the victim with a knife, burned him with tobacco, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In law, the court ordered the State to lose its criminal means: belt and cable, hooks, bathrobe belt, knife and stretcher.
A Christian sister
According to the snake court, the parties followed a common relationship between actions.
It is visible from the resolution that a large part of the most serious acts took place at the end of the time of the crime.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
The victim's 34-year-old will have to pay compensation for the pain, pain, suffering, suffering and such harm, totalling EUR 5800.
He hardly has any questions about the money, for the convicted person already has debts in the inheritance.
The imprisonment sentence is not the first man to a man.
The evening newspaper does not state the name of the convicted person in order to protect the privacy of the victim.
This is not the case when writing a fresh tip, but it is not the right thing to do.
A four-point Europe in the middle of the Ryder Cup solution.
European golf professionals, as a result of the traditional slot game fight against the United States of America, were imprisoned in the middle of the summer by European golf professionals.
Europe will lead the Ryder Cup at the 10-6 point in the battles of Paris while there are still 12 double games to play on Sunday.
Europe won three out of four round matches starting on Saturday, and in the afternoon’s four-game, the winnings were equal to two.
Europe's leaders were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four pairs of matches during the Friday and Saturday season.
In the past, none of the European couples had ever been present in the past.
On Sunday, the two aim for more history.
No European player has won five points at one Ryder Cup, and no American player has had more than three players: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters' violent harassment in the Honka match: "Victuring is not a part of the football game".
The football betting league team HJK published a press release on Sunday, in which it condemns the behaviour of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka match in Tapiola.
"We welcome the events following the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters", stated the press release.
At the end of the fight, about 50 HJK supporters were rushing into the field and some seemed to be trying to challenge the dispute with Honga's supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizations were not able to calm down, but police and also horse police were needed.
HJK will inform you that the team’s players and employees are shocked by what has happened.
The events after the fight do not correspond to the values of all our 111-year-old company.
"We are going to take a deep breath away from any action that threatens the safety of the match", says the press release.
HJK promises to help authorities and event organisers identify safety hazards and eliminate mitigation symptoms.
The Supporter Society is part of the coha and an important issue for HJK.
We all support positive, happy and encouraging activities in the field of football.
"Victuring power is not part of it," the press says.
An inventor of the Philippines flies a drone car to avoid traffic congestion.
Mendiola is a fictional inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Fearless.
He is now part of the world's growing crowd, who swears that he has found a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus, for example.
However, the Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of its kind.
According to reports from all over the world, a man has spent most of his property building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version "drone car".
Recently, he says he's made his first successful test flight - he flags his device at an altitude of more than seven metres.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic congestion.
I hope that the device will stimulate positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said according to British Daily Mail.
JHL foresight: Work-related activities to begin tomorrow will be visible in public health care and social and health services.
In the public and well-being sectors, the bans on over-work and shifting will be reflected tomorrow, particularly in social and health services and day care for children, and the President of the JH, Päivi Niemi-Laine, will assess the role of the JH President.
The effects will be comprehensive, and they will certainly be visible in such a way that not enough staff will be present.
Every day, you're gonna have to figure out how to apply for your child.
It is now up to the employer to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine says to the STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also seen at the beginning of the year when the members of the JHL were in the ban on overtime and exchange due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through flexibility, for staff not to be employed, but for workers to remain overtime or change.
This is not yet any work-related action.
It is, of course, absolutely normal for each worker to be cared for and done with regular working hours only for each worker.
JHL is opposed to action by the Government to reduce the protection of small businesses against the recapitalisation of small businesses.
President Markku Jalonen, Director-General of municipal workers, will not anticipate assessing the impact of the over-work and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, even though they may be weak.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the preparations for what to do.
The region is so vast, social and health care activities and the sector that it is difficult to say.
The effects can vary very much by industry, region and employer, Jalonen said to the STT.
Jalonen says that last week experience has already been gained, among other things, from the activities of the Super and Social and Health Services Union, which are similar to three days' duration of action.
Their effects were rather limited.
The JHL's ban on overtime and shifting concerns, inter alia, workers from the municipalities, the church, the state and private social and health care sectors.
For example, family day-care providers are excluded.
Work at this stage concerns nearly 100,000 members of the JHL at this stage.
According to Niemi-Laine, the activities of the JHL may take longer.
The Union will also be prepared for other work-related measures if the law on termination is completed.
The government should now admit that this is where I ran into something and a lot of stuff.
In the opinion of the nobles, both the Ay movement and the government must come against them.
What's strange about this is that the hard one is already in the pipe, even though the performance has not yet been performed, Jalone is updating.
The large coral reef is produced by children and adults in the fitness circles of the exhibition, studying the life of the horse and the sea horse.
The Great Koralliriut, a collection of other premises, received its first night last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Kantelto.
Like the previous works of the Group, the Great Coral Riut is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer proposal will also be drawn up, which will refresh and crystallise the initial findings in practice.
In the theatre play, there is a lot of fairy tale magic for children’s participants, too.
The child’s perspective has already been included in the preparation phase of the work.
However, a large coral reef is not a child's performance, but a performance that adults and children cooperate on.
It will tell you how much information you need to know and how to contact your child about this medicine.
The child’s ability to throw himself into exercises and joint games also dissolves the distance between adults and children.
A large coral reef is a reflection of a random, functional and nature-related information, but finally it is vibrating around visits in different, non-human conditions.
The large coral reef begins with access to the business paths of corals and of live organisms and fish on coral reefs.
In six different areas, among other things, the life of raccoon and sea horse is taught in life.
An hour-long presentation will be made in which music, lights and shiny paints and costumes will help you get to know the life of the coral reef.
There are both divers in the large coral industry who observe the life of the coral reef and the corals that are being watched.
There are still corals in the area of life that look at corals.
The eyes and observations in a number of directions make the presentation intense and life culling.
Whether it is a land of a living creature, a earth-view creature, and another creature or a land-viewing creature, and all this at the same time.
For a child, it does not seem to be difficult at all.
In other premises, the group is working on a line of thought and action to which it is difficult to catch when the group is composed of both children and adults.
Other children’s involvement will make it more important.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held at the Sittor on behalf of the endangered corals.
Man’s understanding of the damage must not be allowed to harden, although it may be difficult to understand the importance of exercising one’s own sympathy in the face of destruction anymore.
On the other hand, it has built its work in such a way that it respects the diversity of life also by means of a political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other forms of consciousness, other species and their future generations, for which it will be admiring and cutting.
Children grow up too fast - I'm glad that my people didn't have cell phones in my life.
Today’s children and young people are becoming more responsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking better and younger all the time.
I think that children should be a child for the entire population and not mess up their lives for drugs and sex, because others say so too.
I was embarrassed when my friend told me that he had had to pick up his fifth-grade sister at the weekend from his "boyfriend".
When she came to pick up her drunk sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't possibly imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned throughout our childhood that drugs must not be touched and sex is an adult matter.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent person and that they will not have to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I see a lot more and more girls in a picture of makeup on my face and reveal their clothes on top.
Snapchat is used in the evening to take photos and send them to the public at night.
Girls are even harder to guess how old they are.
Modern 13-year-olds can easily appear to be 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood was made up of playing in the woods and playing games in the woods.
I'm glad I didn't have a smartphone in my people.
I was able to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to wonder what other people thought of me.
Yle: The authorities informed the Government that the Air Force case is not related to national safety.
According to Ilkka Kanerva, who was interviewed by Ilkka Kanerva, the Defence Police and Defence Forces were informed earlier this week by the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees.
The Finnish Government has been informed that the investigation of Airisto Helme is not currently related to national security, but to organised crime, newsed Yle.
The information on the sources that appeared as anonymous was confirmed to Yle by Ilkka Kanerva (cok) by the Chairman of the Committee on Defence.
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and Defence Police were present this week in the Committee on Defence and Foreign Affairs on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered to be purely economic crime.
They were quite strict about not knowing that there would be anything else here, Kanerva commented on Yle's interview.
According to Yle's information, no evidence of the seized material has been found to date on the link with national security, but the investigation is only at its very beginning.
There is no way to know what can be revealed there yet, one of Yle's interviewees says.
A week ago, extensive home search started in the Turku Islands and the continent has raised the question of whether the investigation is purely economic crime or whether it threatens the security of Finland's internal security.
Earlier this week, this evening's paper prepared a case which will examine the arguments both for and against both the parties.
Video: The original saved a series of losses from Liverpool.
The 100 percent start of the Fallen League was completed, but it was still more satisfied with a team of 1-1 games on Stamford Bridge.
On Sunday, it will be the same year before City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to 1-0 guest benefits.
Then the Pep Guardiola combination sent the entire Valioliga signal that Pan was now serious.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure the manager of Jöggen Klopp arrived with the same idea in Western London.
The Reds had begun Valioliga in six consecutive wins.
It seemed that Virgil van Dijk seemed to be controlling alone in its own field.
On the other hand, in the middle of Wednesday's fine league guest win from An Road, the Chelsea had a low level of Wednesday's fine league.
At that time Eden Härd came by the exchange bench to settle the match with a wonderful individual performance.
Now, Darrd was, of course, with him from the very beginning.
At 25 minutes, he was first hanging out in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorgeho, the three-peeled Mateo Kovacic.
Finally, the cherate saw Märdi rush forward and sent a fully weighted power supply.
The bend went a little off the edge of the penalty zone, but bombed the complete left foot of the ground to the rear of the bet.
Half-assert Alisson was a little slow under his supervision, and he couldn't get his finger on the ball.
Klopp certainly felt that the loss position was mildly unfair, because almost immediately immediately, Antonio Rüdiger cut off Mo Salah's command of the target.
In the second period, too, Kepa, the Chelsea-Front, came to a conclusion.
The bankkeeper quickly responded to the Sadio Mané bet and pushed the ball from the point of view to the corner.
On the other end, Lisson, on the other hand, zeroed his throw-out on the road through Tord.
The best place for guests came at 72. minutes when James Miner found Bobby Firminon in his focus.
However, the lattice barge was headed towards the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the master’s leadership.
Nor did it last at 89 minutes when the dealer Daniel Sturridge was willing to shoot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing with his old home stage, and the assailant blew it to the top of an irresistible bet.
The 100% league start in Liverpool was completed with a 1-1 game, but it's still too busy - together with City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship with two points behind the edges.
In the discussion on time, the poters are deep.
I remember a few decades ago, a newspaper asked various Finnish influences that split the people of Finland.
The only thing left to think about was the reply of Juice Widow: N-Definition.
Some people have a n-end in their names, and others don't.
After all, the division can take place anywhere, and here's one rich thing.
In the EU, Finland has achieved the abandonment of the annual clock shift in the EU.
Many people agree that the shift of clocks twice a year has been the job of fools and has caused many problems.
Finally, this achievement is at least the easiest step of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy at all.
The hard part now is to decide which time it will end at: the current summer or winter or any other time zone.
This will also allow people to express their views on the otakata.fi page.
The questionnaire has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open on Friday 12 October.
The debate is going on in the coffee table and in the social media, and everyone has his word.
The defenders of winter time justify their position on the influence of light on human well-being and summer time on the influence of evening light on the desire for human outdoors and thus on the well-being of people.
Both positions have solid supporters and good reasons for doing so.
According to studies, morning light rhythmizes a person's day and gives a fresh light.
On the other hand, if you do not suffer particularly from a awakening in the dark, light increases the movement of people outside and gives you a better opportunity to try out in autumn gardens.
The amount of additional light after the normal working day is already zeroed.
I'd rather have both of them, but I'm afraid it's bad that we're located in the other part of the world. There's nothing we can do about it.
Winters are too dark and summers for many people are too handsome anyway.
A typical topic for the debate is that one’s own vision is driven and one’s other view is very strongly opposed.
The other side's arguments are not very clear, because the most important thing is how it feels to be self-aware.
Since there is almost no opinion on the matter, it is somewhat unnecessary to try to turn one’s head around.
That's what's going on.
The point is extremely easy to argue, because it does not require a major transformation and, as a justification, it is enough to feel a little bit.
Similar issues are usually debated more strongly and equally unfertilisedly.
Well, it'll be a shame if the right option is chosen, but I think it'll fit in.
And it always provides the right sin, too, if life feels a little short.
If you're not sure if you're going to fight for a little guest benefit, then you're going to have to fight for a little bit.
The first visitation to Joba in the Salibandy Divar produced a total of three score points against Nurmon Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoki for a homecoming pleasure 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
The Nurmo led to another goal at the beginning of the third round, but Joba applied for compositions and used men in chains.
In time of 50th seven brothers Eitu and Juuso Lehtiniem were plotting a 6-forward prize.
Both teams were playing the key minutes on a par with each other.
The most effective of Joo Joo Lehtiniemi (2+1) was Joo Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was also ardent when Teemu Cinderella (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettun (1+0) also hit.
Mika Kosonen (1+0) also played in the second chain at the time of his goal's birth.
Josba has six points after three rounds.
The next one will be O2-Jyväskylä in guests in two weeks' time.
Eno's church on Sunday's 200th anniversary.
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated on Sunday in part in a very sad atmosphere.
The arson of the emergency church a month ago was a shock.
Enon's church was guarded on two nights after the fire.
Despite the violence, today is still a place of gravity.
So, so no one would, the Church of Enon is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The week on the hill in the middle of the village has always been Eno's heart, despite all the municipal and other ties in the world.
The festival begins at the Eno Church at 10 a.m. today.
Then, to the church house, at the table at the table of cattle.
It's got a whole day of all kinds both inside and out.
The church building, for example, is at the persuasion of the retired, 37-year-old church master Ari Räsä.
The celebration of the church also means the end of one period.
Already decommissioned, the church house built in 1982 keeps the door open for the last time today.
We are now in a shelter in the same community building, says Kappa Markku Koistinen.
The community hall was destroyed by internal air problems, but the church has been standing in good health for the past 200 years.
Elon Musk comes from the seat of the President of the Tesla Board of Governors - the charges for fraud were agreed on at $40 million.
The motor vehicle manufacturer Tesla and the company CEO Elon Musk have agreed their legal cases with the US Securities Market Supervisory Authority SEC.
SEC suspected Muski had been guilty of a security fraud, and Musk was in danger of being excluded from the company that he founded.
However, Musk may continue as the CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to retreat from the seat of the President of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will have to hire the Chairman of the third-party Board.
The muscle will also be subject to tighter control.
According to the agreement, Tesla will have to hire two independent directors and further monitor Muski’s communication in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay each of the 20 million dollars (about EUR 17 million) to settle the case.
"The purpose of the decision is to prevent new market failures and harm to Tesla's shareholders," says Steven Peik's SEC Director.
The incident began in August when Musk wrote on the news that he might be able to pull the company off the stock exchange.
Musk also wrote that the financing of the company is secure.
The suite immediately raised the share price of Tesla.
SEC suspected Muski was guilty of a security robbery.
According to the Agency, the TV was false and misleading, and Musk had not spoken about the arrangement with any other management or potential funders of the company.
In practice, the Agency accused Muski of misleading investors.
She announced on Friday that she would sue the company and Muskin court.
SEC told me that Musk would be sentenced to fines and that he would be banned from acting under the control of listed companies again.
SEC's task was to scare investors, and Tesla's stock went down in a huge decline.
More than 800 people died in the Indonesian quake and tsunamis.
The number of dead persons in the Indonesian earthquake and subsequent tsunamis has risen to at least 832, according to the National Disaster Agency, according to AFP.
The number of victims of death is expected to continue to increase, as the resolution of the destruction is in progress.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The Friday earthquake raised the tsunami that attacked the City of Please, located on the island of Sulawes.
A warning was given immediately after the quake, which was, however, immediately withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all known dead persons are at least from the Palace for the time being.
The rescue authorities are concerned, inter alia, about the region of Donggala, near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
Already a few people are known to be dead.
Ironas are an inquest of the peace talks.
The Indonesian army has been alerted to rescue workers to seek victims.
President Yoko Widododo, who has arrived in the region today, urged the soldiers to continue their rescue work without exhaustion day and night.
One of the main places of rescue is the hotel in Palu, where 50-60 people are believed to be in the ruins.
The head of the rescue agency, Muhammad Syugi, told me that one person could be dug at night from the ruins of the popular Roa-Roa hotel, which is popular for business travellers.
We also heard people calling for help, he told us.
According to Syag, the quake and tsunami area would soon require a large-scale grubbing-up equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their loved ones who are missing.
Help me, you in Paru and the neighborhood.
My family members are still missing, one writer appealed to the Facebook Group.
Politicians' number numbers leaked into the hands of offenders in Britain.
Many British politicians considered it to be a problem when their contact information was leaked because of the deficiencies in the application encryption.
The alarms were accessible, inter alia, to ministers' telephone numbers.
This was an application used by the British Conservative Party in the United States for the purpose of the Conservative Party.
For example, Minister of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson, were subjected to harassment.
Several Members of Parliament received harassment calls.
Due to the lack of confidentiality of the application, the public in the application had access to the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app of the Conservative Party annual meeting.
The audience was able to access the profiles using the politician's e-mail address, which was easily available online.
Sign up to the profile to look at and edit the data stored in the profile.
Someone was able to change Biis Johnson's profile for a moment to an insult to the cartoon and title.
The profile of Michael Goven was converted into a profile by a picture of the media mobile Rupert Murdh.
The Guardian columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing down that the meeting app allows you to sign in to the profiles of other people at their e-mail addresses.
Then the log-in can examine the personal contact information of the profile person and perhaps send messages in his name.
The meeting app made each supplier, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticised it.
The conservative informant asked for an explanation of the data leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and that the application is now running safely.
The UK Data Authority ICO supported the data leak.
The application was developed by Australian Crown Comms.
The opposition Labour Party criticises that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, the audience of By Finland’s visit is surrounded by a large number of palpable Polish people.
Observers paid attention to the reactions of the The World Finland programme studio audience.
The world-wide, rapidly growing American format The Wall beached the Finnish version of Nelos last Saturday.
Heikki Paasos' hosted game show is described in Poland in the same studio in which other international productions of the format are made.
In Poland’s studio, there were exceptions to the presentations, since the format of the large 12 m high game wall required space to be held on the farm.
During the start-up period, social media raised the programme's studio conference, which was referred to as Polish.
There was a debate on whether the Polish people in the studio might understand anything about the game to be played in Finnish.
The manager of four domestic programmes Unne Sormune will illustrate the matter for the evening newspaper.
He tells us that there are players close to the studio, other Finns living in Poland, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The general public is composed of international fans in Finnish production, as are the audiences of the The Wall sections of the other countries described in the same production space.
Finland, too, has a number of kinds of pedigree, so-called professional audiences, who go to the description of the different programmes, so-called "Rormune" background.
He reminds us that following the game itself is not so clear, even if he does not understand the language that it is played.
The red and green balls on the wall are easy to distinguish between themselves.
However, there are interpreters in the studio for foreign language students who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who translate the events as an interpreter to the studio director all the time.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells us what kind of laptop they throw and what the situation is going on, says Sormunen.
He compares the situation with what happened recently in domestic production with David Hasselhoff.
David Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland's descriptions in our Finland a few years ago.
All the time, there was an interpreter in his ear, and he knew everything in the description that was spoken in Finnish, the sum of the ring.
The shift of a typhoon in the south of Japan towards the main island - authorities are warning of landslides and floods.
The authorities also warn of possible lands and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifoon Tram, but according to the authorities, major injuries have been avoided and death victims have not been known for the time being.
On the south Okinawa island, the wind has been so hard that it has turned cars around.
According to the NHK broadcaster, people have been evacuated into shields and electricity has been lost from more than 300 000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and bullet trains are in place due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike close to Osaka in half a day's time in Finland.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the storm route, but there are also strong winds and rains that are permitted there.
Train duty has been cancelled today in Tokyo.
According to biologists, Trami is torturing Japan until Monday.
The sky of the donkeys was still darkened.
The beginning of the ace has been bad.
As soon as the team lost its team on Saturday at home, the sky was almost as long as I could see, by the time the team lost its way to Vaasa Sport at 3-6 (3-2, 0-3, 3-1).
There are now five consecutive losses on the ground, and the score for the six rounds is a total of two.
No defender or player in the lower chain has scored yet.
The pressure is increasing, too, all the time.
Sport against the public with all your fascinations already at the point where the game was almost half the rest of the game.
Six games are only scared, and there is no reason to give up on this.
Of course we should be, because we were playing so weakly.
In particular, the second instalment was abhorrently bad, and Jarno Kärki, who has done 1/2-2, told Ässi that the performances of Ässi were excellent.
Sport's victory was itself a pleasure.
The team was down on the game on the line, so it would have been expected to be visible in doing so.
Maybe it did, but Aäst didn't know how to use it.
In addition, the sales volume of the day-ahead was further established.
The mother of the bread day, Pärkko Jórinen, wonders about the audience of the event in the view of the big hall.
In any case, it was thought that not so many people would come this year, Mr. President-in-Office of the Council in the afternoon.
In the autumn of 2017, at the same time as the day of the bread, there were MS competitions for the Tractor's Office, so perhaps the expectations would be that the public might even fall from the year before.
However, it did happen; the corridors were blocked long before ten, the sellers told me the product was over, the news was sold more than 500 doses, and even in the number of cars, Jórinen heard an increase.
The number of visits has been around 6,000, Jórinen will explain later this afternoon.
In the morning and afternoon five hours, there was a very large amount of programme for families with children, which, I think, attracted them to a lot of record places.
In addition, Jórinen estimates that the event will reach even further.
The sellers also hit Liper every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly 100 of the rapporteurs, crafts, pastry and harvesters had arrived at their breadmaker.
The mother of the bread day, Turko Hyvärinen, was admiring the public audience from the hall’s view.
At the beginning of the bread day, the harvest was accepted.
In the series of children, the beautiful bread of Teja Kiviniemi won the public vote.
11 different forms of bread came to the children’s bread competition.
The winner of the raccoon competition Marjatta Veppäläinen spent the day at the pie shop of the marts.
7 x the most beautiful lighting - here you will recognize a good lamp.
Recover the space, create the right atmosphere for decorating and read the book without getting tired of eyes.
It's worth the rain for a good lighting.
We gathered together three good reasons for the lighting.
The trades were created by Tarja Jokiniemi, the sales and marketing director of Industrix.
Do yourself a favor, do you mind?
The importance of lighting increases, the more seasons behind us.
Sufficient light can help in the problems that many will face with age, as vision is diminishing and the shock is getting worse.
The demand for light also grows at times.
Sixty years needs light three times more than twenty years old.
Therefore, it is worth raining already for health reasons on the effects of light and its characteristics.
I'm good at giving you enough light, but I'm not shocked, something's not right.
Creates a beauty around you.
Beautiful interiors only come out with the right kind of lighting solutions.
The interiorr of this moment can afford to choose.
The favourite is the Japanese style of the Japanese style, which is free of gesture, Scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, modern and play-retrotyl colours, metal with different shades or ice cream dyes from the 70s have also risen up to booms from the 70s inspired by inspiration.
Reality fascinates us in the same way as in the rest of the interior of the home.
The materials now show wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo in the materials.
Appear your world to be your world.
On the other hand, the house is now more ingested than before, and the interior has become a way to express itself.
Instead of mass production, you want a tailored, brave lighting with a story to tell.
People are clearly seeking Finnish and Nordic products with known origins and designers.
So we're very design-conscious, something tells us.
It is not necessary to obtain the latest trend light in the home, but a timeless class for which many years have been saved.
Certain timeless, cheesy and elegant classics hold their own from year to year, says Akiniemi.
Thank you and bye-bye.
The kooko showed a door to the Canadian hut after three games.
The paths of the cocoon and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell will be separated.
The Canadian player played three league matches in the oranges without any points of effectiveness, KooKoo will tell you in his bulletin.
O'Donnell transferred to KooKoho in August by a one-year contract, which included a trial period until the end of September.
This year, the 26-year-old assailant played in the KHL in line with Kunlund Red Star and in the KHL farm in VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.
The new association of O'Donnell is not yet known.
The player wants to show a mark on recycling - goods leave the world in recycling boxes, the plastic changed into paper.
In addition to the games, the Gamer is currently recycling packaging materials in addition to packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the stonework trade are no longer packaged in plastic bags, but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered online are packaged in packages from, for example, importers.
All the packages that come to us will be re-used.
We may use the boxes of the kingdom times, as long as the package is in condition that it can be used, Ville Pupurula of Oulu's Shadow Man tells us about Ville Pupurula.
As soft materials, the company usually uses newspapers and other similar recycling material.
As far as possible, bubble doors shall be avoided.
In the near future, we are going to move into recycled material even in the envelope.
The movement seems to be working with others, too.
Cycling is not an extra effort according to Puruila.
It's not a big problem to start working on.
There will also be economic savings when, for example, carton packaging is re-used.
In addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Buying everyone's fashionable goods: One and the same shirt operate in every neighborhood.
The class clothes functioned from one season to another in a costume other than in a costume.
They create a good wardrobe with their diversity, as it is easy to gather different dwellings around high-quality classics at a cost.
In the autumn, the most popular classics in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This includes a black pool.
The natural materials made of black needle in semi-colleges cannot be made to make mistakes.
The clothing can be combined with both straight shoes, abrasives and agriculturals, and around it can be created both in the fashion of a decent piece of clothing as well as a platter.
The pole is suitable for both a well-crowded modern speaker and a classic class-renowned stylist.
This is how you create the image.
The autumn trend index is made from gold-brown and wide-sleeved flat-met-shirts, black poles and gray mussels.
A classic pole, together with other classics, the blue-green strove and the wine-red permits, form a woman-like and discreet housing.
Brings it into the black pole by combining it with loosely-stamped clothing, such as jeans, high boots and thick socks.
Young and stylish.
The sabotage activities of the military intelligence services have a long history.
There is no reason to assume that foreign intelligence in the Russian Federation SVR or military intelligence GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage activities.
The name comes from the Russian word diversionno-razvedyványja group: the sabotase and intelligence group.
The USSR's officials in the West of the KGB have prepared detailed plans for the main sabotage sites, reports the archiver Vasili Mitrih (1922-2004) who has set up the KGB in the West.
His data was published in Christher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and in the early 21st and early 2000s.
Examples include ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, KGB acquires uniforms and accessories for cover transactions for Bundeswehr, railways, game guards and certain types of DRG groups in Germany.
This trick was used by the Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they were involved in local Ukrainian police riots, set up inspections on you leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from their mother country.
The agents of the Cold War were hiding equipment for sabotage groups with mines, explosives, lighters and media.
Back in 1998, Switzerland found KGB's hideout, which exploded when it was injected with a water tank by the authorities.
The goal of the police is nearly four wheeled drunks in the county.

True story on TV today: A climber was left to die a month ago.
An American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
Tonight's film was made on the basis of them.
Everest now gets his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996 a devastating snowstorm struck climbers at Mount Everest.
The guidance of Baltasar Kormakur for 2015 tells about the war of survival that has been discussed in grain.
The tragedy has been made to make films and documents once before.
Facts are also going through this case.
The world’s highest mountain took eight climbers’ lives 22 years ago.
Two of them were the experimentors of the expedition: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
Hall just worked as an Guide to Weathers.
Weathers' life could have been saved by an eye surgery that took place before Nepae left.
As a result of the pressure on the air, he lost sight, and therefore the power of the peak had to be missed.
Rob continued his journey and never came back.
However, the Weathers struggle for life and death had only just begun.
As the storm rose, he was lost and never returned to camp.
When a man came looking for him, he was found in such a bad condition that he was not believed to survive.
Weathers were left to die.
Like, by trade, she still got on her feet and found the others.
The misinformed Weathers thought he was still dying, and once again he was left behind for his own happiness.
It is clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even the biking campers began to believe the possibility that he was given help.
In the film, Beck Wea Other shows Josh Brolin.
The bank is going to be going to the bank. It's going to be a big deal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
The 200-year-old Eno Church has been celebrated today.
An Enon 200-year-old church has been celebrated today at the church.
The wedding was launched on 4 October 1818, and the whole family was prepared for the Sunday for the anniversary.
The feasts began at Eno's church at 10 a.m. at the family fair, after which there has been an offering of a cattle table at Eno's church house.
The week was full.
The meeting was attended by 517 participants.
Eno's church lord Armi Rautavuori was pleased that people had come to church so much.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to work, says Rautavuori (in the picture).
The fire of the emergency church has touched many, and it was not missed in the 200th anniversary of the Church of Eno.
The Church of Eno is now the oldest Church of St. Stephen’s Lutheran Lutheran Lutheran Lutheran Church destroyed in a fire.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the event of an agitating threat, a branch was held in which the church, which was destroyed by fire, was silenced and remembered by fire.
Pictures and Videos: The Medician flashed its power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street turned into a river.
A powerful hurricane-type September storm rolled on Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterraneancurrant or median has been named Zorba.
The Authority has issued a red weather warning to the areas of Attika, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Kyklád and Crete.
The images taken from the region show plenty of floods all over Greece.
The recent video shows how a river, rather than a street, has suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kitato in the region of Corinth, instead of in the street, because of floods.
The other video shows how the car has been transported by flood water.
In the south of the peninsula, the severe wind caused strong seagoing activity.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructs people on their website to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The delegation invites the Commission to follow the information provided by the local authorities and the information provided by the local authorities.
An Mediterranean hurricane, or medic, brings with it heavy substances and even a flood risk.
According to CNN, according to a study published in 2011 only once or twice a year worldwide, typically in the middle of September to October, when the temperature is still high.
The current blowing storm left a flood in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and towards Europe.
In Greece, there have also been concerns about refugee camps in islands, such as Lesboks.
The access of thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees to fair protection in camps is limited.
In the summer, the areas destroyed by rural areas in the Athens environment will also be subject to the storm.
There was also a median in Kreika last November.
We don't have to go to the sea now, but the flights are still on schedule - Finnishs are currently on holiday in the Greek islands threatened by the September storm.
It is worth noting that the journeys to the sea are cancelled and even walked on foot that no branches or other bulk are flying on top of the storm.
These instructions have been distributed fairly by guides in 3 500 Greece to a Finnish weekend on a holiday via the Sun trips.
The instructions will be needed, for even the Zorbas storm, which is intimidating, has been predicted to pick up the islands of Greece this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Crete, the wind speed may rise in the woodwork up to 45 meters per second.
Hard rains increase weather pollution.
Through the Sun Trips and Tui, all passengers from Finland who have notified their telephone numbers in Greece have been warned by SMS that they have been warned against being harsh.
In the air, however, the sun and heat are still in the air.
According to Inka Ikose, an expert on the communication of sun trips, the worst has been avoided in the resorts by the beginning of Saturday night.
Here flights have landed and have risen according to normal schedule.
Of course we follow the situation all the time.
Security ahead.
I supported the media officer Antonia Schroderus, who tells me that their flights have also been on schedule.
regular contact with our staff in the subject.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me about the beginning of the Saturday night.
At present, the most popular Greek islands, Rodos and Crete, have a total of more than 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundreds of passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on the island of Kos is expected to arrive on Sunday morning.
On Saturday afternoon afternoon, Rodox had a fluttered face and the temperature was in pain to 27 degrees, says Ikonen of the Sun Travels.
It is estimated that Zorbaksen will turn into the next Turkish state, though slightly relaxed.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have checked, for example, the number of Finnish people who have visited Antalya Tuil, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karviks and Janni Huss have fully identical evenings at the miss finals - so they react to the situation.
Median and fitness-beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in open-sleeved evening dress.
Hussi tells me he got a dress from Meslech.
I went out and decided to trust the players who found me a really great dress for tonight, Hussi smiles.
The exact same silver evening dress had also been chosen by Shirly Karvinen, the director of the evening dress.
The two themselves were also affected by their similar costumes and took a look at the situation.
Karvinen told the evening Sanomat that he was in a hurry to prepare, and he was going to put himself on the plane.
The Hussi works as a backstage and red carpet drinker in the mission final, and he talks about the arrivals of the front row stars.
Huss has a recent move back, since he moved from Kampi to Jähtsä Island from Kamp to Jähtäsä Island.
I'm going to stay right now, see what happens.
It is essential that there is a private office in the new apartment, Hussi.
Before moving to Greece, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful, I was just a week away from leaving for anywhere.
When the stress erupted, I got the flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
The behaviour of Shirly Karvis in an airplane attracted a lot of attention - to the curious eyes of pensioners.
The host and year 2016 Miss Miss Finland Shirly Karvinen told me of the Miss Finland final on a red mat that she had had enough to do with radio drink and Love Island Finland photos.
The rush has been sufficient to the extent that Karvinen arrived at the final directly from Finnair's flight.
The makeup and I put the hair on the machine.
This is the gymo. This is the gymo.
Dress change at home, Karvinen laughs.
Karvinen tells us that he has withdrawn himself among the pensioners.
The preparation of their preparations also attracted the attention of the fellow Members.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people looking at mirrors.
My dressing was of interest to others, at least.
Karvin flies to Spain once a week.
He's spending about a few days at a time in Marble. He's spending some days at a time.
Karvinen tells us that he has enjoyed his plague as the director of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience to date as well as a powerful one.
Karvinen tells me he's been to say hello to the singles of the program this Friday.
It's kind of real raw in a way.
They are people's true feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of singles in the program.
How am I going to cross-exploitation boots?
Three perfect costumes.
Ornamental clothing is clothing that operates from one season to another in a costume other than in a costume.
In many cases, the classics are decades old, but sometimes there are more modern individuals.
A few years ago, over-sustaining boots that rose into July and winter seasons have not gone away.
In accordance with their own terms, the boots on the knee-tops of their knees are re-recorded as elegant from year to year and from season to season.
The showy boots share the views of the users, but you should try a brave model, no - bravely.
In fact, universal boots are perfectly suitable for any housing configuration.
Whether it's porcupine, lace, tea or trike, the shoe's simple leather or artificial leather surface works.
The long boots look good both in the festivities and in everyday costumes.
The black overfloat boots are also very suitable for hempy housings.
They properly balance the pale, flowery ply and tender, smooth needle to the femaleness of the pink, flowery needle.
Fresh but autumn elegant everyday costume for romantic taste.
A strong and slightly retro-reflectored housing comes from a long copper-brown velvet dress, over-generation boots, showy earrings and a rivet bag.
Even though there is a degree of refinement in the super-generated boots, they are also perfectly suited for the relaxation of everyday life with a T-shirt, long shorts and a single flag.
It's wonderfully easy and still so elegant.
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo.
They operate for the rest of the year and take passengers, the City of Espoo informs them.
Venie’s robot cars work as a bus simulator, as the first spring area is intended to be run by a robot bus.
The project develops and pilots all year round rail transport and tests the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
In the attempt to find out how robot cars work on the current street network.
At the same time, the city provides robotic bus developers with the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Transport Manager Johanna Nyberg.
For the first time, autocars automatically run in other traffic without special transport operations.
The safety of vehicles is always the responsibility of an auxiliary passenger sitting on board.
Vehicles sense their environment all the time on several different sensors and assess whether the busway is open.
If not, they shall interpret whether there is an obstacle to the vehicle, bicycle or snowflake, for example, by reporting to the CEO of Sensible 4 responsible for the development of robot transport, Harri Santamala.
Motor cars will travel throughout the autumn on three days a week: Tuesdays from 13 to 15.30 a.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 15 a.m. and Thursdays from 10 to 15.
Motor vehicles will stop on six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The stoppages of motor vehicles are identified by a stop sign.
The safest way to visit is from a stop on Otakare number 1.
The moo-moma bassist fell off the stage at the start of the job and was injured.
The Mokoma Association informs on its website of an unexpected situation on its website at the Packroom Job.
The Mokoma Group gig in the Packroom got a dramatic turn on Saturday, when the band bassist Santtu Hämälä fell off the stage in the middle of the show.
The situation happened when he was drawing the last piece of last night.
The shady wrist was broken.
The band will inform the company on its website.
"It's all right!"
Santtu tripped off the stage at the last song in the Packroom yesterday and broke his wrist.
Let's look forward to a rapid improvement in the uniform.
The rest of the tour's gigs will take care of the reserve, page by page.
Mokoma fans are concerned about the update of the picture where Bassist-Santtu is lying on the bed with a chip.
This news has been expected, it was a pretty bad idea how bad it went.
The relief is great, the bones heal, fortunately, over time.
Simple and quick recovery to Santtu and a good turn-on for the rest of the band plus timer!
And thank you for last night's great job, but I hope you'll leave such a strong drama off the end of the gigs in the future?
Guarded hunting in North Karelia and Savo, North Karelia and Savo.
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Fridays and Saturdays with Metsähallitus and the Finnish hunting centre in North Karelia and Upper Savo, police liaisons reported on Saturday in the social media.
The main focus of the surveillance was on the legality and tolerance of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a required hunting permit in state countries.
The licenses for the handling of hunting weapons as well as the permitted quantities of self-loading weapons used for channelling were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the inspection and only one hunter, who was not subject to the required hunting authorisation, was found in connection with the inspection.
A 12-day fine was imposed on the hunter on an unauthorised request for 12 days.
In addition, police fired 133 drivers of the vehicle and two of them are suspected of driving.
The patrols also dealt with five traffic offences in the penalty procedure, police procedures.
In summary, it can be concluded that hunters are very good at following the promise of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the supervision of the hunter.
One hunter observed that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits".
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue hunting surveillance in autumn, together with other supervisory authorities.
Migänen is leaving for Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees.
Minister of Interior Kai Mikänen (Kok.) will soon travel to Turkey to follow the selection of quota refugees to Finland.
In Finland it has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkey's refugees this year.
Choosing trips are usually made twice a year and are accompanied by representatives from the Finnish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment, the Economy and the Police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in the Turks.
The UNHCR will first select the most vulnerable people under the conditions of the United Nations Organisation for Refugees (UNHCR).
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly desperate situation in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled people and sick people, women and children.
More people are selected for a group to come to Finland than is in the quota, as in practice some of them do not arrive for different reasons.
I am also meeting with civil society organisations operating at the borders of the Turkish Minister of Home Affairs, Süleyma Soylu and Syria.
Ilkka Salmi, Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior, is also involved in the journey.
Talking about raising the quota
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
The quota was 1 050 years for a couple of years, but no agreement has been reached in the Government since then.
The meeting has supported a quota increase, but the project has last fallen against the blues.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) recently presented a quota increase to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
During this regime, the visit to the deaf will be the first to be carried out by the Minister of the Interior to observe the selection of quota refugees on the ground.
Former Minister of Home Affairs Petter Orpo (cok.) and Paula Risik (cok.) will be able to move on to their new tasks before the visits could be organised.
Finland receives €10 000 of support from the EU for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going to go get some haystacks - you don't know if you're crying or talking anymore.
The Karelian news last Saturday on the bill to amend the law on animal protection.
The article took the view that the draft law in principle prohibits all animal husbandry, pets or other business related to production animals, pets or other business, which is not specifically authorised under the regulations of ministries.
So everything else is essentially prohibited except for the animals mentioned in the Regulation.
If the bill ends with a law, it should mean that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits action that threatens society's security or good practice.
In principle, we are now working to prohibit any activity which is not specifically permitted by law or regulation.
The amendment causes nothing new to be tried, for example in business operations and to do nothing else until the law or regulation that approves it has been adopted.
The conduct of the government in the preparation of the law has always been weak.
If we go now to the point that, as a matter of principle, everything in Finland is prohibited, which is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether it is crying or crying.
I have no doubt that the veterinary legislation requires an update.
But this legislative project is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but may it accept the "all things are prohibited, which is not allowed by law or regulation separately" procedure.
I hope you'll find someone who's reasonable to stop the progress of such a legislative project.
Metti Forssell press release: In the autumn, the four most trendy skirts in the autumn.

Kimi Räikkönen crystallized the reason for Mercedes’ improved Ferra compared to Mercedes’ Ferra.
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard to burn at times of Russian gp.
However, there is no need to panic at the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver will assess the situation.
They were just faster than us, but none of this is about anything else.
Our car was the best throughout the weekend in time, but they were just too fast, fourthly driving and meeting with their stable partner, Sebastian Vettt, for the sake of the Mercedes campaign, said Räikkönen.
Ferrari was having a hard time at the last race in Berlin.
A bunch of people asked what caused the sudden fall of Mercedes' rides.
They seem to go faster than us - that's the way it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know anything more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time there was rare sensitivity to Räikkönen’s coming stable, Saber, for Saber.
Charles Leclerc, who was replacing Ferrari for the next season, was on the news, and the last time-series was also on Marcus Ericsson.
The 10th race for the Swedish race is the best one for more than three years.
And even though in the second season there were only five drivers who left behind, the result was still delicious for Sauber.
And what about the encouraging Räikkös for the future?
Yes, if you compare them to where they were from the early years, the step forward has been big.
There's a different story next year, so let's see, let's see.
That's it - Robert Helenius was stunned by Erkan's work: "Robbe is back".
The comparison between the men and the men of Helenius and Erkan at the night of Stuttgart went ahead in flat terms.
A German was a more initiativeal party in the ring, but he did not get the right hits.
The clearer Helinius controls the match with his hard series, which found it well.
The Finnish person was also clearly in better physical condition than Teper.
The solution came at the end of the eighth round when Helen’s knock went off on the left side of Tepert.
The hit was so hard that the convex in front of the audience did not even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory, Helenius was very gentle in his argument.
In the interview, he was first encouraged by the public to create a good atmosphere and adversary.
Then he changed Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish subscribers.
We took the belt with us today.
He was blessed immediately after the match.
This was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
It might even be possible to get to the MM match, Helenius commented on the evening newspaper before the match.
On the other hand, loss could have ended the whole boxing process.
Of course, that's what you're thinking.
This won't get any younger, 34-year-old Helenius issued before he met Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may be multiplied by the number of victims of the Indonesian disaster.
According to The Guardian, the Vice-President of the country is calling on him to prepare himself for a marked increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims may rise by thousands.
Hard conditions
Saviours are looking for trapped and also dead people in the worst affected areas on the island of Sulawes: Please contact the port city and its neighbourhood in Donggala.
So far, all victims are from the Palace, the situation in Donggala is not yet clear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are hurt badly.
There are still people in corrupt buildings who have not been able to get out of the building.
For example, a hotel named Roa Roa in Palu has become sore.
Saviours say that they have heard the screams of those who have been trapped in ruins, but the lack of deportation has delayed the beginning of the rescues.
Indonesian President Either Widodo has assigned the army to rescue and deportation.
There is a need for the army and its equipment, as electricity and telecommunications networks are across many places in the disaster area.
Fuel reserves are also failing.
Miss Finland -fiction and long-conceived reasoning in the final vote of the final vote are the result of a laughter remamakaka.
New Miss Finland is currently being selected in Ruuknis.
During the interview round, a question was asked to each of the Missifilists.
The finalists raised the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
In particular, the final number of six Emilia Anttikoskoski, 23, a questionable answer brought about by sweet but good laughs in the audience.
The question referred to the Tottikoske had come through Facebook.
The user hellhole-Ella wants to know what's the last book that a Missifilist has read.
Anttikoski questions a good answer before he started to hesitate.
Thank you for the question, Seven-Ella.
The most recent book I have read is..., Anttikoski said a thought.
In the public, the report reached a time of laughter, until Anttikoski continued to reply:
The last book I've read is...
Of course, I've read books at school.
Must have something to do with economics.
The last book I've read is economics someone, Anttikoski answered.
After the reply, Anttikoski received a bunch of applause from the public to cheer up his laugh.
In the past, during the miss tour, Anttikoski drew attention to the fact that he did not want to pose in underwear for his principle.
2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 21.00, when the crown will be abandoned last year Miss Suomen Michaela Söderholm.
The ome perforation cake of the ome takes the language.
This recipe is for those who have good, acidic apples at their own risk, as domestic apples are at prices that are shocking in the store.
A head may have to be bought, even though quite a few people already think it's going to grow that pear tree.
This cake can also only be made from apples if the pear does not want to be bought.
Of course, the taste is better if the cake rains in its pear as well.
Oats of apples and pears and seeds of seeds.

Rukkala will hold a single criminal court event in January.
Kuusamon Ruka will be hosted for the first time in January at an international literary festival focusing on Nordic criminal literature.
The Nordic Noir event programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers and jazz music.
Among other things, Swedish twins Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist can be seen as guests for the literature of the festival, among other things, the star of the Swedish ledger Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sundquist, who are behind the writers of Eriker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist.
In addition to the Swedish names, we also see writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
Finnish writers will be represented by Max Seeck at the event.
According to the festival organisers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a framework for unique written experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts from popularity.
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admiring?
Researchers at the University of Sydney who analysed the matter have outlined two different types of 'cool' consisting of a wide variety of features: generally attractive coolness and, in particular, the opposite dissident-coal.
According to the description of researchers, attractively cohesive people had many socially desirable features: outwards, friendly, agreed and competent.
For dissidents, there was a typical distance, independence, uprising and mishap.
They were thirsting for experience and were only concerned about the appreciation of a few people.
Both types were associated with good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of hardy is no longer cool: a high status in a teenager does not necessarily lead to success in life later on.
This is what the study published in the Youth Development magazine 2014 reports.
Young people who were dating early, partying, looking for good looks and looking for other people's favors, were at an increased risk of drug abuse and committing crimes when they were young.
In their lives, they were less able to deal with than their more unnoticed agemates at the time.
A high-level lock of spray trucks, flags or watches do not make a person cool or at least truly attractive company.
In a study published in August in Social Psychological and Personality Science, the majority of people were more prepared to adapt to their normal brands than to those with their brands - despite the fact that most people choose to wear a shirt in the context of their acquaintance.
If you are on a Greek holiday island, be careful.
There's a storm attack on the ground, an alarm from the red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, water can rain as much as in Finland during the average six months.
The Zorbas Creepy storm hits Greece during the weekend of Greece.
Book if you are in the territory of Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, Kyklaat or Crete.
The storm is very powerful, so the Finnish Athenian Embassy will announce it on its website.
According to the Embassy, the Greek air services have given the regions a red weather warning.
The nearby storm is also reported in the Foreca blog for weather services.
According to it, the storm's hardest wooden wooden blades are up to 45 meters per second.
For the sake of comparison, from the beginning of Finland, the Kuusma storm blew at its hardness about 31 meters per second from the beginning of the week.
According to Blog, the greatest concern of the storm Zorbas is, however, not wind but heavy rains.
Weekend in South Greece, more than 300 millimetres of water may come in.
It accounts for half of Finland’s annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa has distributed a video of the evolution of the storm on Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused a flooding of Tunisia and Libya this week.
Do you recognize men’s drooling Love Island Finland -Ankun?
There is a gloomy scene on the YouTube video.
Rarely knows that in the Love Island Finland series, many men culled beauty Anku is also featured in a series of fancy Youtube videos published in 2010.
On the Video Anku advises explorers, among other things, to produce ink from the old economic paper roll of the industry.
Anku also seems to have a sympathetic style of how you can pick up a wing with the right spikes on it.
Now we're going to make Easter grass grow, but let's do it a little surprisingly, Anku suggests and presents sawdust, sock pants and raccoon seeds from which he makes silk.
You can view the videos either from below or from the Anku YouTube channel here.
Mrs. Bottas was shaking and purging adrenaline in Soch - is she going to be the helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Mr Bottas was shaking a little more than ten minutes after the Russian gp's takeover when he was in front of the media.
It was a great turn to leave the first of Mercedes behind Lewis Hamilton, who was certainly a spiritual critic of the Finnish reverend who had been here this season.
Have a nice time.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the solution in the middle of the round.
I'm fine, I'm still shaking, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been to the stake once this year in Austria (in the middle), and time has been quite a while.
This track has been good for me before, and I got good tours again.
It is not easy to miss the Sochi track, so starting is a particularly important part of the journey.
And, of course, Bottas was able to answer the argument about whether he is going to win tomorrow or whether he is going to lead a MM title in front of the approaching Hamilton jesting.
My starting point for the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
There can be no other goal on the way from the stake, Bottas set the stake on the stake.
But as a stable, we will fight for both championships.
The leader of the board, Sebastian Vettiin, is quite large and the difference between me and me is very big, so it should be kept in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas did.
Hamilton was truly happy with the success of Bottaks after the drive, and he was also seen as a member of the Mercedes stable boss Toto Wolf.
There was a intention to win the Valtter, but he failed to get locked up.
The Valteri knows that he must tear everything to gain by himself.
And he was so loaded, that adrenaline came out of his ears, Wolf hurried.
The question is whether the stable lets Bottaks and Hamilton drive the fairer, Wolff said so.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen achieved the rally of the Finnish Championship in Finland.
The SM series of racing cars rarely ended.
Never before have the brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the same time.
It was now done by the Tusulians Eerik and Péteren in the decision race around Turku and Salo, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiteläinen Erno Kinnunen confirmed his career's best achievement when the third place in the finals sealed him from the MS1 category of two-wheeled cars in the Finnish Championship.
The Kinnunen and the land reader Ville Mäkelä, which competed at Honda Civivi, started the Turku Part-Competition on a scale because the starting points were clear: the investment in the top group would back up the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, when part of the additional light was sold out with another special test, the two of them had to let down the balance.
That was a pretty blind third part of it.
In such a situation, it is not appropriate to be giggling.
On Saturdays, only the second series of Jussi Tepos were followed at the speeds, Kisunen told me.
Syria requires the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops.
The Syrian foreign minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallam said that foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallam said that foreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and he said that the war against terrorists is "next past."
In his UN speech, Muallam also appealed to Syrian refugees that they would return home.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
Over 360 000 people have died in the war.
Chancellor Angela Merkel told me this Friday in Germany that a meeting of Syria was scheduled for October, involving the Presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans were watching the TV on TV, which is the top court-martial.
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, and Professor Professor Blasy Ford, who is a candidate for the Supreme Court of Justice, received extraordinary numbers of people on the screens.
In the United States, the name drama of the Supreme Court Judge, who was in full power today, received at least 20 million people at his television stations on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, who was appointed by Donald Trump, and Blasy Ford, the California Professor responsible for his persecution, was told in front of the Senate's Legal Committee.
According to the preliminary findings, the hearings were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, with a total of 20,4 million viewers.
In addition, several million more were followed by an online consultation.
NBC reported that the Livesters were followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it had made a record of 8.2 million live broadcasts for the year.
The CNN number rises above 10 million when it is estimated that those who have followed the transmission via YouTube and Facebook will be counted.
Fox News Digital also reached the start of 8.0 million.
Digital outputs are their own channels, TV survey numbers are from Nielsen, the research and data analysis company.
Nielsen will publish final readings on Monday, but they will be all the same.
Hard to reach 20 million.
More than 20 million viewers in the United States are usually available only in sports matches and in the world of entertainment’s great Oscars and Grammys, as well as random random events such as presidential speeches and presidential debates in 2016.
Of course, there is a journey to the Super Bowl, the most popular program in the United States of America, the U.S. football NFL finals at the Super Bowl.
This year, Super Bowl gathered about 103 million people across the squares on the NBC channel.
According to Nielsen, last year's final first speech to the Congress was attended by nearly 48 million people in total and by more than 30 million people in office hours.
An excellent thing to do.
The title of the Supreme Court is an extremely significant case in the United States, since posts are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint one new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans managed to stop President Barack Obama from appointing his successor.
Another place you opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that you would retire this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on several issues, he was a so-called ordinary language, the vote of which could be reached by the nine-person court.
He was a supporter of the rights of abortion and sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015 he voted in favour of marriage law for the same people throughout the United States.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative than his people.
The Supreme Court of his choice may rule on the right to a Conservative overcrowding for decades.
Children have the right to have access to their parents' information.
Parents of children under 10 years of age are seeking their child’s health information from the Kanta service.
It's a big problem, it's wrong and it's weird.
Of course, the situation of Kanta was all the more important at the outset: they could not even look at the health information or prescriptions of small children.
The situation was temporarily corrected in autumn 2016 for persons under 10 years of age.
Since then, practices have been promised to be repaired, but repairs have taken an amazing long time.
It is now in force - in 2002 - to make it a reality.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than an open-ended case.
Then the layman's understanding is about the press of the button: when you hold the pin, let's open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents his or her information if he or she has a license or an official identification card.
But how many 10-year-olds are there?
The identity card is paid, and the ten-year-old can't even get the badges.
In practice, the fourth class information in the lower secondary school is not accessible to anyone except by asking for it printed.
This is not about parents' right as about the right of the child.
It is of utmost importance for children to be able to be involved in children’s care.
Of course, the right of teenagers to privacy must be taken care of.
Minors may also have family situations in which they are unable to talk about all things.
They often relate to health health, from which freedom of care is deeply related to human rights.
The F.B.I. started a prosecution of the harassment charges against Kavanaugh in the U.S.A.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI is investigating the harassment charges brought by at least two women.
One of the women was previously consulted by the Senate Committee on Legal Affairs this week.
Kavanaugh has challenged the accusations of alleged sexual harassment during his study periods.
President Donald Trump of the United States of America ordered the FBI to investigate allegations at the request of the Committee on Legal Affairs of the Senate.
The investigation must not last longer than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into a limited investigation, and it may not be publicised.
He threatened to kill police officers at the police station in Kajani.
The attached perp continued to pull up the bullpen even on the chamber.
The police are telling me that they put a man in police custody "to calm down".
The police placed a suspicion on the threat of a perp on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The authorities will inform the authorities of the incident that occurred when a fair 30-year-old man challenged a fierce dispute at a central restaurant.
The man first assaulted another customer within the food business.
This resulted in the removal from the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by pouring him down.
When a third party tries to intervene, the man hit him as well.
The trial of trinitization led to the call of the police.
The party caught the man and took Kajaan to the police station, the police will tell you.
The suspect continued to act aggressively at the police station.
A man kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
The police are informing the police that they have addressed a man to a police prison "to calm down."
The man is suspected of three assaults and an official of the violence against him.
Auxiliaries are preparing to begin their work in the Sulathes of Indonesia - "The Great Water is the most urgent of all"
UN Organisation Unicef and other international organisations are ready to assist Indonesia on the island of Sulawes, reports Finland's Unicef Information Officer Kirsi Haru.
Public authorities are managing rescue services, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
Besides normal operations, Unicef always has full emergency preparedness, says Haru.
This task is now to find people from ruins, both survivors and dead.
In the town of Sulawas, rescue measures are under way, but in the Donggala region, a little northerly, the situation is more unclear.
There are still places where connections do not work.
Aid measures are difficult because the roads are broken too, says Haru.
The buildings are often under construction at Sulawes, so the damage caused by an earthquake and tsunami is great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection - first, for example, tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in times of crisis.
For the first time in humans, it is most often possible to provide water-cleaning tablets, which Unicef also has in storage.
The aim is to repair water systems as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is transported, for example, by trucks.
In crisis situations, many children get separated from their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification are part of the task of Unicef.
The food aid is being reorganised, among other things, by the World’s Rules of Procedure (WFP) as part of the United Nations (World Food Programme).
In the initial phase, the funds collected in the past will be used for emergency aid.
However, among other things, Unicef has already started a collection of money to assist victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunamis.
Billionary Elon Musk will cease as Chairman of the Tesla Board - fines of $20 million for tweets.
The founder Elon Musk of companies that manufacture space and electric vehicles prevents fraud with the US Securities Commission.
Billionary Elon Musk ends his duties as Chairman of the Tesla Board of an electric car company and agrees to fines of $20 million.
Musk fails to perform the task as part of the agreement he concluded with the US Securities and Markets Authority.
By means of an agreement, Musk will prevent the prosecution of fraud.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Muski for fraud because of the twits he sent in August.
In them Musk wrote that he prepares the withdrawal of Tesla from the stock exchange of the electric car company, which resulted in a rapid increase in the company’s share price.
According to the agreement, Musk must not act as President of the Tesla Board for a period of three years.
In addition, Tesla will have to appoint a new "independent member" of its government and take two "independent directors" to take over its board.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Muski's communication.
Musk can still continue as the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Muski's personal $20 million fines, Tesla also has to pay the corresponding 20 million fines to the financial controller.
Twiits led investors to be misled by the investors.
According to SEC, Muskin's twitters misguided investors and Tesla's shareholders.
Musk claimed that he would have secured the financing by which Tesla would buy back from the stock exchange as a private limited company.
According to billionaires, the company would have been bought out of the stock exchange at $420 a share price.
Tesla's share price rose by more than 10 per cent, but later, after the twits, by more than ten per cent.
According to the SC, Muski's claims had no basis at all.
According to the supervisor, he had not actually negotiated the money he claimed to have claimed.
Furthermore, he had not discussed the withdrawal from the stock exchange with the other board of directors or the company's board of directors.
This afternoon's exchange rate fell by 14 per cent when SEC, the securities depositor, reported the case of fraud.
The new agreement is expected to re-confirm the company's price.
The final judgment is not a reason.
On the other hand, the bells of the church do not ring when the beads do not move.
This is a technical error.
The clock of the Tower of the Court of Justice has stopped.
The Philistines saw him at 12 o'clock.
The situation is like the average horror film: while the church's crypt would be a part of the exorcism and the bodies would be themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it has broken down.
It's been checked by a repairer, but some of it's broken and is expected to have a new part," says Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the Church in Helsinki -Twitter account as already mentioned.
The account mentions that the final judgment is not the reason why the clock stops.
Jamsen tells us that church bells don't ring because of error.
