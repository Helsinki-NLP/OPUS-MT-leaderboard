In addition to EU business subsidies, the management of national aid for SMEs will also be concentrated on four eley centres from mid September onwards.
In Eastern Finland, South Savo is responsible for its activities in Mikkeli, the Ely Centre for South Savo.
According to the new Act on Aid for Enterprises, which entered into force at the beginning of July, EU Structural Fund aid may no longer be allocated to large enterprises unless it is fully operational.
The subsidiaries of the municipalities of more than five thousand inhabitants are also counted as large honors.
On the other hand, investments that improve local authorities' conditions may continue to be eligible for EU aid.
In Eastern Finland, the strength of the EU and national aid management units will be around 30 people.
At least for the time being, they all continue to work at their current locations.
For example, Kalevi Pölös, Head of the South Savo Ely Centre's Structural Fund Unit, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now working on in Ukraine.
It works in a consistent way, even though it always doesn't look like it does.
Head of the Board of the Ministry of Defence of the University of Defence, Colonel Lieutenant, Docent Torsti Siren was not surprised at the Monday-morning Ukraine news.
This has been the same thing for a long time, siren says.
At that time, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
Here, Ukraine reports that its parachutists are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhanski Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmations (read more here).
Lavrov called for an immediate cease-fire without conditions to be achieved in the Minsk negotiations.
The Russians dispute their participation and need to get the results of the meeting up to date in order to gain their established position in Luhansk and Donetsk immediately.
That's the whole thing, siren says.
This is the big picture: we have to start going to the country, and it is precisely so that Russia gets its own hold of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.
Finnair deports passenger services to the Norwegian company, gives the people a leave.
Finnair is starting to purchase passenger services as a subcontractor from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
It concerns first-stage Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore routes, but it will be extended later.
The appearance of two routes leads to a total reduction of about 100 staff years in Finland during the first phase of layoffs, the company reported its information.
In addition, the work of some 80 Asian temporary workers will end at the point when the routes are outdoors.
Finnair already told us in June that it was planning to make some 20 routes of passenger accommodation available over the next two years.
The discussions ended when no agreement was reached on savings with staff.
External relations are due to begin next year in January-March.
According to the pilot, negotiations on cooperation will also be conducted with other partner candidates.
According to the survey, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, i.e. shock pain, for those who work hard shifts.
The study of the occupational health service followed fires for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disturbances to the shock tree is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and durability of employees, which are regularly tested, do not seem to protect against pain, reports the director of the study, docent Sirpa lusa at the Institute of Health and Safety at Work.
The work of firemen is irregular shifting, where shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a study carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you feel the new causes of water damage?
They are easily causing damage to other dwellings.
Water damage Water damage is not necessarily caused by leaking pipe or taps, reminds the expert of the Association of Hosts.
We have received feedback when the breach of the aquarium has caused the water damage of the household company that it is possible to deny aquariums, says Marina Puhuhjem, the legal expert of the Association of Hosts.
I would point out that only pipes and sewers are not a common cause of water damage, but also more and more new plants, such as ice burners, have caused water leaks in housing.
Many people do not know that machines such as washing machines or washing machines must not be left unsupervised.
Water must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the pipe can lead to water leakage.
A resident may be considered to have committed negligence if these obligations have been neglected, in which case he/she is liable for the damage incurred by the resident.
In such cases, home insurance may be liable for damage, depending on the conditions and case of insurance.
If it can be demonstrated that the resident has caused injury by negligence, the resident will be liable for the damage.
If a resident has passed out in the shower on the ground mine, the discharge can often be proven because, usually in such cases, the water has flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes into an apartment where a person who has passed out will come into the apartment.
History tells us that due to the increase in flooding of the ground mines, there are now two underground mines in many student housings installed in the shower spaces.
Water damage has also been caused by waterbeds, although not as much as before when they were more popular.
Even the dog’s water cup and the fall of the domestic wine can become real water damage.
I also know of the case of many cats in the apartment that had peed on the floors so that there was extensive damage, M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M. M
The principle of liability always goes in the same way if the company’s statute does not provide otherwise.
The shareholder shall be responsible for the repair of the material and for the damage to the structure of the building and for the damage to other housing.
Water pollution can easily cause damage to other housing, because concrete in the structure really absorbs water easily.
According to the description, the battery leaks in dwellings are particularly difficult because batteries are easily leaked into structures.
Water damage can be caused by now common air heat pumps that produce condensing water.
Water should lead to a solid sewage or rainwater network, rather than just a vessel.
It is also the responsibility of the participant to remove water, snow, ice and waste from the balcony, advises the lawyer.
In particular, since the company rules do not require, for example, a close removal of the washing machine, there may be a condition in the insurance that the compensation is therefore not due to be paid.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policies.
However, I consider, for example, the separate water-extinguishing pipes led to the tub as a high risk of serious damage to the washing machine.
I recommend that removals are always closely channelled into the drain pipe.
Removal of snow and water by balcony
Control of washing machines, washing machines, etc. machinery, while on.
Closure of water supply (washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the mine is expected to be twice a year in half a year.
Its purpose is to switch the removal streams to the sewer tightly.
Check the hens and their bleeds as much as possible.
Formal freezing of the freezer, the original sealing of the freezer shall be carried out.

FC Honka lost again and threw away as a serial jumbo.
On Sunday evening in Tapiola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams at the moment met at the Fleet League's gym.
FC Honka, the last winner of the victory in June, hosted the seven-game winning zone to sail Vaasa’s Pallulga.
VPS just took his previous victory against Honka in July.
On Sunday’s encounter with the espolas team came to a good pace, for VPS returned for a long time to the profit margin of 2-1.
Mr Olli Huttunen, head coach of the Vaas, complained before the game about the inefficiency of his team, but the mixed Honka defence has facilitated VPS's goalmaking problems.
It's a very nervous performance that's playing out.
We didn't get any more attacks at all, we didn't get a ball," Huttunen assessed his own performance.
In the first half of Honga's top-notch, Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev, who played in the first half, was very uncertain.
Both the paints of the Vases were created as a result of the loose play of the tops.
The opening ground of the fight was only seen after five minutes of the game, when Steven Morrissey directed the Hong Kong Governor Walter Five, who lost the shot at Sebastian Strandvall.
Disgrace the first half of the time.
The team on the field did what was agreed before the game", Head Coach Shefki Kuqi of Honga, your country.
After the initial attack, the es Poles got their game together and rolled the ball at the head of the attack.
In particular, the middle-field player, Mr. Portela, and Mr. Roni Porocara, were eager to seek out jobs, but the last solutions were almost repeatedly unfortunate.
The nearest goal was Jussi Vasara, the Honga middle courtman, whose 20-metre shot went a little past VPS.
VPS hit effectively against using its quick attackers and Honga's crazy top-tip head.
At half an hour, the whites made a 2-0, when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart reached two rounds.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was at a good game point during the opening period and created situations from the left on a regular basis.
The speed of Stewart's speed, on the other hand, seemed to be too much for the sesparte defence throughout the game.
"I heard in half that if we lose, then we lose at first," Kuqi told me.
The engrossed Honka applied for the second period in a frenzy fashion.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third company succeeded.
The boxer Yerai Vilaboa finished the paint in the middle of the penalty zone.
After Vilaboa's goal, Honga had half an hour to balance the match.
The Estonian team took more and more of the risks that gave VPS the opportunity to engage in dangerous counterattacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey got back to the cleverest with Viita, but the horrendous fights against the Honka-Major were playing with the home team.
After the end of the year, Honka was a little propped up and did not get the additional ones for the time being.
With the loss, Honka is the last one in the Fleet League to take place when there are still seven matches left.
Magazine: Putin was proud of being able to take over Kiev two weeks a week or two.
President Vladimir Putin, President of the European Commission, was very busy in a phone conversation with José Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, says Italian La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his feelings about the European Union's plans to impose sanctions against Russia.
If I want, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica will tell you that Putin has said.
According to the magazine, Putin's message to Barroso was this: It is not worth pushing Russia on with new sanctions.
Putin opened an interview on Russia's television at the top channel on Sunday night about the Ukrainian crisis.
Putin told the interview that he was keeping the conflict entirely between Ukraine and urged the Kievn Government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev about the fire of recently mentioned sites in the East.
Russia "can't watch side by side" if people are shot to death in close proximity, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The actor's work destroyed the family.
The hard work of the Concaritor and the theatre family increased the recognition of how the actor's profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine will be spending 70 years next Friday, but I think she's got a valid saying that age is just a number.
I can't see any difference compared to a year back or two years or ten years ago.
The mental pubesity seems to continue, Esko Roine says.
Roine has been retired for years, but still she's been working hard for many men.
It was a joke that there would be no play in this country without Esko Roinette.
At present, Roine has roles in the play of the Helsinki City Theatre How to succeed in business, in the mental administrator of the Tampere Labour Theatre and in the Kvartet of the Tampere Comedy Theatre.
Roine will also be seen in the future movie Risto Räpääja -film.
PHOTO: Reijo Hietanen
The role of Roine's actor was not a good start.
I didn't want to go to school with a flat-boy movie at school.
40-50 years later, the teacher told me the reason why I was so bad.
Eko Roine was not discouraged.
The choice of career was clear; there was no alternative.
It felt close and dear.
I was so busy in the field that I left school and went to the army as a volunteer just to get to the medical school as soon as possible.
Roine has made about 200 roles and 300 TV shows, depending on how they are calculated.
If you're going to work like an Englishman, that every part of the TV series has its own show, then there's more than 600 TV cases.
After all, I was three years in the New Day, which took place three cycles a week.
Last spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Eiko's great-grandfathers Eila, 83, and Liisa 76, are in full swing and are doing great roles as an archived mummy in the Tampere Workers' Theatre Time and Date Show.
A little brother's gonna be in the field for years.
Well, it seems that way now, but you don't know about this age.
Always have to take a small reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar contains reservations for the autumn of 2003.
For years, they have left the man behind as well.
And you can't be alone.
Knives have been operated on, the hips are ringing and the joints are busy, but if you don't let it bother you, you'll get it, Esko Roine says.
Roine became familiar with the television network, including the
From the maritime radio, and from a brawl where he and Antti Einio shared hundreds of hundreds, bills of $100 marks.
It was Antti Einiö, who divided crops.
I was trying to tell you that it's raining and it's not raining.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was the most valuable Lieutenant Rautakallio.
He became the favorite of the police officers, at the institution when it happened to be the same Lieutenant in the same situation.
One of the police officers stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled at me, "That Rautakallio is great!"
The working group has been successful.
About the theatre work Roeja's mind has remained, among other things, in her mind.
Producer and Master Class of the Helsinki Theatre, the death of the merchant of the Tampere Labour Theatre and the long-term trip to the night of Tampere Theatre.
All that has to do with the fact that the demonstrations have been popular.
It's not my fault, it's my job. It's my job. It's my job.
There have also been rituals.
There's one of those who's gonna play a toy in the game.
There's more to it than that.
The reason is that I have agreed too easy.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the result is neither myself nor the viewers' satisfaction.
As an actor, you will not be able to choose your own work.
It's just nicely done what's been said to me.
In addition to the theatre work, Roine has tried to succeed in business as well as in business.
In the '80s, he was holding a restaurant called Wanhat Roomeot.
It was an educational experience.
It didn't work out at all when I was trying to be the CEO, actor and then a restaurant manager at the same time.
If I recall correctly, within a year, it became clear that they should not be coordinated in any way.
Typically, when the show was on its own or in between, and I already have time to think about whether I'm going to put on a sauna, the restaurant became a call, that there are your friends here who hope to see you after the show.
Memories for the birthday.
On the birthday of Esko Roine, memories appear, writing by Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've created some kind of mutilation from the facial imagery.
I was once called a face-retort when I was playing the game at the Seed.
They didn't say I knew them. They didn't say I knew them.
The book has been written for years.
Roine once told me that no news bombs are allowed, because she hasn't done anything so violent, or if she does, she won't tell me.
I made a little phrase in the book.
I'm saying that if someone's waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading this.
There's a lot of business involved there, as an actor and as a CEO.
The publisher states that there is also a tournament about the unsatisfied period of the doctoral school.
It was a pretty normal student life, but I'm sure a kid came to do all kinds of tricks that look like him.
It wasn't as fun as it was when I was around the clock.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more I got out of there than knowing that when I've been to school, I know that it's not really up to you if you don't get better.
You didn't have to think how good I was at all if I had gone to school.
Roine also recalls the waves of the National Theatre.
I made friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häirinen, and I was able to work with them.
Of course, there was a wave from my first aid unit, starting with the Kaarlo Hättus.
Pia and Hattar and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I was able to get to know him during school hours.
Martti, the middle son of the high school, was with me at the same course.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Halttunen.
The bitter thing is, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in a way that the daughter went to her mother and son to me.
I didn't think it was a good solution, and I think I quite agree with you as an adult right now.
In theatre circles, it is not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In our case, some part of it was that I did a lot of work all the time.
I was in the theater almost every case closed.
Then there was TV and radio on top of it.
I've had a long day and family life is suffering.
At the day of the convention, you are free to leave.
Esko Roine threw a party at the Theatre of the Tampere Workers on September 7th.
The ceremony will take place in Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
There's a mind-wreaker snooping at you, too.
I was 50 years old at work and 50 years old at work at work.
When such a moving drama occurred, I thought we'd have the '80s now, so we can get 'em off with one rhythm.
According to Roja, there is no celebration on a real birthday.
I think it's free, but I won't swear.
I may have lost a job that day.
Or maybe there's a side of the freeway I'm going to have on the night off, Roine says.
The industry’s companies are concerned about the production chain of the industry.
Some of the smaller manufacturers of aircraft in Great Britain are concerned that the problems in the production capacity in the supply chain may cut off the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In the United Kingdom, thousands of companies in the manufacturing chain of aircraft production currently benefit from an unexpected number of current aircraft and engine plans.
Air and defence
While others enjoy the order period, warnings have been given about the capacity problems and price pressure at hand in the production chain.
"It is true that price pressure exists, especially now that the volume of production presents challenges," says Craig Gallagher, director of MB Aerospace, of the main suppliers of aircraft manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the Executive Director of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing the supplier of North West Aerospace Industry in the north-west of England, there is a need for more capacity.
"Do they respond to these growth plans?
Actually, I'm not quite sure about that.
We need, above all, more investment in the new production plant and machinery needed to enable these production quantities to be achieved", Gallagher says.
According to some companies, the ongoing implementation of new production plans and the increase in the building of aircraft are part of the problem.
According to the Executive Director of JJ Chrurchilli, who produces the wings of gas turbines, Andrew Churchill, the company has behind it a "suspecting time" when several new construction plans began to be implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of our eyes, we moved very little production to a situation where production capacity exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and in addition, we had to try to get ahead.
However, it is useful to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans," Mr Churchill says.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing 80 000 pounds in new machinery and hiring 26 new workers.
A number of industry players believe that more investment and coordination between small and medium-sized suppliers is needed if the United Kingdom wants to maintain its position as the second largest operator in the aviation sector after the United States.
Geoff Ford, Chairman of Ford Aerospace, and Tyneside Business Engineer, Geoff Ford, said that the order amount should increase the confidence and desire of producers to expand and increase production capacity, as the work will be sufficient.
"If this doesn't happen, we're going to be in competition against other countries," Ford says.
Other major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, a company that manufactures FTSE 250 aircraft and engine engines, purchased UPECA 75 million pounds to manufacture parts of an aircraft operating in Malaysia.
MB Aerospace last year purchased companies from North America and Poland.
"It is possible to buy new business-creating start-up companies, but in fact the most low production is limited in design and the number of engineers", says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both large and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has shifted from those large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the operators in the production chain are over-reacted.
Marcus Bryson, Director of the GKN Aeroplane Production Unit, also acting as a representative of the British aviation industry, believes that the President of the ADS considers that the production chain has handled the problem better than in previous periods.
There is pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe the situation as critical.
"The introduction of new technology and advanced processes is more important," says Bryson.
Both the Apples and Boeing have learned about the mistakes and are now more important in order not to increase the number of buildings too quickly.
Boeing’s attempt to increase its production in 1997 brought great difficulties when the company lost and the factories and production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, Director of the aircraft manufacturing unit Rolls Royce, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which delivers most of the 18 000 parts required for the engine manufacturing of the jet aircraft.
"You will certainly be confounded, but we believe that we have done more intensive work in the supply chain by selecting the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers when they prepare for more action," Wood says.
According to Boeing's CEO James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in supply costs.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to suppliers, which is very important.
Fabrice Brégier, CEO of Airbus’s passenger jet production unit, says that the company will make every effort to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines per month by 2018.
"There may not be a reporter, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation, to support the suppliers and to look for alternatives, but there are a lot of problems," says Brégier.
Belgium says that Airbus is not looking for scapegoats: "The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the main supplier.
So this is the work of me and Airbus."
The Hong Kong protest groups will begin the "representative period" in Beijing, the open elections in the language of Beijing.
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong.
Democratic activists are spreading to the streets of Hong Kong to abandon China for their open elections requirements.
The groups in support of Hong Kong democracy emphasise that protests can stamp and swear that they will ensure that the town is starting to face the reform of the elections proposed by the Government of China.
Thousands of protestors defied the coming rain against Hong Kong’s glowing horizon as they walked into the demonstration organised by the Occupy Central Group in support of democracy in front of the Council’s bodies responsible for the implementation of the laws on Sunday.
The demonstration only took place hours after Beijing had announced that it will deny the right of voters to propose candidates publicly in the 2017 presidential election, threatening the long-lasting demonstrations of the city that will further increase its two-time expansion.
The speakers participate in the opening of the Occupy Central protest in front of the main government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We will have a fair and fair election," says Dion Tse, a 24-year-old website administrator, who participated in the Sunday protest with his 50-year-old mother, Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect the voice of Hong Kongers.
We would like the government to listen to us and see the Hong Kong people's determination.
The House of the Supreme Laws in the People's Congress of China adopted plans for the elections, which will allow only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, the nomination requires the approval of the 1200-person Nomination Committee, and the opposition politicians believe that this prevents the effective access to the flags of political dissenting candidates.
The speakers participate in the demonstration of the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, which was carried out in Tamar Park in front of the government building in Hong Kong.
According to police estimates, more than 2 600 people are currently involved in the protest.
A large number of police officers followed when some 100 protestors led by the Group of Scholars gathered late on Sunday for Grand Hyatt, where Li Fein, member of the Communist Party, was scheduled to spend the night after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of the Occupy Central, participated in the press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and Federation of Students, among others.
Or, however, the exact date of the road blockage was not stated in the law, but called on the participants to closely monitor developments in the "in the next few weeks", adding that the city is going to be officially "infringemented into a period of time".
Benny or answer the press questions.
"Look at the man next to you," he said in the Sunday demonstration, I stand in front of two advertisements representing disobedience in China.
That man has the center of power with you.
17-year-old convenings representing Schilarism, Joshua Wong said earlier that the preparation of student demonstrations is ongoing and planned at the same time as several university students are expected to agree to refuse to teach.
"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our personal responsibility," Wong says.
In Beijing, the Vice-President of the Committee on National Congress, Li Fei, informed journalists that the defence of the general right to vote for 'international requirements' is 'a waste of time' and originates from some Hong Kong politicians who seek 'to confuse and mislead society'.
"The impractical proposals such as the nomination of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time," Li says, requiring that an election be created in such a way that it fits into the real situation and the legal framework of each society.
A legislative initiative on general voting rights can only be adopted if a large majority, or two-thirds of the 70-person legislative body in Hong Kong, supports this, which means that 27 opposition members of the government can stop the initiative.
He warned that Hong Kong might have to undergo a prolonged political debate if the proposal for a reform was rejected by veto law.
"It would affect business and the development of the city," he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal inquiry organised by Occupy Central in June to oppose the requirements of China. According to the requirements, the candidate needs to be approved by the committee.
Up to 172 000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, while the march against Beijing and the Occupy Central on 17 August attracted some 88 000 participants, estimates from the University of Hong Kong, but estimates by the police and the organisers differ considerably from those figures.
Three injured victims of an impact on the New York beach by a hit and a hit on the New York beach.
In a lightning attack on a New York beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured on the Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay at the Bronx on Sunday night when heavy storms crossed the area.
The injured men are in hospital care.
The extent of injuries is unknown.
The lightning struck when the heavy thunderstorms evaporated over the city.
Storm rains, thunder and lightning interrupted the Labor Day weekend party and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens and forced the music festival to close early on the East River island.
Tens of the commercial flights to the airports of the city were delayed due to bad weather.
The idea of a new idea is not a pleasant idea.
This is the latest guidance provided by network users to employees and managers and is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager website.
According to Entrepreneur Seth Godin, a good idea is to recognize comments such as "I don't like it" or "I don't understand."
Unless this is the case, the idea is probably popular and obvious – therefore boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so limited that it is not worth pursuing.
As an historian, as a Harvard Drew Gilp never repeated anything that had already been published so that people would not think that he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as the headmaster of the university, he will repeat the same thing several times so that the message will be widely sent.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman believes TV and radio are the best tools for creating demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read the news about the network does not mean that the Internet is a good inter-promotion – just like the first phone was a popular communication tool but a bad choice for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson states that there is only one word to motivate workers: together.
One study told participants that they would resolve the problem as cooperation, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room. These participants would work longer and solve more problems than participants who were not told about the cooperation at the beginning.
If the task is to find a successive pattern or relationship between the two entities, attendance expert Dave Paradise advises you to forget Microsoft SmartArt and instead use Chart.com, where you can choose between 14 different relationships.
The floods of the Mount Stuart hospital are banned for safety reasons.
The doctor has been temporarily suspended from office, and the UK National Health System NHS stopped to direct patients to cataracts at that private hospital after the hospital problems were raised.
Two people applied to Torbay Hospital for emergency care in Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Tombay Hospital in Devon has been associated with 19 patients who had been treated on 26 July and invited them to "extraordinary clinical examination".
The Mount Stuart hospital regretted the matter and said that the case had begun to be examined after the doctor had been fired.
It became known to the hospital of Torbay when two patients treated at Mount Stuart applied for first aid due to eye problems.
According to Torbay's hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients, who were examined on the same day, needed surgery.
The Torbay Hospital and the Southern Devon and Torbay Hospital have not directed patients to the treatment of Mount Stuart after experiencing problems.
David Sinclair, the interim director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation leading to Torbay Hospital, said that "we have identified the problem at its beginning and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we guide patients to the care provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider meets the most recent legal requirements and that its licensing matters are in order.
According to Gil Gant, director of patient safety in South Devon and Torbay Hospital, "patient safety is always an absolute priority, so it is important that all post-mortem surgery is not performed as long as we can be absolutely sure that treatment is safe".
The Ramsay - Care UK, managing the Mount Stuart Hospital, asked "to be sincere about all patients who suffered complications".
It was announced that "when we found out about any problem, we and later Torbay Hospital were called to all patients concerned.
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005, and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
So far, he has performed 4 537 post-operative operations in different parts of the organisation, according to statistics, the clinical results of the cuts he has performed have been excellent and the percentage of complications has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor had been temporarily suspended from office until the matter had been examined.
What's "4chan"?
Pamous anonymity of communication website published as the first celebrity leaked numerals.
What exactly is "4chan", and why was it the first option for the hacker to publish images stolen from his publications?
"4chan" was established in 2003. It is a communication site which has been debated and which is called on as much as is praised.
The website is divided into a number of sections, known as bulletins, where anonymous users can discuss all possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create a common, common profile and their publications are not kept.
Comments may disappear less than a minute after the most recent publications remove them from the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchic and surprising creative atmosphere in "4chan".
Members of an anonymous community have created some of the most well-known mechanisms on the network (such as "rickling" and "lolcats"), but the lack of site rules has also resulted in a lot of question or indeed criminal content on the site.
The most popular publication of the website is /b/, which is intended for mixed conversations and regularly presents the NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may include hot porn, but also raw and alarming images. An anonymous hacker published celebrity stolen images just on this bulletin table this weekend.
The American CytRx invests in cancer drugs for research and development.
CytRx aims to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company that produces biological medicines in the USA, which recently became the subject of a trial that led to the sale of shares in power, has specialized in the research and development of anti-cancer medicines.
The most common medicine is aldosorubin, which is a more advanced form of dodosorubin, which is commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx conducts studies with subdosorubicin in the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, AIDS-related Kaposin’s sarcoma and new glioblastoma or brain tumors.
It's like a controlled missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to any other body, says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx, on cancers of the subdosorubies.
Aldosorubin contains so-called unit technology, which acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to a protein in the blood, which also collects into the tumours, resulting in the direct transmission of the medicine into the cell cells.
I agreed to give up the medicine only in an acid environment, i.e. cells, but not healthy tissue.
With this technology, patients can be given more and more cancer medicines at more than one dose.
"It's like a missile that goes directly to the tumor and not to any other body," says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
As is the case with many other biotechnology companies focusing on the development of medicines, CytRx does not make any profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus collected $86 million for operating and research activities.
CytRx is currently looking for 400 patients worldwide for a critical 3-stage clinical trial for alternative treatment for soft tissue disease.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
The potential treatment for cancer is used when the initial treatment does not result in results.
If clinical research is successful, CytRx plans to apply for authorisation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2016, says Kriegsman.
What could then be adopted in 2017.
Analysts say that the information published by CytRx in December on a previous study in the past showed that aldosorubicin was a promising treatment for soft tissue disease.
"The long-term issue was "we have not seen any clinical information on how much it is different from the medicine itself," says Dr. K. Wainwright & Co., an analyst at H.C. Wainwright & Co. investment firm, Har Fein.
The publication of the results confirmed a number of opinions that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says that it is difficult to predict the results and timing of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which produced good results.
"Whatever needs to be done is right," he says.
Fein compares drug development to the mining industry.
"First, a lot of money will be invested in finding that one golden vessel, and the investment will continue so long as that gold vessel is found," he says.
Money will be spent on research and development as long as the medicine is successful in commercial terms.
A number of shareholders have demanded a CytRx company to be right because they think it gave the reality a better picture of its success.
In the appeals, the company is accused of hiring a DreamTeam Group, which then claimed to have hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotech company in Forbes, Seeing Alphan, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet-like articles on the pages of Forbes, Seeking Alpha, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the complaints, the articles did not show that the companies paid the authors commissions.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that it had deleted articles "who were contrary to the practice".
Several company articles were also deleted from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on the allegations.
The company has hired a third-party lawyer to take action against a complaint.
"I don't have time or energy to focus on this," Kriegsman says.
According to him, the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who are generally seeking employment in biotech centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways a desert from the pharmaceutical industry perspective," he says.
View of the Analyst magazine
The price of shares in CytRx rose to $8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than $3 in April when the allegations of advertising of shares were made public.
According to the analysis paper, claims and negative disclosures have decreased below the price of shares than their real value.
"It's unfortunate," Fein says, "but I'm not sure if there's any easy way to ignore this matter as long as the perception is valid.
In the name of the law - the camera of the police series was killed in the middle of a series of descriptions.
The photographer of the event-based series in the name of the Law in Finland died on Tuesday night when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident.
The cameraman described an armed robbery between a suspected person when he was shot by a bullet in an armed robbery between a domestic police force and a fast food restaurant.
He died quickly from the injuries he suffered from.
According to the TMZ website, the police reported that a suspect in an armed robbery, in addition to the cameraman, was killed in an incident.
The series in the name of the Law has been published in the United States since 1989, among the first true TV programmes.
In Finland, the series has been presented on the MTV network since the 1990s.
The question of who is responsible for the murder of Ulvila will play a crucial role in the court hearing which began today.
Arija Aueria is accused of the murder of her husband Jukka S. Lahti in 2006.
The Vaasa court is now dealing with the case for the second time, for the Supreme Court has received that court with a new evidence from the district court.
The court's purpose is that the judgment will be handed over again this year.
The Vaasa court court released Auer in 2011.
In that case, the right considered the possibility of a person who is likely to be involved in the event of a conflict is likely to be the case.
In his opening speech, the Public Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala explained the prosecution of the state's position on the murder of the state's attorney and on the facts which exclude the possibility of the offender.
In our view, the crucial question is whether an external factor who has become a member of the house has been killed by Jukka Lahden Anneli Auer in the manner and time reported by Mrs. Anneli Auer.
This is about the credibility of Anneli Auer's story," K Kulmala said.
According to the D.A.'s office, a family dispute occurred during which Auer had announced that he would leave the home and apply for divorce.
At some point, they moved to the kitchen where Lahti held Auer and tried to prevent this from happening.
One of them took a kitchen knife", Kulmala described on Monday the events of the night of death.
According to the D.A., a number of factors prove that there was no external factor at the scene.
For example, an emergency call does not include any votes on the outsider.
Auer's oldest child - daughter - told me in the interview that she saw the unsub when he left the trunk door.
The release judgment of the Vaasa court in 2011 was partly based on the daughter's report.
According to the D.A., the daughter's testimony cannot be true.
"The daughter didn't see anyone else in the parent's bedroom, even though she visited the parents' bedroom twice to check it out," Kunmala said.
The new witness in the prosecution's office is linked to the possibility of a person who is the opposite.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has reported events in the hospital since the murder.
According to her daughter at the hospital, the only thing she could tell us was that she only saw Lahti's body when she saw her death in the back room.
Auer's defense intends to refer to the court a series of investigations, the proportion of which the police have not been able to find out enough according to the defence.
When Vaasa's court-martial released Auer three years ago, the right to find a strange man's dna in the fish was one of the grounds for the offender.
The sample later proved to be the DNA of the researcher working in the Central Criminal Police Lab.
A DNA sample of 700 people was taken in mass production.
A significant number of serious suspicious and alternative investigations were also excluded," says Advocate General Juha Manner.
Another of the new prosecutors of the defence will tell you about a possible third party factor.
The alien woman told the police about a migrantist regime that, according to a woman's report, had confessed to the act.
The police questioned a man during the summer.
The D.A. ruled that the law enforcement agency had nothing to do with a homicide.
The D.A. made an inquiry into a woman, as the D.A. suspects that she was lying about her story.
Another defense of the new witnesses is the nurse who was working the night of death in the Central Hospital of Satakunta.
The 100th district court condemned Auer's life imprisonment in December last year for the murder of a life sentence.
According to the court judgment, the possibility of an offender is in conflict with, among other things, the reports of the children of Auer, the votes referring to the missing offender and the time required for the action to take.
The vote came in 2-1.
A minority judge wrote that evidence of a conflicting nature in a criminal case must be interpreted as being in the interest of the accused.
Therefore, the story of the daughter must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the explanations of the story, this had been observed by the external author at the door of the exiting fireplace room.
The two oldest children in Auer have been called to court for hearing.
For the first time last year, the girl was heard personally by the district court last year.
As far as the court is concerned, he no longer remembered the events of the night of the murder.
Auer's second oldest child was born to be the killer of his mother during a video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the events of the night of the murder at the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for the past six months.
The man has no obligation to state anything in the court of the month in which he is a lawyer.
The trial will continue today with the consultation of Anneli Auer.
If necessary, the hearing of Auer will take place tomorrow.
Ms. Auer is currently in prison for over seven years for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin be allowed to take part in the G20 meeting?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him many of the first enemy's enemies.
Putin is due to attend the G20 Summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is actively discussing whether or not his entry should be allowed.
The Punkrock activist group Pussy Riot requested Australia this weekend to ban Putin's participation in a summit involving more than 4 000 representatives of the most powerful countries in the world.
"This person has nothing to do with the G20 meeting," said Maria Alyokhina to the general public at the pre-packed opera house in the context of the Festival of Dungerous Ideas event.
Kiova has claimed to be on the brink of "full war", and Putin calls parts of Ukraine "Novorossia" or "New Russia". So is it necessary to welcome him?
Abbottat has said, "I'm so sorry about your decision."
According to Mike Callaghan, head of G20 of the Low Institute Research Centre, the Australians cannot decide who can attend the meeting, even if the meeting is held in the country.
"Astralia may decide who it will let in, but it is an international meeting," she says.
Just as New York hosted UN meetings or Washington hosted meetings of the International Monetary Fund, "the host is not responsible for banning someone from being invited," Callagha says.
In the previous week, Tony Abbott said that he would "twitch your decision" after Russian ominous actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important issue.
Since Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia does not have the right to decide on this matter on its own.
"There is, however, an important matter that I will weigh a lot, and I believe that other countries will also do that in the next few weeks," he says.
People will attend an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, Eastern Ukraine.
The event will take two days and will involve a wide range of representatives of the world’s largest and least-developed economies, with around two-thirds of the world’s population, accounting for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include, among others, Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union and some specifically invited guests from countries not members of the G20, such as New Zealand, Singapore and the West.
According to Callaghan, Australia was challenged by the task of balancing the various interests under great public pressure.
He felt that the prime minister's best way of dealing with the matter was to use the opportunity to press Russia to talk publicly about its recent actions.
"The Prime Minister should say that we intend to use this opportunity in order to pursue a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions."
If Putin comes to the meeting, he has a duty to report on his actions," Callaghan says.
The growth of geopolitical pressure is clearly visible.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
The religious rebels are preparing weapons for an attack on the military base of the Ukraine in the Donetsk border in the East of the Donetsk border.
It remains unclear whether there is a participation in the Puti meeting, and according to Callaghan, this may not be known until a few days in advance.
This will certainly be the last thing in Putin's mind.
He could hardly say that "I need to change my attitude towards Ukraine, because I am determined to go to Brisbane in November.
President-in-Office Bill Shorten views Putin's arrival in Australia as "extendably", but understands that this is an international conference.
Prime and Foreign Ministers are probably the time to discuss with other countries and G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
It's an international, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
Following the tragic events that have followed the Malakan Airlines accident, and in the absence of proper cooperation between pity, sense of responsibility and an accident, fully and now that thousands of Russian soldiers are flocking at the Ukrainian border, I believe that most Australians are very much prepared to welcome Putin to Australia.
The world of the world's world criticises the "selfless" World.
Some of the top Executive Directors of the United States warn that Germany has become "too reliable" and "self-confident" because government policy threatens the competitiveness achieved by the country's pain.
The criticism against the Government of Chancellor Angela Merkel happens at the same time as the major European economy seems to be signs of slowing down, which is worrying about whether it is able to keep economic growth on track in the euro area.
The criticism of the directors is the result of the fierce opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term employed workers in 63 years.
"I believe that the greatest threat right now is excessive confidence in Germany, which inevitably leads to a feeling of self-indulgence," says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world's largest chemical manufacturer, BASF, based on sales figures.
Europe's economy
He says: "Mostly, there is a feeling that we are doing well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level. So what is the problem?"
I think there is a great danger here.
The German Government's policy shows that we are not focusing on growth and we are not a favourable environment for business, but we are focusing rather on a much more distribution of wealth and meeting expectations from certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, Executive Director of BDI of the Organization for Industry, "The situation in Germany is now good.
However, in the next ten years, every developed economy will have to change. ...[in Germany] the reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce DIHK has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
The unemployment rate in Germany has remained low and the budget is well balanced, even once again slowed down consumption is growing again.
However, the fall in the second quarter of GDP has highlighted the vulnerability of export-profit Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP fell by 0.2 per cent over the previous three months from the year before.
The poor performance threatens to make the ECB’s fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make it more likely that a quantitative recovery would occur.
Kerker would like the government to "return public consumption to public investment", for example by focusing future consumption increases on infrastructure and not on pensions.
According to Kerer, the Government of Merkel is destroying the fruit of his social democratic successor Gerhard Schröder in the early 21st century with strict politics.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, Executive Director of Stiftung Familienunternehmen Foundation for Family Enterprises, "Germany's situation is still good compared to other countries.
It is a thank-you to companies, not a government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that spending money on social assistance and restricting the freedom to run a business is the wrong way of doing things.
The leading German investment bank described the situation in a more explicit way, in other words, that the recent decisions taken by the government are "disasters".
The risk of risk of losing everything for which it has worked so much, just to please the voters.
This is my main concern right now," says the banker.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to resolve the fundamental weaknesses of the policy, which have caused the industry to face the disadvantages of its competitiveness.
Ashton Kutcher at the music festival of the handbag music festival at the Ashton Kutcher Music Festival, to prevent security guards from getting to the fan.
Actor Ashton Kutcher took part in the Stagecoach cover music festival in India, California, where he is reported to have been in conflict with a tight security guard.
Ashton Kutcher is reported to have been fighting with a security officer at a country music festival.
The Kutcher fan tried to approach him at a backstage Stagecoach country music festival in California, after which the situation got out of hand, the TMZ site reports.
Kutcher was in VIP facilities when a young woman approached him in order to greet him and shake hands with him.
When the star of the male-semi-series went to greet the fan, the super-industry security guard intervened and created a nude.
An actor and a security guard ran into a handbag, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to hold Kutcher, TMZ says.
Having separated from his ex-wife, Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, the star of the last 70's show like Kutcher.
The Sejakka happened shortly after Angus T. Jones had practically removed the hit series from the standard observer map after he published a video, where he calls the series "bad" and invites fans not to look at it.

The Baltic Sea bacteria were created by a holiday visitor.
Six people have been infected by the bacteria from the Caribbean that come from a popular German tourist destination.
One sick person is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but it is found most in the Gulf of Mexico.
Bacteria spreads most effectively in more than 20 degrees of breakthrough water.
"Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct," Dr. Heiko Will, Director of the Meckleleburg-Vorpommern Agency for Health and Safety (LAGuS) reported to The Local newspaper Heiko Will.
The bacteria are equally found in Denmark, Poland and across the border.
According to LaguS, the sick person had been on holiday on the island of Mondom at the end of July.
He passed away at the beginning of August.
A second pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks and it is possible that his leg will have to be amputated.
He went swimming near the Ahrenshep with a small wound on his leg.
The sick person went to the hospital after he noticed on his way home that his foot had become blue.
Doctors found in the foot that Vibrio vulnificus has caused blood poisoning.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea region if he had known about the danger," Sonja Bruehl, a sick wife, told Ostsee Zeitung about the magazine Ostsee Zeitung.
Serious illness and damage to the patient and his family caused by blood poisoning could have been avoided if information had been better available. For example, the subject of the holiday could have prepared a report on the matter.
LaguS told the DPA news office that doctors have been instructed to follow the infection situation at the beginning of the summer, but no official newsletter was given.
Cold temperatures have led to a lower risk of bacterial disease.
"The test results on [early] showed that the strain of V. vulnificus has decreased significantly", says Dr. Will.
The cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of the cholera causing bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person is already suffering from chronic liver disease and reduced immune response such as HIV or diabetic patients and elderly people.
Men are at greater risk of becoming infected than women because estrogen has been found to be a protective agent.
If the bacteria get sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The risk of death of the bacteria following a wound wound is approximately 25%.
V. v. vulnificus can also become infected by eating marine organisms contaminated by it, although Dr. Will says in this case that this is not the case.
The pollution of marine food products is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, the V. vulnificus disease caused poisoning the last time in 2010, when two people died of it.
Vikänen: Breast removed due to suspicion of cancer.
The 80-year-old singer Vieo Kekkonen performs and practices hard, but has also had to fear for his health.
I can't believe it's been 80 years since the glowing Vieo Kekkonen has been in the middle of 80 years.
He himself is astonished at how all of those years can suddenly be so much.
I don't really realize that I'm this old.
80 years is very much said, Vieo Kekkonen thinks.
Her birthday is Vio Week spending time with her family.
At the end of August, a celebration was held for him by the Association of People's Music and Pensions, at Karttula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on Kekkola stage at the same place my grandfather was born.
I was so embarrassed about the party, the birthday hero tells me about the event where the stage measured for three centuries was full of congratulations.
A few days later, Muhoks met to welcome Armi Kuusela, whose life Vino Kekkonen remembers being followed young.
And now we're both this age.
Violo Kekkonen to the front page of the week.
There are only a few aspects of Vieo Kekkos’ long career that have not been seen in public.
One thing he has never said publicly before: the other breast was removed from him in 2006.
There was an unclear finding under my supervision at a point where it was decided to remove it completely.
At last, it was not a cancer, of course I was sure of.
New breasts were created in the same operation, so it was quite a big operation.
Viennese Kekkonen has not been thought to have lost his own mind in a way that is in vain, for knowledge of the unclear finding would have been a serious position and cannot be ignored.
I was just so relieved that there was nothing serious, Vieo Kekkonen tells me and points out that losing your own chest is certainly more difficult for younger people.

Take a look at the digital magazine here.
The farmer shall be made responsible for the marine status of the farmer.
The debate on the weak state of the Baltic Sea and its link to Finnish agriculture is on average depressing.
The vote of experts has been drowned politically with purposeful opinions.
In addition, during the summer, the Sanomat and Yle in the Sanomat and Yle have contributed to the responsibility of agriculture for food emissions to the Baltic Sea.
Rapid action to control emissions has been required for the same breath.
The average farmer seems to have a few environmental researchers and their contribution to the relevant suppliers compared to the superior food expert.
The farmer knows that the nutrients can't come from cultivation if the field is sown with the same amount of nutrients as the crop will fix it.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires careful monitoring and reporting to be fed.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the field have been washed into water, even after fertilisation standards, but there has been a clear reduction in emissions for years.
Farmers are willing and willing to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
But everyone should understand that zero access is impossible.
"If we want an amount of agricultural production that is about equivalent to consumption, all we have to do is accept that this is the case", says Jyrki Akkukkala, Director of the MTT Environmental Research (MT 29.8.).
Last summer, the Gulf of Finland was brought in by a large number of blue people.
The researchers were quite agreed that the leva received its power from its own phosphorous reserves in the sea.
Phosphorus stored in the sea is partly withdrawn from agriculture in the coastal States over the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The waste water treatment of the growing cities of the Baltic coasts was on the decline from the late 1900s to the end of the century.
The problem also concerns large Helsinki waste water and has not been seen as a problem, as is the pollution of its own beaches.
Coastal pollution was prevented by the construction of waste water pipelines in the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the water quality of the site has improved over the years.
The nutrients that once reached the sea will not pass away even if agriculture is completely discontinued from Finland.
However, any debate and accusations made will always be directed at the agriculture of today's day.
A debate marked the farmer's fault for the state of the Baltic Sea.
The charge is disproportionate, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to carry out personal passions.
The Greens, under the leadership of the Environment Minister Ville Niinäjö, drive major changes in agricultural environmental standards.
As a pop-up platform, Nienistö has been having a summer rest discussion.
It has often been said that the producers' representatives accused the MKK of being advocacy and considered it to be the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be a limit on political rhetoric, too.
Most of the specific projects in the field of water protection are based on cooperation between the JRC, farmers and environmental management.
The ginning style of the Nile serves more to fish for green voice than to protect water.
I think that's what it's supposed to be.
With hard talk, the Greens prepare to leave the government.
In policy changes, the JRC shall be responsible for ensuring the livelihood of its members.
It is difficult to trade expensive changes for farmers unless there is a substitute for their costs.
The money that Ville Niistö has produced is the cuts from other agricultural funds.
Reimbursement of the mine tax will not go through: Palmer
The last attempt of the Abbott government to throw the mining tax into the waste bin seems to be destroyed, as Clive Palmer has announced that his senators will reject it without any change.
The Australian Labour Party is also concerned that the Government has included a rule on a new initiative that could add employers to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government took advantage of a qualified majority in Parliament's lower room on Monday in order to rush through the review process in the power of general confusion and in the face of the clear hatred of the working people.
It put aside the original withdrawal initiative, which was previously subject to significant changes by the Senate, and replaced it with the new draft law, which it described above all related to taxes, pension contributions, social security and family social assistance.
At the beginning, it was an initiative to reverse the "unlucky" mine tax and other decisions, such as the low income pension (USD 3.6 billion savings), the income support bonus (EUR 1.3 billion) and the bonus for children of school age (EUR 4.7 billion).
Clive Palmer, Director of Palmer United Party (PUP) did not approve of the transfer of government.
"The misguided mine tax annulment initiative is not accepted in the Council without the low income pension, the income support bonus and the bonus for school-age children", he said.
The government needs the support of independent parties such as PUP to ensure that the working people and the Greens do not object to the initiative.
Mr Chris Bowen accused the Government of trying to abolish Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory amount of guarantee for pensions, giving the Minister of Finance all powers.
"This is unprecedented," he said to journalists in Canberra.
This would allow the government to delay other increases, in which case the target of 12% of the guarantee amount for occupational pension contributions would be transferred up to 2034.
"It is not acceptable in any way, and the Labour Party will, of course, object in every way", Bowen says.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the finance minister the power to decide to suspend future additions.
A man's body was found on a beach in Brighton.
Sussex's police applied for the body of an unidentified man before two tides in the afternoon, and the police closed down an area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway tourist scene.
The police and the M.E. are working hard to find out where the body went to the beach.
The man has not yet been identified.
Researchers are going through the list of missing persons to find out if missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under dubious circumstances.
According to the police, one death victim was killed in an accidental explosion at the border by an accidental explosion.
According to the Pidras Negras police, an accidental explosion at the customs building at the Mexican-US border probably caused one woman's death and five other people's injuries.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas acts as an operational director of the local police of a city located at the border of Texas.
He told the FFd Press that a woman who died in the Sunday explosion was injured by skull damage and that five others had burns.
According to L Powers, the explosion occurred tomorrow morning in the nightstands of customs officials.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but they believe that there will be an explosion of gases.
The explosion did not affect the border guard.
The three Atlantic City casinos will close in September.
Three Atlantic City casinos close their doors this month.
The main customer will be at the Showboat casino, which is supposed to close its door, Atlantic City, N.J., on 29.7.2014.
September is expected to be a rare month for Atlantic City, when three casinos share their last cards on the table.
Three casinos close their doors this month in Atlantic City, New York State, which means that this neon-lighted metropolis known as the click of money machines can no longer be counted as a game income.
More than 5 000 workers are unemployed when the Showboat and Revel casinos shut down this weekend, the Associated Press office reported.
There will be more unemployed when the Jump Sphere turns its light on.
The expected closure of the three casinos, one of which had only been available for two years, is the latest disaster in the country after the end of the Atlantic Club story only eight months earlier.
By the end of September more than 25% of the city's casino workers, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, written by the New York Times.
When gambling was allowed in New York in 1976, casinos were advertised as a secure choice for a poor economy in Atlantic City, the AP agency writes.
However, the local gambling industry has received a lot more competitors when casinos in New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania block a large proportion of Atlantic City's once so huge casinos.
Even the formerly anti-serious Massachusetts is looking at their part of the money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: It is difficult to accept a new timetable for the future.
According to the Power of Industry (TVO), it is difficult to accept a new assessment by the supplier Areva that Olkiluoto's 3rd reactor is not available for commercial use until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, Director of the Power Plant Project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction works are already largely ready and the number of work in progress is known.
TVO will further extend the assessment of the information received by Areva.
Affirmative notes in the bulletin that TVO welcomes all initiatives to speed up the project.
Areva today submitted an updated schedule for Olkiluto 3 to TVO, according to which 3rd reactor construction works will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could start in 2018.
According to a lively press release, the recent delays in the project were mainly due to the approval of reactor automation systems, which was achieved in April.
For the past four years, negotiations with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been conducted with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for the past four years.
October 3 was supposed to be completed from the beginning of 2009, but the schedule has been delayed one by another.
TVO and Areva have been in dispute for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is raised in an arbitration case in which Areva has claimed compensation of up to EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
On the other hand, TVO considers Areva's claims to be unfounded and requires about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water operators is under way in the face of global challenges.
International leaders met today in Stockholm during the 24th International Water Week, which called on energy and water operators to work together to meet the major challenges of our time to ensure sufficient water and energy production for the growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed to pump, store, transport and clean water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two reserves are also an integral part of sustainable development and should always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, Executive Director of the Stockholm International Water Institute, held the Water Week of the Water Week, said at the opening of the Water Week that "the challenges are huge.
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55 % between 2000 and 2050, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50 % over the next two decades, and this is why closer cooperation between energy and water actors is urgently needed in order to find solutions to allow all the peoples of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, who received the water prize this year, described water as a growth-enhancing basis that both the general public and other sectors need. Briscoe said, "the developing world is facing major challenges.
They must mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that "[the water crisis] does not exist a lasting solution anywhere.
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form the circle.
During a week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation between energy and water operators during over a hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe will receive the Stockholm Water Prize by His Majesty King Charles XVI of Sweden at the ceremony in Stockholm City on Thursday, 4 September.
The Finnish International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research information and provides information to decision-makers so that they can make sound decisions for water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies in Miami: Costs of flying bodies.
In October 2012, the ferry that carried 23 Cuban refugees to Miami fell and 14 people were reported to have died.
The same thing has happened hundreds of years before, and this certainly wasn't the last of its kind.
Every year more than 1 000 Mediterranean migrants die illegally trying to cross the US border.
For the first reason, we are determined to die.
However, it is ironic that when it comes to the first city in the country, it is rare to stay there until its last breath.
For many of these cities, this place is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, an effort board up or a place of entertainment while waiting for a better opportunity.
Hardly imagines dying there, and in the near future, many plan to return to their home country.
In the preferred cities of migrants, the disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily resident in the country lives, and death and return to their country of origin work in their entirety.
It is estimated that 20% of the bodies of the dead in South Florida are flown elsewhere, which is more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (man, the short format of the profession of human remains) are flown to the home country from the Miami International Airport.
Since 1964, according to the CEO of Pierson, the largest company in the sector, approximately 80% of this traffic is going abroad, and the company is flying bodies in several destinations in Central and South America and several European countries.

The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they also die there.
Even after death, there is a cost to return home.
Miami is the main airport of the American Airlines airline for Latin America, and the figures in the table represent the human remains of the airline’s return to its home country in 2013.
The return of bodies to their home country is not cheap: prices can range from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
There is also a range of requirements related to the transport and delivery of human residues in relation to religious, cultural and public health.
In order to help the funeral communities sometimes organised by the preferred urban communities of migrants, it is expensive to return the bodies, the government does not help the process, and the dead are often young people who have no insurance.
Some credit institutions and informal health insurance schemes have once been created by entities founded by the Italian, Jewish and Greek people who lived in New York City – the first groups of migrants in the United States.
The new generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Philippines and Bangladeshi migrants now operate in many of their favorite cities.

Death abroad is always difficult because the person who moved abroad does not plan to make his last rester from the city of the colonial.
In Dubai, without a will in the case of dead foreigners, the Sharia Act is complied with, even if the laws of the deceased's home country differ from those of the deceased's home country.
The entire assets will be frozen, after which they will be distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
Aer Lingus is the network for the transport of human remains of the Aer Lingus (
The scope of 2013 reflects the diverse population structure of the city and of the Irish people.
The airline interrupted the service but resumed it in 2004 after receiving a negative feedback from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present in man’s passing through the preferred city of migrants or in his residence there.
On the contrary, temporary or permanent migration to the city of migration is an open declaration of the way the immigrant looks at life, not death.
However, the death in the city of migration abroad means making the most powerful and irreversible decisions for the immigrant – decisions on whether he wants to belong to a local or global community, a universe or a country, short-term or eternal.
The Centre and the Left will make the interim issue of inequalities between the Centre and the Left.
The opposition parties in the Centre and the Left are going to make an interim issue for the Government on the income of the low incomes and the increase in inequality.
The parties want to stimulate a debate on people's income problems, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
The growing inequality is also reflected between different parts of the country and within large cities, the parties comment on their information.
In the next year’s Government’s budget, cuts and tax increases will, according to the parties, be directed at low incomes such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary workers, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing will continue to increase.
Already nearly half a million people are already unemployed, the parties are informing about their information.
The living-in problems of the working population have also deteriorated.
The Parliamentary Groups of the Centre and the Left Alliance will discuss this matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the basic Finns, has already announced that they would leave an interim question about police and internal security resources.
The parliamentary term of office will begin tomorrow Tuesday.
The New York Public Indian Day parade is about to begin in New York City.
A foreign culture will once again be exposed to light in New York City, where the West India Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and there also politicians will see and see each other.
The annual paradise will be held on Monday in Paradise.
It stirs up the traditional balconies of the Carnival, and part of it is the dancers who wear complex, often made out of feathers.
Eric Adams, president of the Brooklyn region, is the head of the festival this year, but there are also many other well-known faces.
The parade has been an excellent occasion for politicians who are now and who are candidates to welcome the public a week before the pre-elections.
Despite the celebrations, violence has also been heard during the past few years by the end of the parade week.
The police have been told to strive to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including monitoring the activities of the surrounding gangs.
Is it even worth asking rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical issues, don't you?
That question should not be answered.
This grammatical, i.e. a question that is not expected to be answered, but which points to a particular answer, tastes both high-level speeches and everyday exchange of words.
The initial words of Cicron's famous Catilina screening are chain rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, will you use our patience?"
The same applies to my wife's questions: "Why shouldn't I show the kids five days old chicken?"
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for the rhetorical issue.
The power of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that it is open, and the public will accept the question.
The mysterious rhetorical question is to understand that no one in full could agree with it.
In the 19th century, author David Williams described the rhetorical question "to someone who has been assigned words that are admirably designed to produce a strong feeling of the truth about a subject, and at the same time, the challenge they present is impossible to disagree with".
The ability to appeal is the skill of appeal.
Retort questions can be asked afterwards if they are to achieve more ambitious goals.
A number of retort questions, which are intended to express grief or indignantness, are referred to as epic questions.
For example, Job uses them in his appeal to the Almighty: "What do you benefit from being scorned by me -- ?
Do you have eyes like ours?
Do you see yourself in the same way that man sees?
The chain of rhetorical questions is also found in my wife's comments: "Why did you cause food poisoning for children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
There is also a so-called hypofora, which is also the case when you ask a question and answer it yourself immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: "Who is the black private egg that is sexual fear for all women?
It's fun.
That's right. That's right.
Who would sacrifice their lives for their brother?
Another example from my wife is: "What is the only food that children have eaten and where they could get sore?"
This one.
Who the hell fed it to them?
Yeah.
Of course, the rhetorical question does not usually try to persuade, even though rhetoric means the ability to bend.
If you're trying to talk to someone around you instead of trying to preach to those who have already been disfellowshipped or tow someone else's stubbornness, you should use retort questions carefully.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept one's own opinion.
If the public agrees with the argument, "It's not nice when the outside is so bright?", the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure of his claim that it binds the speaker and the public better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is certain that there are no differing opinions.
Assuming that consensus has been reached instead of seeking consensus, the speaker may seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weakness of the argument.
In the headlines of the magazines, the rhetorical question is too often the most clearly possible argument for a very weak case: "Did the alien pyramids build?"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may result in an answer that is different from the suggested answer.
"Do you think what we do?" was part of the British Conservative Party's risky campaign in the general elections in 2005.
The party's out of control.
Some of these cases have become a hobby, and the so-called ‘QTWAIN’ questions (the concept of the British supplier John Relaxoul known as “Quesions To Which Answer Is No,” questions that are not answered) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organised a competition to find the best examples.
The competition was clearly won by "Do You Want Be In My Gang?" who was sang by pop star Gary Glitter before he was exposed to the child's sexual abuse.
The author has also written the book "You Talk to Me"?
Researcher: The time for the federal State Commission may be over.
At the beginning of the conflict in many countries, it was still thought that the federal state could be some kind of compromise to the conflict, said Saari.
President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian channel that the need for peace in Eastern Ukraine is for discussions on the region's state position.
In practice, this means some kind of self-government in the East.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of people living in the East.
The conversion of Ukraine into a state is, according to the island, a priority in a certain way from the objectives pursued by Russia.
Ukraine certainly has reason to doubt that Russia is thereby trying to influence the internal policy of Ukraine, he says.
If no federal decision is reached, another option could, from the point of view of Russia, be some kind of frozen conflict where Russia would control Luhansk and Donetsk in practice, Saari estimates.
The region and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending both weapons and soldiers to the east.
Russia has contested the arguments, even though, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have said that their troops have been fighting "league, voluntary soldiers".
Head of Up: The Powerful Role envisaged for Katainen.
The bricky reminds us that the job description is new and yet to be outlined.
In his view, it is the idea that Katainen in some way coordinated or even led the Commission to work on competitiveness and employment-related matters.
Of course, one of the Commission's priorities for the new period is the Union's competitiveness and employment.
In a sense, at the heart of the Commission's power, Tiilikainen says.
Tiilikainen believes that Katainen's background, economic expertise and role in the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
The idea is that a case should be case-free, which means that Katainen would not be on her own Directorate-General.
On the other hand, Katasta will become a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment field, where she could have other portfolios, not only of the Economic Commission for Europe, but also of other sectors, to be coordinated.
In practice, team management could mean, for example, planning and guidance.
Soldier's mothers: up to 15,000 soldiers in Ukraine.
According to the Russian Soldiers' Mothers Organization, in the past two months, up to 15,000 soldiers have been sent to Ukraine and over 7 000 soldiers are currently in the country.
According to the Human Rights Organisations, at least 200 military soldiers have died.
According to the organisation, the hospital of Rostov, near the border of Ukraine, is sealed in the Ukrainian war by wounded people.
Soldier's mothers collect their data from the soldiers' relatives.
The Military Union NATO has estimated that there are more than a thousand military soldiers in Ukraine.
BB-Andte's use of alcohol is like, "A little bit after a drink comes up".
Big young Jussi and Andte went on Monday evening to consider the life of the BB house.
Jussi, on the basement side, biked on Monday night with Ande, who is part of Kartano's residence.
The two reasoned about what they were doing to the viewers of the program.
Not until you've seen it, Andte said.
In my opinion, most of the time in the BB house is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or tasks form only a fraction of the life of the IB house.
More to the point is being discussed and wondered and discussed and lived and living.
Ande, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday night, the people in the map spent the evening in wet stamps, and the alcohol hit Ande especially on the phone.
Jussi asked Andtel if the party had made a man's life in the house more pleasant now that he had come to talk to these other people in a small horrid way.
I'll have a drink, and then I'll talk to you about it, Andte admitted.
Look at Andte's interview on the ISTV video.
Anna Abreu reveals her body mind in Me Nais.
Anna Abreu tells us in Me Women that she decided to lose weight two years ago when she got off the job.
At that time tired of doing business, Anna thought weight loss would give her more energy.
Montiña / Flash News
Give me a dream a couple of years ago about a body type of the Victoria's Secret model.
My mind was like the Life's Secret model.
Looks good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, Anna tells the paper.
Anna, the student of her body trained in gigs and music videos, says that she is not a covetous trainee, even though she is named as one.
Viha Kytöjoki
In modem, you'll be able to train Anna in the gym and practice boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I get a certain weight at the gym, let me point out.
Sometimes a pop star gives himself permission to use a delicacy.
If I alert you, I'll really alert you.
Sometimes I pull the unhealthy eyes, and I don't wonder if more pounds came in.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
I hate it when I do something bad to my body.
Terhi Supreme.
Let her say she likes her body.
The distribution of profits between companies is a good shareholder but does not increase growth.
Do the directors of Australian stock exchange companies today only try to please a large crowd by granting a larger distribution of profits to the wishes of the shareholders and by buying back their shares?
Is the decision taken by the government of companies to the shareholders that the government is serving?
The profit allocation is the most important one, which was shown last week at the end of the 2014 reporting period.
The prices of shares in companies that have rewarded investors in the form of buy-in schemes and distribution of profits have clearly risen.
That's okay. That's okay.
The reverse side of the coin, however, is that capital consumption will be reduced more than those predicted by the analysts, and this fact will make many wonder whether the short term will be over-emphasised and whether the focus will be on the near future and long-term growth.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance business by other means.
For example, more procurement is purchased at low-cost stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this makes sense because the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
Although the assets acquired from the market are not taken into account, it is clear, however, that the first priority is that the company spends less money on investment.
The net result of the wave of these purchase programmes (and the withdrawal of profit investment plans) is a decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this period "the period of the capital bill", during which companies have tried all they can to keep the amount of shares small.
As part of the same plan, companies increasingly have less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the take-back programmes was EUR 3.7 billion and the value of the expected acquisitions of non-life capital was EUR 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to consider the consumption of capital as a bright part of a report title.
Although we now have figures that confirm that this trend exists, informal evidence has existed for months.
Glenn Stevens, Governor of the Central Bank of Australia, considered it sufficient to point out a few months ago that companies need a little more "combatment" to invest in investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future of individual companies, but about the overall impact of the economy, because the slow consumption of capital generally leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credits from Suisse say that "reporting companies' own estimates of their capital consumption have decreased by an average of four years over the previous two years.
The estimates of free cash flow are averaged at 2 %.
Improving cash flow increases the consumption of equity capital.
This quick look has a good effect on current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some evidence of corporate obedience.
If I received a coin every time the CEO said that the price of the share for a short period of time would not matter, I would... well, the end of the sentence would be easy to guess.
Of course, this argument is not true.
The CEOs follow very closely the price of shares and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short and long-term bonus packages of the CEOs will be determined according to the value of the shares, and the role of the directors will depend on it.
The Executive Directors want to say that some decisions (regardless of whether they are trades, increased investment in an organisation or profit-sharing) may not always be immediately popular, but they are useful for the medium-term strategy.
In fact, CEOs often complain about the fact that there is a very short-term view of the investment market.
Therefore, the current tree of conservativeism seems to be accepting short-term objectives.
However, it was too clear during the reporting period just before the end that the weight was to reduce the consumption of future capital, and the most sustainable companies were praised.
Large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held the first and second share capital in the decline in consumption, but also many other companies did the same – part of the obligation and part of the fear of the reaction of shareholders.
Why, then, do investors push companies to share profits?
According to Hasan Tevfik, the Director of Credit Suisse, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other, most of the fixed-profit investment products have been reduced by the sudden fall in interest rates by central banks worldwide to obtain more money on the market.
These investors are forced to look for profits on the capital market, and they are pushing companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit allocation is uncertain.
Investors would prefer money as soon as more investors approach the retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profits is influenced by a lot of corporate turnover and not by the increase in turnover.
The leaks of public nuisances appear to be from the search for information or from the entry into the e-mail account.
According to Jennifer Lawrence's pictures and some sources, the unknown hacker who leaked videos on the internet amazes information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published the lists of people in the media in one chatroom and said that he had more pictures of women, some of them have reported that their images are fake, while others have said that they were images removed a long time ago.
There are a lot of images, and it's been reported to include, for example, Lawrence, McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upto and the American actor Mary E Mestead.
After hacking, the biggest question is what caused the attack.
Were those pictures and videos real and where they were downloaded from?
The most recent source of the image — a disgraceful and thorough attack on the Apple iCloud service — is unlikely to be an alternative.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in the IT security teams working inside the house, which are designed to attempt to penetrate the company’s own systems regularly.
"Big scale hacking into the ICloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim is true," notes Rik Ferguson, Vice-President of the Information Security Research Unit of Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these hacks (and hacks on less famous people every day) is an e-mail address and a password leak, either by guessing or picturing information, i.e. by fascinating the person to log in with his information to a genuine-looking site, after which this information is used against them.
Continues to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used on iPhone phones to record settings and, above all, on image backup when they are transferred to the cloud server.
You can login to your user account at iCloud by allowing this email address and password, after which your photos and other information can be downloaded from your account.
This can only be prevented if the account holder has introduced a two-step identification ("two-factor authentication", 2FA"), i.e. additional protection against entry into the account when the code is sent to the owner's mobile phone before the account can be logged in.
However, it is rare to use a 2FA feature, either because it is unknown or because it is considered cumbersome.
He will continue to examine whether all information comes from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely the users' accounts were accessed.
The Agency has not delivered an opinion on the matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
He considers it possible that the hacker has used the "Forgotten Password" link in the Apple iCloud service by first collecting the e-mail addresses of the public persons, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that celebrities have used the same password in a number of services when passwords were captured through them.
The author of Lawrence's pictures claims that the pictures are genuine, but does not tell us when they were taken.
Winstead said in his tweed that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These pictures were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took a terrible effort.
I have a feeling for everyone else who is involved in hacking," he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent IT expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought he had removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from the modern smartphone does not necessarily mean that the image is not copyable.
Modern smartphones record images on a regular basis in the cloud service, as they often do not have enough space for a large number of images taken by the user.
Apple iPhone’s standard setting is to store images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and images stored by Microsoft’s Windows phones to OneTrive.
Independent service providers, such as Dropbox, offer automatic images and data storage services.
"Man takes and disengages the image, but they don't realize that the image is being downloaded from an account," Cluley says to The Guardian.
He agrees: "The deleted does not always mean to be deleted," he says.
Photos and videos can be preserved for years.
If someone can access the user's email address and password, they can reload all images and videos sent by e-mail.
Apple's service images can be downloaded to a Mac machine, Windows PC, or any other Apple device.
The hacker created a screenshot, which was claimed to reveal videos and images taken from Windows PC, so far as unpublished videos and images from Windows PC.
Two-step identification protects against such hacking, as it requires anyone who tries to copy an existing account to another device, to enter the original user device, usually a code sent to a mobile phone.
The code will be prevented from entering an account.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo provide a two-step identification to the account, but it is not yet known whether those public entities used the service or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the images they claim to be in are not genuine.
Ariana Grande's representative has said that the pictures in which Grande is alleged to be a "full fake" are "completely faked".
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweed: "I'm the one who's seen nudity, you don't understand.
Let me break the roots from the rumors immediately at the beginning.
Cluley brings up another option.
Due to the fact that the hack was targeted by the public, someone who handled their social media accounts or who regularly e-mailed them to their accounts may have been injured.
"I would like to know whether the actors' agencies or a representative are relevant to the matter," he wonders.
However, the public authorities concerned do not use one public authority or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed or helped in the configuration of one or more systems of the victim of the security attack and changed the secret system so that all information can be recovered.
This was the case in the case of the Florida Christher Coney, who received the name "Hollywood Hacker", where the hacker spread photos from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis' e-mail accounts in 2011 and was sentenced to a ten-year imprisonment in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of intruding over 50 people in the entertainment industry to e-mail accounts in secret between November 2010 and October 2011. In some cases, he asked Aguilera for images of the star in the name of this stylist in a low dress and then published the images online.
Channey then apologized for the fact that what he did was certainly one of the worst privacy violations you can imagine.
Caney was also claimed to have been spyed on two people online for more than ten years.
Cluley says, "In the case of chaney, the star e-mail accounts were hacked and changed so that someone sent their information forward even after the password was changed.
Cluley says that the obsession of hackers who break into these accounts "remembers the collection of butterflys.
They just want to collect this information.
In this case, it is possible that someone had come across the data and log-in information of these accounts on the list of services such as Dropbox.
The hackers may also have tried to penetrate for a long time.
or they could access an e-mail account, such as the address book, and then fished for other persons' information.
I don't think it's another iCloud security hole.
Australia has provided its intelligence service to help the UN track 44 peacekeepers kidnapped by terrorists associated with al-Qaida in Syria.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusran is believed to have 44 Fijian peacekeepers in custody, who were captured last week by that terrorist group at the crossing point at the top of Golan and forced UN forces to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday, and their origins are not known.
At the same time, ministers taking part in the United Nations conference of the developing islands, including the Australian Foreign Minister, Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon at the summit, and he has provided Australia with assistance in order to save the lost peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the United Nations in any way possible, including by providing intelligence assistance," he said to the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We are very closely connected with all intelligence network co-operators and friends -- to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already convinced Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabole that Australia will be using its position in the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
At the same time, the Philippines Peacekeeper Team held captive in its army was reported to have escaped from different parts of the same controversial territory.

Swindlers are trying to steal your money by means of an initiative to abolish the carbon duty, warning the Australian competition authority ACCC.
Swindlers use the anti-tax elimination initiative to steal money, ACCC warns.
The Authority’s SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and companies to trust the government agencies to offer too good hearing offers offering thousands of dollars of credit.
Swindlers may use the figures seen in the media to prove to the consumer how much he can save in buying goods after the carbon tax has been abolished and offering up to $7,000, the warning says.
Swindlers may seem very convincing because they have found out the victim's personal information that they are using in an attempt to obtain bank information or in an attempt to obtain the victim's remuneration.
They're going to talk about topical issues to fool the victim.
Swindlers use more than carbon tax evasion to gain access to money, and their stories are more sophisticated, and they take advantage of timely things to build a scam around them.
Also, MH370 lost aircraft and the death of Robin Williams have been inspired by frauds by the MH370 flight of Malaysia Airlines.
ACCC instructs the company to contact by means of self-established contacts instead of contacting the caller, if there is any doubt as to the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or an email from someone who claims to represent a government agency or company, such as an energy company, and that you are entitled to compensation for the repeal of the tax, beware.
If you believe that you are fooled and that you have provided personal information or that you have transferred money to a fraud account, please contact your bank immediately.
If it's too good to be true – for example, the free money shared by the government – it's probably that way.
Economic Posts: Lipponen motivates the EU's Russian sanctions against Russia.
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the EU's sanctions for Russia in interviewing economics vessels.
The priority policy is to pursue its own interests.
The sanctions may not be effective for this," Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started work to solve the business of the Arctic regions of the EC Confederation of the Economic and Social Committee.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) interrupted Russia's project financing as part of EU economic sanctions.
"This means, for example, that environmental projects with clear prospects in the Northern Dimension go to ice," Lipponen says in an interview.
The freezing of funds is now hampering cooperation, which, according to Lipponen, may be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in the cooperation projects in the Arctic region will continue to be as large as before.
He is currently reporting to the EK on Finland’s Arctic policy and opportunities for businesses in the north.
It does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The report is going forward, let's talk about ten years," he says.
It is rare for the norm to enter a low water or near the settlement, to be determined by the nature teacher Vesa Heinonen from the Lecture Centre of the Museum of the North Sea.
In Vaasa Suvilahti on Sunday, a pole was seen wandering near the beach.
According to the Hein, the button is likely to have arrived in the summer bay after food.
It's not a mess.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's torch.
According to him, for example, on the Sundom Bridge, we will see especially spring and autumn noxes that arrive right after the fish.
The pole is still not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Region.
On land we see the norm in the villas' restaurants, he continues.
The Norppia lives, among others, in the Gulf Sea and the Saarst Sea.
According to the South Australian Court of Justice, the pizza owner Robert Vallelonga, who was murdered, was aggressively and violently acting outside the night club.
Murdered in the south of Austria by a pizza owner, Robert Vallellega.
In the hearing with the Court of Justice, it has become clear that the pizzeria owner Robert Vallelonga acted aggressively against both his wife and security only minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers who accused the court of the death of the Valelonga asked the lower court of Adelaide to release their customers against guarantees because it was "clearly" self-defence.
Marie, QC, said that the case is not sufficiently serious to keep her client, whose identity has not been disclosed, until the trial has taken place.
"According to evidence, the deceased was so aggressive that he had to be removed from the nightclub," he said.
After that, there began to be a dove, resulting in that 40-year-old drunk man -- tearing up a security shirt.
It is important to note that according to the D.A.'s office, death resulted in one wound, which clearly refers to self-defence or other defence.
A 25-year-old man is currently charged with murder only.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection between Rundle St and Synagogue Place on 4 May, about 2.25 p.m., with severe head injuries.
He died of injuries in the Royal Hospital of Adelaide early the next day, and friends and pizzeria customers were hit by One Tree Hill's "local site".
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder of the accused, and after the incident, he had said to the taxi driver "to put someone to bed for a few days."
But the video of the security camera is now proving something else, says Greta.
"It confirms the aggressive behaviour of the dead -- his partner tried to calm him down and gained a share of his hard and violent behavior," he says.
Our client's side is both the assumption of innocence and the proof that he defended himself, which will be brought to the country of trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of a man because of the fact that only one of the three security officers on the ground had been missing from the use of Vallelonga.
According to them, other security guards did not think he was a threat, because "he was short", and he used a big man's vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical interaction.
They said that the taxi driver, who clearly saw the case, also proved that Vallellonga was hit "extremely" and that he had no chance of defending himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered a man to be held until the next week in which he would issue his rulings.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan - quite rightly as a tradition - the foreign news - Evening Sanomat
Bad weather was expected to be delayed in the world at the very beginning of the blasphemy hunt.
The Japanese town of Taiji again started the annual dolphin hunting season on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
Among other things, British Guardians report a great deal of resistance to yachts that have been caught around the world.
In the hunt, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote bay pit where mammals are slaughtered after being selected among the most suitable individuals for transporting dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The meat of the dolphins also ends for food.
According to the authorities, however, the beginning of the hunting was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
The information on the survey spread to the world in 2009 as a result of the documentary The Cove on the subject.
During the previous hunting seasons, hunters have been criticized by diplomas, not only by those responsible for the protection of animals but also by those responsible for diplomas.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat in any case has a limited market because of its high mercury content.
Hunting defenders, including the Government of Japan, claim that this is a tradition.
The defenders have also reminded us that dolphins are not at risk.
In several countries, protests against the Delphin hunt were already carried out during the weekend by protests.
Tokyo, according to protests, the hunt damages Japan’s reputation in the world.
There was also a demonstration in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
The NATO Member States are uncertain about the location of new troops in Eastern Europe.
A military alliance within NATO is divided into views on whether to establish NATO bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have asked the military to bring in permanent troops, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed the plan.
"He has given a new perspective to Russia's policy and is threatening to bring down European security," said Michael Clarke Financial Times, Director of the London Royal United Services Institute.
The NATO Member States will meet at the beginning of the week, and the military alliance is scheduled to publish its new contingency plans.
The main question is whether Nato could break the TAE Agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
There are NATO and Warsaw alliances agreeing how they will place arms in the Atlantic-Ural Mountains area.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and in the Baltic States from being used by the Financial Times.
Russia frozen its own participation in the Treaty in 2007, but the country did not really lose sight of the agreement.
Due to Ukraine's increased situation, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
"There must be natural resources in all NATO countries that need resources," said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, President of the UK Security Committee, to the Financial Times.
Matt Guthmmiller, the youngest ever to fly around the world.
When other teenagers learned to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
From 19 years of age Guthmiller became the youngest ever to fly around the world – and even alone, the CBS News correspondent Carter Evans reported that he had been married to the world.
Young people living in the state of South Dakota flew 30 000 miles to a stop 23 times in 15 different countries in five different continents.
On their way to Guthmiller, they treated him like a rock star because of their record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
"Too risky" and "A spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a lot of the world and have fun."
Guthmiller did not have much to say to those who made such comments.
Of course, I had a lot of fun, but it also included a lot of work, and I hope that, with my record, I will also inspire other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's take-off began at an early age, first of all he asked his parents to have dinner at the airports cafes.
Later on, he wants to go to air classes.
My parents let me in on a short 20-dollar, 20-minute-long, 20-minute-long flight, but I think they thought it would stop.
No, I didn't.
Guthmiller soon thereafter concluded an agreement with his parents to allow him to gain more time in the control room.
I agreed to share a car with my father throughout high school instead of getting my own car.
In a trade trade, I could fly aircraft.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had received a flight licence and two years later he leased a single-engine Beechcraft plane for a single flight around the world.
A young man studying at MIT University self-maintenanced the aircraft maintenance and made fuel calculations.
How many hours at the top, it also meant that he himself needed an additional truck –
a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says that he has eaten a few inventions completely during a long flight.
Flying the clouds was both cool and scary.
In other countries, air traffic controllers did not have an adjustment to help them navigate around the storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just slightly above the plane and which of them reached 45,000 feet high and torn the plane into pieces.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurised and had no oxygen reserves, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The fuel volume of the machine would not have been higher than that of the machine.
On the day after the interview another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Sulleman, died of his plane falling on a flight between Samo and Hawaii, which Guthmiller invites to the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Sullema, and he feels that the take-off is technically challenging due to the high fuel required for 16 hours of flight.
However, despite the danger and even the high place, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for IT training through the Code.org website.
He is a self-employed person and founded his own company at the age of 12 years.
The objectives of Guthmiller are here in the sky.
I mean, I know it'd be the next Apple, but let's see what happens.
In any case, Guthmiller will aim high.
Aim the sky and you can achieve something great.
It's harder to find the right Franchere Entrepreneur than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited to run fans into her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores all over Canada after Canada's W-television started to show The Cupcake Girls' true-to-tv program in 2009.
The enthusiasm continued until it became clear that one Franchise company was not suitable for the task.
"My French company sat in his car and called me that 100 potential customers are waiting outside the store to buy a cake, and he can't handle the situation," Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost possibility for us.
After the incident, Joyce decided to change the selection process for the Franchise partner, from the start of the selection process, to focus on the company’s management skills in relation to culture instead of the skills of bakery.
"Everyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear", he says, adding that he has held about a hundred interviews for each 11 French movements.
We start six weeks of sustainable training, but the workers work in a completely different working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult, and that is why we focus on the appropriateness of education to the business culture.
Finding the right Franchise Entrepreneur is vital for the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to shape and grow an organisation, while a poor performance director can cause expensive damage to the company.
"I thought it would be like dating a Franchise entrepreneur, but it's not at all true, you can do a lot to get to know someone before you get married," Joyce says.
On the other hand, in the case of a Francheise partner, an agreement is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new store is being built.
Partnering with someone before you can see how a person works is a huge step and a major test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchisi parties is a strong marriage, for they share common goals, explanatory by Lorraine McLachlan, Chairman and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
That is why McLachlan believes that the Franchise company should also be careful in choosing a future Franchise donor before taking such a long-term partnership.
"This is the same thing as human relationships: if a date partner is rude on a date already, imagine what he's like in a marriage?" he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose carefully and to assess the future partner and to pay attention to the smallest alerts on either side.
McLaxla adds that French donors such as Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, those acting as a Franchise donor must be more careful in choosing the first, most important partners.
On the other hand, new French donors must determine, on the basis of a supposed successful parent company, what challenges they have faced and what skills a new French entrepreneur needs when facing similar difficulties.
Companies acting as French donors for the first time may also request the help of the Franchis-Adviser to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also points out that for the first time as Franchine donors and entrepreneurs, there is much help available on the CFA website at lokforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will become easier later, as Franchise donors learn how to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first Franchise companies can provide advice and assist in the evaluation.
"The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (founder and CEO of Scurdamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) to create this business and to create a French system," says Erik Church, Managing Director of O2E Brands. O2E Brands includes companies such as 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Daypainting.
Franchise companies helped Brian create something that he could not have created alone, so the first Franchise companies must choose this idea in mind.
There is a 216 Franchise company that represents all three brands of O2E, and he is also a Franchise partner of You Move Me in Toronto.
Chruch's method of finding the right Franchise partner is simple.
"A special test of confidence for us is to ask myself, 'Do I call this person to me for a weekend party?" he says.
"If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend much of your working day looking with them for solutions to major company challenges."
Fran further points out that O2E Brands is to a large extent a thank-you for its Francheise-building successfully.
Business leaders often find their position on a short-term and lower-level basis, while Franchise companies engage in a partnership with long-term goals and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
"The Franchise partnership has many more benefits than traditional corporate structures, but it is also much more intensive," he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
The partnership is more difficult, but well-managed, it produces better results.
In the north of the United States, the prices of cereals are reduced by railway delays.
Late transport by train has led to a significant fall in the prices of cereals in the north of the United States in the middle of weeks before an enormous harvest is expected to be put under new pressure from the transport network.
Commercial cereals in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 from bushesi - about a dollar less than the price of control - as the primary reason for the cost of ensuring the capacity of the routes to be received, traders and agricultural organisations say so.
In raw materials
The problems are the most acute on the BNSF railways of Warren Buffet Berkshire Hathaway and the Canadian Pacific railway company.
The Federal Railway Supervisor will hold a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
In the north of the plains there is a need to resort to the railways in the transport of agricultural products because they are far from the river networks.
The delay in train transport increased as a result of the very cold winter of 2013 resulting in the slowdown and shifting of trains.
Some farmers believe that the increased transport of oil by North Dakota’s Bakken oil industry has rejected the transport of cereals, which is not true according to the railway companies.
According to a manager of an international cereal trading company, the costs of suppliers of grain storage and transporting sellers for ensuring the operation of the train have risen from zero to between $2 000 and 3 000 a year.
Someone has to pay the costs.
"These costs are payable either by the farmer or by the customer," says the director of the grain business.
The United States Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota’s soya bean seed is growing by over a third and that the 16 per cent of the spring crop is growing.
Randy Gordon, Chairman of the National Grain and Feed Association of the National Organisation for Cereals and Feed, says: "We are normally trying to start a new harvest from a clean table, i.e. the harvest has been filled with sufficient storage and the grain has been sold and transferred.
However, we are now starting late due to the service problems of trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this harvest in a smooth manner.
John Miller, vice-president of BNSF, said that the company has reduced the amount of long-term transport (trains ordered by customers, which have taken more than four days to deliver) from the silicone at the beginning of April, 16 500, to about two thousand.
"We've moved almost all the old crops we were going to move", says Miller, referring to the remaining grain from the previous harvest.
However, the latest reported speeds of BNSF grain trains were 9 per cent higher than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that development is "uneven" but pointed out that the company is currently investing USD 5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the processing capacity of all kinds of transportable products, such as cereals.
The trains of the Canadian Pacific railway company, which suffered from the problem, are 11 per cent higher than in the same time last year, but clearly higher than in the first year at much lower speeds.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has informed the Railway Supervisor (Surface Transport Board) that the changes made to its train charter system should improve its ability to handle transport in the 15 to 15 years of harvest.
"The action plan for the autumn of the Canadian Pacific railway company focuses on continuous improvement of train speed and efficient train use, so that we can provide more and more train wagons every week," said the representative of the railway company.
The Ukrainian crisis could solve the "identity crisis" in NATO.
Major country leaders, diplomats and experts have often expressed concern about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO's Afghanistan mission will also end with NATO itself.
However, this concern is very premature, as shown by the NATO Summit in Cardiff in Wales this week, involving 60 leaders, including President Barack Obama.
The mandate of politicians and diplomats is not short of the world's crisis, even to the extent that the exodus of the Afghan forces, which was formerly a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
On the other hand, 28 States are required to re-engage Russia into Ukraine, which is a shocking reminder that Europe's independence is not necessarily just part of the past.
The presidents will seek new ways of punishing Russia, but they will also transfer troops, promise more money for defence expenditure and re-commitment to defence cooperation.
In any case, NATO is grateful for Vladimir Putini.
"It (it) sought for its purpose in some way -- and it had a rather significant identity crisis", says Heather Conley, Head of the European Programme for the Center for Science and International Studies, which operates in Washington.
It is not only that Europe has created a new purpose, but that it is also strengthened.
The item has also added a new task to the agenda.
The President of the United States has pledged to try to get world leaders to create a joint strategy to quickly favour the defeat of the reachable Intangible State militias in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face major challenges in trying to inspire their tired partners in the war to respond to a military response, especially to one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to come up with a strategy to overcome extremists, first of all discovering that "we have no strategy".
Western experts have put forward to the summit cautious expectations as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved in discussion between Ukraine or the Intergovernmental State.
Agri-economic sanctions are designed to serve as the main instrument for the event called the attack on Ukraine by Russia.
The European Union officials discussed this issue this weekend, but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
The US officials pointed out that the countries from which Obama wishes the main partners in an Islamic problem were not necessarily members of NATO.
The accumulation of problems could not be predicted two years ago when the last NATO summit was held in Chicago, where the discussion was held between soldiers and Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Director Robert M. Gates used his last speech to say that the organisation has almost reached the point of "common mutual significance".
The public officials chose to ensure that other countries were not able to reach their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to use 2% of their GDP for defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, the United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this target last year.
However, the officials of the White House now state that they have noticed a change of heart.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement at Cardiff to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The White House found that this time there is a genuine desire for Member States to see the potential threats to their real size.
Following Russia's invasion with Ukraine, the Union's "defence promises are more important and more important than ever after the end of the Cold War", says Charles Kupchan, President of the United States Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach a consensus between the 28 Member States.
Obama will spend most of its journey to strengthen its commitment to defence cooperation in behalf of the developing countries concerned.
The President will begin his three-day journey with a long-term visit to Tallinn, Estonia, where he will meet the leaders of both Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has been using its troops in Estonia since Russia joined Ukraine's Crimean country this year, and NATO troops will be recycled regularly in Estonia when the new contingency plan, which will be revised this week, will be put in place.
The purpose of the plan is to reduce the time NATO needs to respond to attacks in the border region, officials say.
The plan is to increase air surveillance and other visible defences.
The changes present a small risk for NATO, which abstained from setting up permanent bases for the kindness of Eastern and Central Europe as a demonstration of Russia's presence in the area of friendship with Eastern and Central Europe.
According to the officials, the new plan is not actually a crime agreement, but it may also be just a semantic difference, says a British diplomat who did not want his name to be made public in the course of the discussions before the official information was given.
The presence of NATO is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Is Putin a powerful "Valviase" that he uses in Ukraine?
President Vladimir Putin has one ace in his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
The Nordic countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putinia of arming the Eastern rebels and sending the Russian troops to Ukraine.
For this reason, Russia has been subject to sanctions since then.
Once the situation in Ukraine has tightened up, the Nordic countries are planning more severe sanctions against Russia.
However, Russia has a card: winter is coming, and Ukraine's main energy source is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40 %) and coal (28 %), Geysar Gurbanov, based at Harvard University, writes according to Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine in the next four months and coal mines are located in the eastern part of the conflict, the Ukrainians will freeze to their homes when the gas supply from Russia will go down.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, the Russia's energy abandonment, it will help Putin to win the war in the end, Gurbanov will write.
Last year half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
On 16 July, on account of unpaid invoices, the Russians cut off supplies of gas to Ukraine.
Earlier this month, Gazprom reported that Ukraine's debt of gas totalled EUR 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I don't think anyone thinks about it (winter) anymore, except for Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to help resolve this issue.
the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to supplement stocks, necessary repairs must be made and a cold season reserved for the replacement of stocks.
Business ID says that Putin's comment can be interpreted as a disguised threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not bow before the separatists, Moscow may use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman, Japanese holding company Nomura, pointed out last month that Russia's talks about humanitarian interference and the planning of a possible new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will become stronger in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already been notified that Ukraine will have to pay in advance for future gas supplies unless Kiova starts to pay the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement allowing gas imports to continue temporarily.
Last week Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseni Yatsenjuk said that Russia is planning to suspend gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Later, the Russian Minister of Energy Aleksandr Novak told us that the speeches were imprecise.
According to him, Russia is doing everything possible to obtain gas supplied to EU countries.
The protagonist was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ten attacks.
The Saudi Arabian Court of Justice has maintained the ten-year imprisonment sentence in May for Raif Badaw, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement.
It includes additional penalties and fines of a million rst (about 200 000 euros) per year.
The argument was based on the fact that he had set up an Islamic despicable website.
On Monday, Suad al-Shamari, the co-founder of the organisation, informed AFP that he was the co-founder of the organisation.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was already sentenced to seven years in prison in July 2013 and 600 attacks, but the judgment was appealed and returned to office.
The judgment was also appealed in May, when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madvendusts Riku Ranta's humanity experience in Afghanistan: "It was one of the revolutionary human beings".
Madventures today published a new book entitled World Explanation - Adventures’ Explanation of All Things.
We asked Riku Ratal about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish cultures.
Rice also tells of life’s most beautiful human life.
Author, reporter, Madventures' other side of the Riku Beach is a busy man.
A new book has been published today, there was a filmmaker at the Office yesterday and the second production period of Ylelle Docventures will begin on Wednesday.
Ever since yesterday, he's been running from place to place.
The farmer's morning TV to take the child to the day home and from there to a weekly meeting.
The most attractive interview scheduled must be transferred to the telephone interview.
That's all you have to do.
He and Madventures have had time to stop and write a World Explanation book, which, according to the cover of the book, is an adventurer's handbook for everything.
Everything, huh?
Oh, that's a lot of promises.
The book discusses a number of themes, such as what is in our future, why the other culture is worse than the other one, why we are here and who we really are.
We took advantage of interviews we've been doing over the years.
In the book, experts are both professors and artists.
We actively work on the book for about a year, Riku will tell IS by phone.
I've found a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the key message of the work?
The fact that you need to know more about the world and you need to ask yourself big questions, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book Iis is a good travel reader, but it is also meant to make people talk and share ideas at home.
The process can even lead to action, Riku says.
HOW TO STORE: Like Aarre-Ahtito
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What does it look like?
We reached the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the present state of the earth, it must be believed that at some point we will be making solutions to improve our situation.
The world is a kind of an alcoholic.
At first it should admit that we have a problem, but only then can a change take place, Riku philosopher.
Riku tells us that according to some studies Western mankind has reached the peak of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then, prosperity has not increased our happiness.
From this it can be concluded that when enough money is available and our basic needs are met, we are happy.
Money is no more happiness.
Indeed, the desire to encourage people to discuss what is sufficient.
The exploitation of our natural resources will not be enough of this process for much longer, Riku says.
You will also consider cultural differences in your book.
How does an Indian person differ from a Finnish person?
People do not differ much from each other.
Of course, the starting points for education, health and hygiene are different, for example.
The biggest difference between the culturally important difference is that the Community's role is much bigger in Asia, as well as in bad.
Once the Western countries are prosperous, people will live more alone than they do.
Let's get out of memory and it may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
If we found a proper balance between community and alone, we'd be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
Rice has faced many different people in the world.
What kind of culture best fades into his mind?
It is based on my childhood when I was with my family on the first major trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan in my father’s work there in the United Nations.
I was 7 years old and two of my younger sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku bottoming up.
In Finland, a large mobile car came to Finland.
We were driving a war in Afghanistan when there were a huge number of refugees on the roads.
On the road walked a girl my age carrying her little brother on her lap.
I was sitting on a big seabed bench in my coccan hand.
Our eyes met, Riku describes it.
Oh, my God, that's a boy of your age. You know what I mean.
It was one of the changing human beings that I will always remember.
KÖSKELA: KÖSKELA
Riku and Tunna in 2013 at the book fair.
Then Riku "go to the Chapel" that other people must be respected, even if they are much poorer or if they do not have the same conditions of life as ours.
Riku realized at the time that money could not be a meter of human dignity.
From the memory of the adults, people who come up in New Guinea will rise to the surface.
I couldn't stop wondering how people live in the world traditionally.
They use natural materials for all they use, not much money or metal tools.
They live in a very challenging living environment.
Surviving is really hard.
That's what made me think.
And think about him wanting to have a new book with Tunta, including the readers.
The idea is that our book will inspire people to read, watch and listen more.
That it would cause people to act from warm-hearted to jogging to conversation or even to a fist fight, Riku throws away.
The Kahahaikoki newspaper reports on this issue.
The events started when a couple arrived by bus to the station and ordered a taxi.
When the taxi went off, the man in the yard threw an object behind the cab.
The driver got out of the car and the man who was the passenger.
The outside man stabbed the male traveler life-threateningly in his head and in his hand and left the place.
The staff member is a tannery, short-haired man of a length of 170-1 cents.
According to the magazine, there has been a young, light ponytail woman near the site.
I wish I could contact the police.
The police will also ask for guidance from all those who may have detected events or persons involved in the case.
The stab wound occurred on Wednesday 27 August at 7.50 p.m.
"Moi!" said brain to brain - the world's first " transatlantic" message passed through the Internet.
Science release PLOS OneE has published an article that says that the international group of researchers has been the first to be able to convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were "hoha" and "ciao" via the system, i.e. "so" in Spanish and Italian.
In the experiment, the electro-circuit of the person responsible for the transmission was observed.
The broadcaster was trained by the program to send bits to either hand or leg movement by means of thinking.
The representation of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands as one.
This bit-coded information was sent online to the host person.
The recipient was caused by magnetic stimulation of the light source for each piece of bit copied into one.
The recipient was trained to interpret the flashes as a message.
Researchers acknowledge that this is still a field of research in their children's shoes, but believe that computer-assisted urban communication will be routine for mankind in the near future.

The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also agitating its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be possible that the EU and the United States would not react when the war in the Ukraine and the occupation of Crimea by the US.
In international policy, action will be followed by reaction, action countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be strong in the long term.
Iran was able to adapt to negotiations on its nuclear programme only after years.
For decades, the South African racial orthodox government sat in place, even though trade was banned by UN decisions.
There have been sanctions against the war.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take high-voltage electronics or military technology to the Soviet Union.
Russia itself has set barriers to trade on the world's side.
In the recent past, the trade in raw materials was frozen.
It is clear that the force to force Russia cannot bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians have become used to bad times and Viola's disappearance from trade does not cause trouble.
When the EU intends to ban vodka imports from Russia, this is a joke.
The Russians would like to drink that vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft support vessels to Russia, but Finland cannot take milk.
Gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest adverse effect for Russia is not the abandonment of imports or exports of vodka.
The greatest harm will come to the limits of the financial sector.
They will soon be affected by them.
The State of the Union cannot operate on international market markets.
It has to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has huge foreign reserves, they can't last forever either.
Access to credit for Russian companies is slowing down and money is costing off.
Private banks are not able to fund all of them.
Money needs to be weighed more or companies are going to face difficulties in payment.
Competitive competitions are also in Russia, Russia is a commercial country.
If the crisis continues for years, the modernisation of Russia will stop, as was written by Russian expert René Nyberg in Helsinki Sanom.
It wouldn't be the first time.
In time, Russia would return to Russia once again and get in the way.
An exceptional freepain event took place in North Korea.
Some 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed up the international free fights organised on Saturday in Pyongyang, the capital city of Pyongyang.
A part of the event organised by Japan’s Antonio Inoki, who has moved from lawyer to lawyer-free printing, was part of the Japanese, United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to free prices, taekwondo matches were also seen for local athletes.
According to Inok, the objective of the event was to bring the countries in dispute closer together through sport and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, the politicians wished for an improvement in the North Korea-Japann gap.
In summer Japan abolished the sanctions it had imposed on the North Korea following the arrests in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s.
The North Koreans promised to reopen the investigation into these cases.
The last time in North Korea was the year 1995 when we saw a free movement in the EU.
SOK reduces the retail trade of about 110 persons from the commodity.
The Yt negotiations started in June, when a maximum reduction of 130 was estimated for the adjustment.
According to the operator, its organisation has now decommissioned overlapping operations and responsibilities have been clarified.
SOK tells us that it is seeking to take action that is clearly better cost-effective and better synergies between different sectors of activity.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, the background is the transformation of trade, which has shaken trade in goods in particular.
The revenues from the S-group's sales have already been at a loss for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and managers of the SOK's operating and day-to-day commodity trade, i.e. about 530 persons in total.
Turku words: Some of the self-medication medicines are behind the counter.
According to the magazine, there is a need for more medicines to be taken between prescription medicines and those that are taken on the shelf itself, without a prescription, but only after consulting the pharmacist.
For example, according to the Finnish Economic Union, eye drops containing antibiotics could come under advisement.
After an interview with the pharmacist or pharmacist, and if the pre-defined criteria are met, the medicine would be available under the counter, the president of the Economic Union will ask Kirsi Kvarnström in Turku's statements.
Finland already has a short period of time without a prescription, but it is a medicine that requires advice.
One of these is anti-preventives.
Corruption in more precise causes of corruption.
Finland will pay even more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended both by the OECD and by the Council of Europe, for the world is astounded at the minority of acts and convictions in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Ministry of Justice’s working party will be considering whether provisions on trade and abuse of power should be included in the criminal law.
The differences in legislation were raised, for example, in the trial of the Sloven branch of the Patria wedding in Hämeenlinna a year ago.
In Slovenia, trade in power brought in two years of imprisonment to the former prime minister, but the Finnish law does not know the corresponding code of conduct.
The anti-corruption cooperation network has cooperated as required by the Government Programme.
In fact, according to a study of wealth, it is hardly possible to investigate in Finland according to a preconceived view.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from the University of Vaasa and the University of Police University on the risk of corruption in various fields.
Messi potee interoperabilityvammaa - Sport - Karjalainen
Captain Lionel Messi of the Argentinian Country Team will be excluded from Wednesday's land takeover against Germany.
The fair will have a hangover on the side of the view, told him about his company in the Valley on Monday.
La lass keeps Mess away from being a precaution.
The Messiah was offended by the influx of the Sunday league against Villareal.
The game won the draw 1-0.
The fair also missed a charity tour in Rome.
Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes that he is going to get the tutors for the Asia Champions League fight in Korea.
Tony Popovic lacks three key players in Korea.
A wide range of team players are at a game ban at the first match, and coach Tony Popovic does not hesitate to throw other players at the FC Seouli game at the witch stand of the Champions League.
The Wanders are at a ten-day training camp in Dubai, including two resting matches in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match on September 17th.
Because of the excessive yellow cards Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole pass the trip in the region, but Coach Popov believes in their trainers.
"Of course this is a loss – they have been three very important players at the ACL for us," Popovic says.
Tomi Juric in China took part in a game ban against this gesture.
It's a setback, no player should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Anyone will be replaced, he's probably done a lot of work, and I trust the whole team.
I'm not only afraid to play anyone against them in the seminals.
The Wanders will also be without Spiranovic, who will continue to recover from ankle surgery.
The defender of the The Soceroos team was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in the return match at the Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
"He's back in his career and he's fine," says Popovic.
He will follow his own training programme and go with us to Dubai, which is a good news for him, because it means a first return to the field.
He's already been out a couple of times, which is good.
It's gonna be a while before she's okay, but she's gonna be fine.
The Wanderers team has world-class facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also feels it is good to get to know each other better after the great changes of the end of last season.
"We know that this will help players to be sure to create ties," says Popovic.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better both on and off the field.
So we use the camp for many purposes.
The elite burger pays three times a monthly employee’s monthly salary three times.
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea you can enjoy the luxury of the rich economies if it happens to be part of the elite of the earth.
The Financial Times reports on the financial markets which are being torn up by the opposites.
In North Korea, non-official markets flourish more than ever.
They offer a luxury that has not been accustomed to a single dictatorship for wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: the entertainment centre, where the ticket only pays the average wage of up to 10 months' workers.
The site will receive burgers who will pay $76.
That's 3-5 months' pay for the entire country's outskirts.
In a swimming pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
The "west market" of North Korea was born in the 1990s when the earth suffered from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even if the prices of the goods can at least be gross.
Then, in the capital of Pyongyang, many people have a mobile phone with 200 bucks in it.
A part of this may be the ruler of Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an energetic and youthful image of himself.
In the past, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the country's prosperity.

Ormiston House: Stormont's Council would like to express hope of sales.
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it will have found a buyer at the Ormisto House, a building in Belfast that will pay taxpayers nearly 3000 pounds a week.
The Council bought a building from the 19th century in the eastern parts of the city 13 years ago and paid £9 million for it.
The Council failed to sell the building again, at which time the security and maintenance of the building would be able to pay the Council around 400 pounds a day.
The building was sold recently for 1.25 million pounds.
The building will apparently be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a 9 million pounds of building classified as a category B of historical significance in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was subsequently found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was reintroduced at a price of GBP 2.5 million this time.
The building could not be sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, from the Ulster Unionist Party, suggested that Ormiston House should perhaps be a new international trauma centre for trauma.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the representative, the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate intermediary remain silent as to the identity of the buyer and the price of the sale.
The weekly safety and repair costs of Ormiste House are about 3 000 pounds.
The Council bought a building from the police force that went ahead with the Northern Ireland Police Board.
By the beginning of this year, the cost of the Ormiste House's security totalled 885 641 pounds and the cost of transport 371 379 pounds.
The cost of repair and maintenance professional services was 250 015 pounds and the fees of development and design professionals were 212 466 pounds.
The building was previously owned by the shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in a building until 18 August, when it was purchased by William Pirrie from Harland. Pirris later became Chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Shortly after the death of Lord Piri, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. It was sold by the company to Campbell College in 1928, which held it in possession until the middle of the '70s.
"Eequality is increasing": Helsinki is seeking to reduce access to education and training aids.
There will be no saving, claims JHL.
Helsinki prepares for a radical reduction in the number of school assistants in the workplace.
A small reduction would not affect the child’s personal assistant.
In the spring, the Helsinki School of Education ended up with a total of around 2.7 million job losses on the resources of school assistants.
In Helsinki there are a total of about 600 school dropouts.
If decisions are taken, they shall enter into force in the middle of the month following the beginning of the year.
According to the JHL, the decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunate to reduce the amount of funding from the budget because the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings are certainly not created, the labour costs of the staff will increase.
At school, savings are more likely to reduce the goals of learning and the ability of teachers to cope is tough, stress Päivi Niemi-Laine, President-in-Office of the JHL.
The city plans of the city are equalising schools because, with future resources, small schools and students needing support will no longer receive the resources of assistants at all.
The aim of the city is to prevent exclusion.
Early preventive work is just done by school assistants.
However, the adaptation measures of the Agency are intended for the most part for this group.
This will be the case for all parties in the future.
In the autumn, the Helsinki City Council will make the final solution to resources, on which I hope to see the vision and wisdom ahead and to act in accordance with its objectives, notes Niemi-Laine.
Israel will take over the land on the West Coast.
In a Jewish settlement called Gevaot, the Israeli women are visiting the territory of Etion, near Bethlehem.
On Sunday, Israel took over nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank in the Jewish settlement area near Bethlehem, which may be a sign of Israel’s future significant construction in the region, and at the same time threatened the Palestinians’ request not to accept more housing and a threat to the public opinion of the world community.
The Israeli "Peace Now" group, which opposes the expansion of the authorities in the West Bank, considered that Sunday events could be the largest single land occupation in the West Coast region for decades and could "develop dramatically the situation in the region".
The aim of the Palestinians is to establish their own state for the countries that were conquered by Israel in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, a political response to the assessment of the situation in the land was taken after three of the Israeli youngsters were kidnapped and killed in June after they were picked up in the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the land takeover suggests that it was meant to be a kind of a reward for the population of the population and for the Palestinians.
The land in the territory of Etzio, in the territory of South Jerusalem, close to the Jewish Gevaot authority, is now officially declared a "state" when it was formerly owned by the Palestinians, a necessary step in order to enable Israel to start planning buildings in the area if it wishes to.
However, Ahmad Lafi, the mayor of Surif, the nearby Palestinian city of Surif, said that the country belongs to the Palestinian family.
He told the official press office of the Palestinians, WAFA, that the Israeli army and its staff published early Sunday regulations declaring Israel to take over Surif and the nearby countries of Al-Jaba'a and Wadi Fukin’s olives and other trees.
Any objections must be made within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people by Israel's army on the West Coast was punishable by a group of Islamists ruling Gaza against Hamas, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The subsequent tensions at the border between Israel and Gaza flowed into a 50-day war that ended last week's ceasefire by Egypt.
The takeover of the land has quickly brought attention to the West Bank ruled by the Israelis and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli government that hinder the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
The crisis settlements in Lapland tend to be complex problems.
An increasing number of the municipalities of Lapland are in problems, as is apparent from the health research conducted by the University of Lapland and the University of Applied Sciences of Lapland in the field of health research.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, the reduction in the number of municipal tasks of a billion euro is not enough.
The common features of the crisis are, among other things, weak households, low employment and migration losses.
According to Professor Asko Suikkanen, professor of sociology at the University of Lapland, new jurisdictions are coming from the western border and from the East Lap.
In the survey survey survey, the residents were very realistic in assessing their condition.
In the work, the residents of well-managed municipalities even had a pessimistic view of the prospects.
Firm expectations have an impact on consumption.
They wish the present everyday and well-being to be maintained, perhaps even a little improved.
At this time, you are not dared to think of longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling," Suikkanen says.
The group of researchers was surprised by the large differences between the municipalities.
For example, income support expenditure per capita varies from two to tens to over 100 euros.
The municipal income per capita varies from 2 000 euros to 4400 euros of the Scarce of the Lamb from Ranua's route to 2 000 euros.
According to the hive, the municipalities of Lapland differ from one municipality to another.
How to use money, how much to obtain government shares and what is the degree of debt, is the difference between each person in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close the border with Islamic fighters who return to the country.
Britain may temporarily prevent Islamic fighters from going to Iraq and Syria from returning to its home country.
The BBC will report on this subject, referring to the government ministers.
According to the BBC, however, British citizens suspected of terrorism should retain their citizenship.
According to the source of government, this is one of the many suggestions that will be considered.
The proposal is currently under way, and Mr David Cameron is due to present it.
The government is also looking for ways in which it could impede the deployment of potential fighters abroad.
One way might be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily confiscate the passports of potential fighters at the border.
Britain raised the threat of terrorism to the second highest level on Friday.
Bob Carr delights in the immediate release of Australian lawyer Melinda Ordina Orin from a prison in Liberia.
The American attorney, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from the Liberian prison today.
The federal government was glad to hear that the authorities of the United States were expected to release Australian attorney Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr's representative said that "all will be well" and the International Criminal Court's law will be released from custody of the Australian authorities this evening, and then he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased to hear that he will be released today," comments the representative to the AAP Press Office on New York.

According to the authorities of the country, the paper they think threatened national security was delivered to the safe.
Senator Carr has been in a lot of trouble to release Taylor, who, among other things, traveled to the capital of Libya, Tripoli last month in order to drive this matter.
He could not have talked to his husband or his little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a phone call home to the Hague shortly after the visit of the Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with parents John and Janelle, who lived in harlot Brisban, who were relieved to hear that urin was soon allowed to use the phone.
The parents of Bethi had appealed to Libya to release their daughter before the third birthday of this little child in July.
The other two lawyers under arrest are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr reported a week ago that following a debate between the Law of the Hague and the authorities in the Hague, "the Judge of the Criminal Court was sorry and apologized for the possible misunderstanding.
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of any mistakes, but has promised to examine the activities of its team thoroughly after its members have returned home.
"After the end of its investigation by the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all who have done the wrong will be brought to justice in the right way", the court informed last month of its notification.
The International Criminal Court is asking the 39-year-old Seif al-Islands for crimes against humanity during the last term of administration, which suddenly ended last year.
According to the Court of Justice, his trial should be local and, on 1 May, he took an initiative in which he announced that he would not accept the decision of the Advocate General of the Court of Justice to sue in The Hague.

The collections to the Ferguson Police were mysteriously terminated after the $433,000 overrun of the 433 000 dollar.
Administrators closed two online collection sites this weekend, without any explanation, after collecting more than $400,000 from sites to a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, in the state of Missouri, in the United States of America.
For the general public, on the open GoFundMe website, two separate pages of similar names – "Sport Officer Darren Wilson" and "Sport Officer Wilson" – have been collected by $235 750 and $197 620 for a Fernando police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site had been collected by Brown’s customer for $314 099 a day after the Sunday afternoon.
The shooting resulted in many long-lasting restlessness and demonstrations, mostly against the close white police forces of Ferguson, which was inhabited by blacks, which forced Wilson to hide while trying to determine whether or not he shot Brown for no reason.
The network’s collection campaigns have produced some arguments about the defence of Wilson, especially since some of the visitors on the site had written a comment on racist comments which have since been deleted.
Apparently, both pages stopped receiving donations at about the same time, and the administrators of the pages did not give this reason.
He sees a message saying, "Donations are no longer accepted.
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, the representative of the GoFundMe website gave a notice to the Los Angeles Times that the site has not prevented donations from being made.
"Every GoFundMe campaign organiser will decide for himself if he wishes to stop receiving donations", said Kelsea Little, representative of the GoFundMe website.
The organisers may also, if they so wish, delay receiving donations later.
The "Sport Officer Wilson" page, the yield of which was $197,620, is maintained by a charity team made up of St. Louis's police officers, Shield of Hope, who is the recipient of donations accepted by GoFundMe.
Three police officers designated as official representatives of the Government of the Shield of Hope collection register for Joseph Eagle, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda did not respond immediately on Sunday to the e-mails asking for information on the assembly campaign.
Zoll is an official officer of the Roorda Missouri Police Department, and Egan is a close member of the Florissant City Council and a member of the Roorda Missouri House.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the "Sport Officer Darren Wilson" page, who calls the "Stand Up" and has collected $235 750. He has not been identified as the recipient of the donations received by the site.
However, a representative of GoFundMe assured The Times that there is a genuine benefactor in its press release.
As regards the anonymous good of the collection campaign, only limited information has been given to the donor, unlike the administrators of another Wilson or Brown Donation Site.
The Beneficiary of the nameless website wrote to visitors of the site two weeks ago a message stating that the site cooperates with the Shield of Hope Group in order to become an officially accepted recipient of donations.
Authorisation has not yet been granted.
The good guy gave additional information to those who wanted to use the aliased Gmail address, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to the request for additional information.
A representative of GoFundMe said in its press release to The Times that the anonymous summary website has been deleted from the main page search results and added that "the campaign no longer meets the requirements of GoFundMe to be used as a Facebook account".
At the GoFundMe site's information security policy, users are invited to "contribute only to GoFundMe users they know personally and to whom they trust".
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on GoFundMe is correct and correct.
According to the President, GoFundMe has, however, "belonged to the campaign organiser, and there is no reason to doubt his integrity.
GoFundMe will also be able to hold all the funds collected if investigations are necessary in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to reserve funds collected by this campaign.
The popular website "Support Officer Wilson", which has organised a campaign to support Wilson, told its followers this weekend that lawyers are trying to find an explanation why GoFundMe's donors have been prevented from being donated, but this page did not provide any further information.
There is also an anonymous administrator on the Facebook page, and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
