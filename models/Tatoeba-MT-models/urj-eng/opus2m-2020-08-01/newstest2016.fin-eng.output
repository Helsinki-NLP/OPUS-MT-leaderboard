A 9-year-old boy was found on the street running away.
The police have had a search warrant for a 9-year-old boy's escape on Tuesday night.
The disappearance notification of a boy leaving the West Tampere with his friend has spread through social media.
According to the police department, the boy has been contacted, and he has no life or health hazard.
The son's father told the Evening Sannom half-night that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're going to start some ex-post reviews.
The boy was found in the neighborhood of the home, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, once again in terror - tears apart the paint in Messin.
Cristiano Ronaldo hit five paints in the Spanish league this weekend and continued to work in the Masters League as well.
The fight between Lionel Mess and Cristian Ronaldo from the League of Masters nationalities turned at least for a moment to the advantage of the latter.
Real Madrid Ronaldo was the only one who moved to the top of the goal-makers list when he shot a visitor on the Nahtar Donetski network from two hits of penalty kicks and one game situation.
Ronaldo raised his ground level to 80 when, before Tuesday, the Barcelona Mess, which was flat with him, has 77 hits together.
Real won a match of 4-0.
The story has been over in the Italian football league in Serie A since the beginning, but at the Champions League in D, it started with a 2-1 guest victory in the city.
The victory was done by the rich ten minutes before the end of the Juventus Alvaro Mora.
The attacks on the city bore the absence of knee-jerk Sergei Aguero in the absence of knee-jerk Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend’s dial game, came into the field only with the last ten years of news.
The second United States association also experienced hardship in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering the 1-2 loss.
The ManU's 20-year-old foreign defence firm Luke Shaw's visit was due to last only 15 minutes.
The dangerously-looking slider cladding of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the ManU package that was hit towards the paint so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven’s home stadium for a century before medical staff went to see him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the guests in 41th minutes to a 1-0 wire, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreo flattered before the break with extra time.
In the second half of the period, Luciano Narsingh made the PSV's net profit.
In the season of painting, the Champions League started A-block Paris Saint-Germain.
The issue was that of an Argentinian Angel Di Maria, who changed his US shirt to PSG.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball past the back of Malmö's goalie Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made PSG 2-0 for the second half of the PSG.
PSG has been bet on the season's performances.
The default is not false, but Malmö, which is part of too long Euros, is not the best possible benchmark.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the star of PSG, first met Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played for 90 minutes when his team lost the Moscow TsSKA at the B-block match in Germany to Queensland 0-1.
The opposition appealed immediately to resign - the President gave the wrong speech.
President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had given a month ago.
President of Zimbabwe, Mr. Robert Mugabe, has once again given the same speech he gave at the end of last month in Parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, an 91-year-old, was in the full spirit of Mugabe.
The MDC, the chief opposition party, called on Mugabe to resign from his duties because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had happened only in Mugabe's office and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech previously and now China's impact on the country's economy has been addressed by China.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis.
Germany and Austria have proposed the next few additional EU leaders summits due to the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council following the summit, will evaluate the request.
According to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Heads of State should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how more effective registration could be obtained in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Merkel, part of the internal ministers' table.
During an emergency call, the teacher instructs the teacher that she had shot her girlfriend during an emergency call, the teacher tells the teacher that she had killed her girlfriend.
Sound is just a little coloured university teacher Shannon Lamb tells the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police must come back to them.
Lamb stressed that his "gold dog" is alive and probably shocked, and said that contact information for dead women related to her is available on the website.
The police inside the house found a written message on the side of Amy Prentiss's body and on the side of the spell: "I am so sorry that I could withdraw this love from Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," said the letter that was signed by Lamb, according to the experts.
There was no reference to the fact that Lamb, who taught two online courses in Delta State University in Cleveland, Cleveland, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometres to a school campus where the police believe he had shot and killed the history teacher Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study room.
The police chief of Delta State University, Lynn Buford, told about the shooting of university staff at 10.18 p.m.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while after that.
The number of people killed by the end of the day reached one more time: he committed an act of suicide in the hands of a police officer.
The authorities are still trying to explain Lamb's motives the day after the students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the school shooting.
Scientists on both sides of the state have published information showing that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher, who, however, may have had problems.
The students told me they were waiting for her hours.
The police in Prentiss's district of death, Gautier, say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included the book he wrote in Lamb, where he thanked the "great people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both taught at the Social Science and History Institute, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
A student named Brandon Beavers complimented Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, "it was like something was wrong.
Another student named Mikel Sykes said that Lamb reported that she had a lot of stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had asked for medical leave from Delta State University earlier, saying that he had some kind of health problem.
This year he only taught two current rates.
Recent changes in university remuneration principles meant that although Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not give him automatic career development and assistant professorship.
The principal of the university, William LaForge, said that he knew there was no match between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in the mind of Lamb."
These questions are no longer answered.
After Lamb had escaped from the campus, the police got after him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber gun in the back yard about one and a half miles south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, told Methel Johnson, the M.O.D.'s medical examiner in Washington County.
The Lamb car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this very house, even though Johnson said that he believed that Lamb knew the people who lived there.
The gang grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught road and educational fields. The university has 3500 students and is located in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants.
Lamb graduated from doctorate in education in spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston reported that she was 15 years old and Lamb 20 years old when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston's friends were locked up, and Lamb was funny, an older guy who spent several years trying to teach him how to play guitar.
He was quite a charmer back then.
All the girls had melted wax when she was there, now told us about 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
The Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me that he had killed his wife, but there was no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in a riverside brick house in Gautier.
The cop told me the dog was okay.
Prentiss's former husband, Shawn O'Sten, told them that they broke up 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
"He's really upset," O'Sten described his father.
He was the best friend of his mother's.
O'Sten told me he hadn't met Lamb, but he had heard from his daughter Abigail that she was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both present on the summer market three years ago.
Later on, they called together at one of the gigs.
O'Sten told me that his own does and sings his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different businesses.
Mike Shaffer, a barrister and entertainment organizer at the murky bar near Gautier, tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentiss last night, on the night of 5 September, when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip-sharp performances to a limited audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Only a happy couple", he said.
We were kidding and throwing straggles at each other.
So they were both rather clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year's student seminar programme and was specialized in Indians and colonial history, said school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married and had three little children.
He studied at the State University of Kansas Emporia and was President of his Brotherhood and Student Board.
On Tuesday evening, in Cleveland, the Delta State Congress held a candle grip involving about 900 people, including teaching and other staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also took part in the fair during which the university choir sang songs from Bright Morning Star and Amazing Star.
Education starts on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Now is the time to recover.
Audrey and Rogeio Solis report Mississippi in Cleveland.
Associated Press writer Emily Wagster Cheat from Mississippi Greenville and Rebecca Santana New Orleans took part in the report.
The case has been corrected by the fact that the police are now calling Lamb's emergency call since Schmidt was shot, and that even if I referred during the call to Prentiss as his wife, there is no evidence that they were still alive.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season.
Toys R Us says that it does not hire as many employees for the holiday season as last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that current permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to do more hours.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in businesses and distribution centres throughout the country, while 45,000 were employed during the 2014 holiday.
Most of the work is part-time.
The author said that interviews with applicants will begin this month, and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although there are months to stay, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to assist in the management of shops and the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film, the return to the future, was, of course, a huge moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also meaningful for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the arrival of the royals, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana's place was next to me," she said, "a future documentary in Back in Time trailer."
The film comes and reminds me of the fact that I'm just at a party and a stretch of my hand from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary on the Return to the Future film interviewed by Fox, Lea Thompson and Christher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and CEO Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future became its first night 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it is definitely the greatest time-of-all travel film of all time."
Back in Time is available as an order book, DVD and in some cinema theatres in October.
The President of the United Nations says that the situation in Syria is not an armed solution to the Syrian situation.
The reply of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to the fact that Russia will increase military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict "not to be resolved with arms", and that additional weapons will only make violence worse and suffering for millions of people.
The President of the United Nations once again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support no non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban reported at the press conference on Wednesday that he intends to meet with five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - Foreign Ministers in connection with the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional forces "has made the situation impossible to determine."
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate, in the course of dealing with the Syrian crisis, the solidarity and consensus they showed when negotiating the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 support for the results of the survey that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some people have tried to stamp him as a viroid.
Others think he's nothing but a joke.
Part of the expected collapse.
Although some Republicans have tried to get Donald Trump out of the top of the support polls, it has not (not yet) succeeded.
Of the last 11 national surveys in ten Donald Trump has been in the middle of a two-digit series, and some have seriously begun to wonder what this means for the designation of a real estate king.
The election is, of course, just beginning.
These results do not yet mean that the Trump is likely to become a Republican candidate.
The commentaries point out that at this stage in 2011 Rick Perry was losing his lead on the emerging Herman Cain, which neither of which was behind any state in the designation process.
There are also many reasons why he would have trouble with the general elections.
However, external groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the Conservative Economic Association for Growth have noted the persuasion of Somp and started to use their funds to overthrow him.
The following recent statements of support indicate that the real estate king is not just a passing step:
The best popularity figures have been a complete translation.
Just before Donald Trump announced his nomination in mid-June, the support polls of Monmouth University showed that only two Republicans out of ten welcomed the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 per cent.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At the moment, six out of the ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true in the first pre-election states.
In a support survey conducted by the University of Quinni Market in Iowa last year, 60% of Republicans reported that they welcomed Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump became a candidate.
Last year after CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said that they would either be "inspired" or "satisfied" if Trump were a candidate.
Only two out of ten said that they would be "hungry" if he became the candidate.
Only Ben Carson makes about the same level of effort as Trump (43% "inspired" vs.
The next most exciting thing to do?
Marco Rubio is only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be "unsatisfied" or "satisfied" if Jeb Bush were to become a candidate.
The nature of the future fire is not a problem for most Republicans.
Although Donald Trumps have been widely criticised for his excellent speeches and insults, according to the ABC News/Washington Post survey on Monday, 52% of the voters on the Republican side at national level feel that the real estate king has the right quality for the president.
According to a survey from the Quinni Market last week, in the Iowa State holding the first party, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think that the Trump has the right character for the leader.
However, according to ABC/Post's survey, 44% think that his character is not suitable for the president's operation, and nearly three out of ten think that his character is not part of the White House.
Republicists get used to the idea.
When Republicans think like commentators, they think Trump is the real alternative.
According to CNN/ORC’s survey, four out of ten considered the most likely option to be equal in asking who is most likely to be designated candidates for the Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Release of information: The voters of the Republican Party have not always had the brightest possible globe at their disposal.
During this time last week, four out of the ten Republics considered Rick Perry to be a candidate and only 28% supported the final candidate, Mitt Romene.
In any case, this indicates that most of the Republican voters consider the Trump campaign to be credible.
Even if the Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost any one.
Some commentators have pointed out that the rectangular field is likely to have contributed to the Trump leadership, as the support against the Trump has been divided between a number of other candidates.
However, the survey carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a realistic bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump will receive majority support in all cases.
He leads Cary Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubioto by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bushia by 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasichia and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's even with Ted Cruz.
The only real winning choice?
If they were to be put in opposite positions, Ben Carson would win a businessman with the big 18-point difference at the Jõmp.
Just now and just a majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told me that they have made a decision.
The new CBS/NY survey on Tuesday shows that just over half of the more than half of the most profitable voters have decided which of their voices will be lost.
The situation can obviously change, and no one can be absolutely sure to say that it would never change your mind.
46% indicated that they could possibly change candidates.
In any case, the best competitor at present is another unlikely winner, neurosurgent Ben Carson, but those voters who said they had made a decision are twice as likely to be on the Right side.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with the Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapers" in the campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the heart of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that the main focus of the Trump is to drive the Latin voters further than the Republican Party and to harm the rebranding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
It seems that, as long as immigration is at the heart of things, Donald Trump is also involved.
The collapse of the government has reached a new peak.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside politics.
Six out of ten Republicans said at ABC/Post on Monday that they chose a political person rather than someone with government experience.
They are also angry with the federal government.
Two weeks ago, Des Moines Register/Bloomberg's survey of Iowa showed that three of the four Iowa Republics are frustrated with Republicans in the Republics in the United States: 54% are "unsatisfied" and 21% "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn's first appearance on the questionnaire has been eagerly expected since his choice.
The new Director General of the Labour Labour Party will meet David Cameron for the first time at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corby will be asked about his first six questions shortly after the afternoon, and most likely both the media and the working people's representatives will be watching closely for his performance.
Corby has called for this weekly edition of "less theater and more facts".
He has also said that he could leave part of the mission to his colleagues.
This meeting is the first voluntary trial of the leadership of Corbyn after he was appointed to the public administration and spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre for Trade Unions on Tuesday.
At the same time, the president of the Labour Party decided to stand still during the National Supper on Tuesday’s Memorial Ministry, which was organized by the Battle of Britain on the 75th anniversary of the World War, has been critical of the Conservative MPs and has appeared in a number of front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to ignore the national singing has drawn attention to Corbyn's decision not to mention the national singing.
The representative of Corbyn said "union with respect" and acknowledged that he acknowledged "the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the British Air War."
Mr Corbyn, member of the Vice-President of the Corbyn Board of Directors, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight programme that he would have invited the Labour Party leader to attend the National Song, despite the fact that he felt that the King's House should cease.
Almost a dozen ministers of refuge have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, appealing to differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs.
The BBC policy correspondent Robin Brant says that differences in orientations regarding the status of the party in the European Union and the Government’s ceiling have "enhanced" as well as within the working party since the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn, at the meeting of the Centre for Trade Unions, said that the Labour Party is proposing a change that would remove the whole ceiling.
Hours later, the Secretary-General for Employment and Pensions of the shadow government, Smith, stated that the party was "seriously clear" in that they were only opposed to government plans to set the ceiling from GBP 26 000 to GBP 23 000 000.
Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Force leader David Cameron has met during the last decade when he has been president of the Conservative Party.
The Director-General of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to policy, and now he tells us that he has "assessed" ideas for questions for the Prime Minister and has received over 30 000 proposals.
Islington North State Representative Corby has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too conflicting and that he intends to refrain from speaking and speaking both cleverly, but allowing serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people to be addressed.
Corby has said that Angela Eagle, Secretary of Economics of the General Government, is his substitute for Question Time when Corby is not participating, for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should sometimes be allowed to speak, and he has said that he has approached the chairman of the lower room, John Bercow, from the teams.
When Cameron took the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move further away from a political theatre that is often connected to Prime Minister's Question Time, but later he came to the conclusion that he failed.
Since they began to be broadcast in 1990, Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure for assessing the leadership's discretion, his sub-room management, and his position with other MPs, even though critics have criticised the questions that they have become merely a fictitious image that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Homeless young people are trained as photographers.
In the centre of Johannesburg, it is a good place to be homeless.
However, a group of former dissidents have found a way to learn skills and make a living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is a non-profit studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and gain profits from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who were preparing for the first project.

The value value of pounds is rising as the UK's wage growth rises in the UK's growth in wage growth will rise as the UK's growth in wage growth rises in the UK's growth in the UK's growth in wage growth will rise as the UK's
The value of pounds jumped upwards after the numbers appeared to increase in the UK wage increases, while the FTSE 100 index rose with SABMiller.
Between May and July, UK wages and salaries, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent from the same time last year.
The growth rate was fastest after 2009 and was considered to be accompanied by estimates of the rise in courses.
The pounds reached over a percentage point of USD 1 to $1.505, and 0.8 percentage points higher than € 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed down to 6229, 21 per cent at a rise of 1.49 per cent.
SABMiller was the most distinct stock on the market and rose by 20 % after the competitor AB InBev approached it on the offer.
The agreement would unite two of the world’s largest Panels and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Arto, Peron and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after the encouraging news from Richmont from the competing luxury product group.
Richemon's latest sales figures were more than expected, and they also showed that sales in China - which is the market for Burberry - had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 % after the mine left it telling us that it had raised $2.2 billion by calculating shares as part of its debt cutting strategy.
The share of Mondi's share in the index was 4.3%, after Goldman Sachs changed his recommendations from company to "sale".
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after a sports investment company released the data for half a year before taxes: 83 per cent increase to 46.6 million pounds.
According to the Director of JD Sports, higher wages may harm enlargement.
Peter Cowgill, Director of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers is raised in the United Kingdom, it could mean that "the purchasing power of potential energy becomes stronger".
However, this leverage is not likely to exceed higher labour costs for the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be related to the company’s enlargement plans, he added, which would mean less additional jobs.
Metcash will start a grassy-level campaign against invading the Aldi sector.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA trade from Aldi's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash food wholesaler has launched a grass-level campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi will prepare for the opening of two distribution centres and first trade in the early next year to South and West Australia, which will be up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA-supermarkets will strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through the marketing of mainstream and social media and events such as the Adelaide show.
Traders and purchasers of IGA have jumped in, and brands like the ice cream manufacturer Simmo's from Dunsborough offer corn in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount-priced tickets to Australian football prices to their customers.
Metcashin is expected to disclose further details of its defence strategy on 29 September, when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron will organise an annual investor strategy for the final day of the investors.
There is a lot to be played because South and West Australia account for nearly 30 % of the area of Metcashin IGA stores in total, with a profit margin higher than that of the IGA network of the eastern Metcashin States.
Visitors from South and West Australia are known to be in the region, and IGA dealers have a much higher market share than in New South Wales, Hong Kong and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture about 5% of the market in these two states within 12 months of the opening of the first movements.
In this week’s report, Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimates that IGA dealers may lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash may lose 250 million dollars by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 movements in the south and the west, which will generate a turnover of USD 500 million and USD 600 million in these areas.
Loss of food and food sales and quantities at the base of Metcashi’s high costs may cost Metcash about 13 million dollars of operating losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states mainly for Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA customers were the most loyal of all.
Mr Stanley believes that Metcashin's food and food sales will fall by 3.8% in 2016; 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last year, the manager of the investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, Hamish Douglass, said in business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very possibly lose in a decade."
Metcash has refused to reply publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it is understood that the member of Metcashin's Board of Directors would have contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has decreased from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the yields of Metcashin's food and food business, which delivers products to around 1 1200 IGA resellers, have decreased by 43% since 2012, which is the result of a reduction in the financing of debt when the pressure on sales and margins is under pressure.
However, the retailer still holds its balance and has invested more than 150 million dollars a year in weekly calculating the prices of hundreds of products at the same level as Coles and Wolworths, helping IGA dealers to repair stores by increasing faster growth of fresh food, and by bringing a better choice of private brand products to the market.
Ian Morrice, Director General of Metcashin, says that the calculation of prices and the improvement of stores have increased the attractiveness, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the path of growth in revenue in 2017, for the first time in four years.
The President of the Council of Australia, Steve Healy, supports Sunasi Kokkinakis.
Thanashi Kokkinakis deserves honor rather than criticism of his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has had to suffer side by side in the recent storm, which has ravaged around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more honor than criticism of his own behavior, states Steve Healy, President of the Australian Tens Association of Tens.
Kokkinakis, a most senior member of a wealthy twin named Special Ks, was, without a doubt, exposed to a case in which Kyrgios was agitated by St. Wawrika at the FF Masters Competition.
Shortly after this, the main judge in Cincinnati had to make a difference between Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, when Harrison declared: "Warrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that cock."
Even though the last time I saw the cook decomposition of his country, after the cramp ruined his possible victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a firm defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth from another place in double games with Bernard Toci in the semifinal of the Cup against Britain.
"I am quite strongly of the opinion that your Thana has only been drawn into a mess", Healy said.
He broke his mail when he lost his seizure at the US Open, but he is not the first player to break his country when he was hurt, and I know Tanas well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But he has done very well, even in fairly provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves to be praised.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
She's very mature at the age of 19, she works hard, fits into the team and so on, and she's never had problems with other players. She's been appreciated in the dressing room, she's practicing hard, she's in good condition and she's a very calm and mature young man, and I think she should be judged according to her merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to enter Kyrgio into important games starting on Friday, describing this "common decision" as a good decision for all, but still supporting the return of the Canberran team to the permanent platform.
"We want the team to be completely focused on games and not everything around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And Nick has risen really fast, as Federer and Murray have observed, and he is in the public, and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he has received. Nevertheless, we try to support him, try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and him if he spends some time out of the public discussing these consequences.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants.
Hungary declared an emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia, holding those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim of placing the flow of migrants entering the country.
There was chaos at the border when hundreds of immigrants gathered in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities responded to a knockout.
The people who fled their home country's violence have now established their tents and have been on the road for a limited period between inspection stations in two countries.
Index of fluctuation increased.
While the police helicopter stayed in front of them, immigrants were saying, "Open the border!" and calling out insults to the Hungarian riot police.
They refused food and water to protest.
The Serbian foreign minister declared that it was "unacceptable" to return from Hungary when they arrived all the time from Macedonia and Greece.
"(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to harm civilians.
The debate is scheduled for the next few days with other countries and Brussels," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
A mix between Hungary and Serbia was established after the failure of the group of 2 nationalities to establish a common policy on immigration at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers were hopefully talking about reaching the final agreement - next month or by the end of next year - on which EU countries take 120,000 extra refugees, including some of Hungary.
On Tuesday, the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will call for next week's extra EU summit to discuss the migration crisis in the country.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act soon.
Tuesday's emergency in the southern region gave the authorities a greater mandate to act in a crisis and allowed you to be shut down and to speed up asylum cases.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the border with Serbia is complete, the country will also be able to set up a section of the barbed wire fence on its anti-Romanian border to stop the flooding of immigrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that even prisoners had been recruited to finish the lead wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the largest bottlenecks and destination for refugees from the European Union, many of whom are war escapes from Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed that most of the arrivals are economic refugees looking for a better life, and not under war those who are entitled to protection - this view strongly contradicts other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary are now a criminal offence over or harming a 4-metre (13 ft) barbed wire fence built by the government on the southern border with Serbia and include longer prisons for convicted human traffickers.
"As a result of the situation of mass immigration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency," the Government’s informant Zoltan Kovac told journalists in the south of Szeged.
In fact, it is very clear: crossing an illegal border is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the expected military deployment for the first week, but the suppliers of the Associated Press at the border have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with their vehicles and dogs for several days now.
Gyorgy Bagoki, the domestic security advisor of Orban, said that the authorities had captured 45 people while trying to cross the border and 15 people who have already arrived in the country.
They got over by hurting the fence, they're being held by the police, and they're being accused of the offences laid down in the new laws.
The fence is quickly fixed by the authorities.
On Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the three crossing points against Serbia after they had sent a train covered with a silicon wire to close one of these places.
The main border crossing point near Rosske, Hungary, was covered in chaos when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for human processing and the people infiltrated it.
About 20 got in, but thousands were left out.
One group of immigrants blocked main engines between Serbia and Hungary, meaning that they refuse to eat and drink until they are allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 election: National survey shows that Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed to half of Bernie Sanders in Hillary Clinton.
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton will continue in a two-digit lead in the Democratic Name Contest, but Senator Bernie Sanders will arrest him.
Clinton now supports 47% of the voters of the democratics (calculated from 58%), while the other Sanders support 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether or not he is going to the presidential race, but he supports 15% of the voters of the democratics.
More than five months before the beginning of the pre-elections, the majority of the democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote for.
However, Clinton's supporters stand behind their own choice more strongly than other candidates' supporters.
Clinton's popularity has decreased among many population groups since last month's CBS News Poll survey, while Sanders has risen somewhat at the same time.
Clinton is strongly in charge of women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed down.
His popularity with men has fallen considerably, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's front-end in the population of democratics under 50 years of age has disappeared, and he's now level with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads with older voters.
Last month Clinton led Sanders with a double number of liberals, but now Sanders is leading this group by five miles.
About half of the country’s democratic voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm if he becomes a party candidate.
The fourth says that he supports him with some reservations, and 15% would support him simply because he is the candidate.
Six per cent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
Opinions are more confusing for those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only a quarter would be eager to support him.
Where 48% of the voters of the Democrat say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, one of the Republicans' first-man Donald Trump, the same says the third Republican voter (35%).
When Clinton's supporters were asked why they wanted him as candidates, the most popular answer was that he had the right experience (16%) and then the most popular answers were that now is the right time for the president (13%) and that he is the best candidate for 10%.
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 %).
The same opinions and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President influences the potential candidate for presidential candidates, 57% of the democratic voters want to see him already in the race - although the third disagrees.
When asked by the democratics who they chose to name the second party, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, over half say that they chose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to apply for a democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton's management of Sanders will grow. If Biden comes along, the leadership will be 20 percentage points, but if he leaves behind, Chapter 30 will be the case.
55% of the democratics believe that Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidential election, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
At this point, Biden remains far away, but the proportion of those who consider him to be the most voting for him has increased.
However, when people asked what was most important about candidates, they raised opinions to the vote.
Again, last month, no democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered to be an impossible candidate for these voters.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates will be able to do well on certain key issues among the voters of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden is the best of the triples in truth, while Clinton's strength is the driving force.
30% of the democratics say that Clinton does not think he is honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27% say that you do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democratic voters in general also consider that Clinton, Sanders and Biden are ideally in agreement with each other.
In view of all these elements, about a quarter of the democratic voters say that you have no opinion on Sanders.
The use of the personal e-mail address and server of Hilary Clinton as his foreign minister still raises questions, the majority of the Democrats are pleased with his explanation of the matter and says that they did not have an impact on their general opinion on him.
However, it is different when you look at America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third is satisfied.
Public opinion was held in March shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that the e-polemy did not affect their common understanding of Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion of him has deteriorated.
More than six out of ten Republicans say that their opinion of Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters think he's honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32% think he's honest and reliable, and this figure has dropped by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of the registered voters say that Clinton does not think that it is honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of all registered voters in the whole country do not consider the Right to be fair and reliable either.
However, neither Clinton nor the Truths are considered to be good leaders.
The six candidates involved in the study Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most important candidates.
Sanders are generally considered to be honest, but many people do not have an opinion on him, just as they do on Carson.
The error margin in the investigation involving 351 democratics is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson approaches Donald Olympics in the national survey.
Ben Carson is coming to Donald Trump near the latest CBS News/New York Times.
The two candidates gathered half of the total number of votes on the new round, leaving others fighting for a foothold.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favour of the Trums, whose support has risen from 23% to 27% of the survey issued on Tuesday by the CBS polling on last month's Fox News.
However, Carson rose sharply from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with different demographic groups and is being replaced by the senior Republican voters in the Trump.
The rest of the field is behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasichi. The support of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has fallen most: from 10% last month to 2%.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkkass Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio are ranked in the third place at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of this most recent Republican rectifier of the 376 survey conducted in September is +/- 6 %.
Last published last year's CNN/ORC survey showed that Carson was on the rise in the questionnaires: he has 19% support for the Republicans, and Trump is ahead of him in the 32st century.
According to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was also a significant advance of Carson.
As Carson's popularity rose last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgeon for nothing, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday on his campaign visit to Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of the first year of the Baruch College student.
Almost two years after the student died at the Brotherhood Simulsion ceremony in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the murder has been brought against five people.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi community of the University of Baruch College in New York brutally visited Chu's "Michael" Deng during the membership dispute in September 2013 and then delayed taking him to the hospital, thus contributing to his death, the police noted.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with a 13-pound backpack full of sand, and then he was repeatedly hit to the ground when he tried to walk through an ice-cream field towards the goal.
In the end, Deng complained that his head would be hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
The board members didn't call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but according to the charges, they waited an hour before they took him to the hospital, the police will tell us.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the network for information on his symptoms, and contact the Brotherhood's National Chairman Andy Meng, asking for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told the press conference.
"This is where the members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, put the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng," said the police chief Wagner.
Deng was not reinvigorated, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng was hit by a repeated attack on the head, body and thigh of a boring object.
"There have been too many families who have suffered a brotherly accident when at least one student died every year since 1970 as a result", said Doug Fierberg, Deng's representative lawyer, in his opinion.
Brothers and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The grand jury of the Monro county supported the fact that the first five members were charged with murder at first instance.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, will also be charged with violent mutilation and criminal plotting.
"We do not want to be held accountable only for the individual. If behind what happened there is an organisation that approved the matter either officially or informally, they will also be held accountable," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the Brotherhood and the National Brotherhood from entering the local branch.
This happens when the United States Central Bank increases the ratio.
The interest rate rise will come and the emerging market for exchange rates will fall, the yields of bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take or how long it will take.
The past does not provide much help as regards timing, as is precisely the case with the economy.
The return has taken only 11 months since the first increase, while the return has taken as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the central bank in raising interest rates has often, although not always, been a factor in determining how the economy and financial resources are responding.
That is why the US Central Bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on raising interest rates, but rather on the trend of the time to normalise.
There are indeed several variables in the equation.
However, in the end, market participants may find that all interest-bearing lending has been overrated.
"The first increase following the global economic crisis in the Central Bank will inevitably be interpreted in some circles by the end of the 'bad money' era," said Capital Economics' Chief Executive Officer Julian Jessop in his message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the U.S. to return to normal, albeit still low, levels are the kind of revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it does not have an effect.
The following is an overview of how some economic sectors will respond on the basis of previous developments:
As seen on the market during the last month, waiting for interest raise can make the situation unstable.
When the increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite so dramatic.
"It seems that the return on capital tends to stop for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank’s analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the bank’s increase.
In fact, over the last almost 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of approximately 14% as a result of an increase of 250 days after that, the situation is fairly steady (mean increase of 2.6%), and the normal state has been reached after 500 days with an average yield of 14.4% in the last six cycles, reports the recent analysis of the leading capital strategy for the Nuveen Asset Management company, Bob Doll, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deuce Bank, the effect on shares is generally clearer at a later point in the period of increase as the yields start to fall.
The yields are part of the economy, but interest payments often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not previously been identified and which can stimulate the recession.
This is in particular the GDP that will be closest to the lowest level of all times before the central bank’s interest purchase.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 increase since 1950, nominal annual GDP has only been below 4.5% twice as high as the previous year.
In the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, but it is unlikely that it will last until 1.5 per cent after the third quarter, says the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank.
The rise in interest rates in such a fragile economic arrangement can be risky and raise the question of whether "this is different", Deutsche Bank noted.
The market participants have booked an increase of the central bank throughout the year, and everyone expects this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee to end on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept the increase at this meeting, the futures trade only envisages a 25% probability.
"Our research shows that since 1950 all increases have so far been taking place in supercyclics where GDP has passed its previous peak very quickly after recovery has started," the report says.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession, which has been the worst of the course.
In the current phase, the Central Bank has been looking forward to the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now 74 months in progress.
The return on income has also been unstable while the market is waiting for interest payments, and the pattern is a bit like capital perceptions.
The main point is that when the central bank changes its line, its effects will be reflected in documents rather than in shares.
The trend in debt yields seems to change immediately with respect to the first increase/action of the cycle.
The end of the rise cycle will immediately decrease the yield of the documents," Deuce Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategies believe that raising interest rates will lead to the convergence of income from longer and short-term documents, thus reducing the return on income.
High-income bonds often produce better in such a situation, even though "we are still cautious about finding a return", Schwab's firm-income analyst Kathy Jones stated in a analysis of one of the following:
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already stabilised with the central bank’s policy expectations.
"In addition to the fall in dolar strength and inflation expectations, there are several indications that markets have adapted to the outlook of tighter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are high, yields are more stable, credit margins have increased and instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened up its policy.
In general, companies whose business is mainly based in the United States will win as the exchange rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies that have a lot of debt do worse when the increase in the value of the dollar makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they are for funding.
"Historia shows that 'quality' shares are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest rate increase", the analysts of Goldman Sachs observed in the customer report.
Companies with strong turnover missed weak turnover after increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital gains and low volatility shares performed better than higher-quality companies, with an average of 4 (percentage) and 3 (percentage).
The debt will be a big problem.
Those companies with high interest rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
In addition to stock exchanges, consumers too have the potential to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Also, savers can profit from higher incomes, even though experts disagree on how fast the effect feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of the Classic FM, says Congressman Andrew Bingham.
Mr Andrew Bingham, Commissioner for the Congolese Parliament, accused the Channel of "nationalisation".
He claims that its separation from the commercial competitor will become increasingly important.
He also won the BBC Music Awards awards, saying that they were simply copying the British Awards awards.
The Voice of the Member of the Parliamentary College, Mr Damien Collins, criticises The Voice, saying that it is neither original nor original either.
BBC Radio 3 is becoming a "classic FM", claims by the leading congressman to increase the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Conservative Commissioner Andrew Bingham also told the leaders of the BBC that the public service radio was ‘national’ and that it was increasingly easier to distinguish between a commercial competitor and a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't want to use the term "nationalism" - is turning into a Classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards Awards, which was launched last December.
"The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, appear only to be a British Awards sector under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two directly an example of what I remember when you actually just saw something that already exists on the market," Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC contested the accusations claiming that BBC Radio 3 is much ahead of its commercial competitor as regards live music and sharing information to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches things about classical music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music is in fact a first-class commitment.
"In addition, I think it is really important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works," he said.
Last year, the head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the network must work more than before to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
Radio 3 was not, however, the only part of BBC's supply that was criticised for entering the toe of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Voice, the music competition that BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media is estimated to be 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this program is often discussed because it is neither original nor in any way original?
Lordi Hall claimed that this BBC-channel program, where Paloma Faith and Boy George are the stars, was produced "in the same way as the BBC".
He added that he wanted the production company to "find success in its own house" the next time it starts a show of entertainment.
However, he refused to stop the production of future The Voice seasons or to decide that the money of the promised contributors would be used for other forms of entertainment.
The sale of the web was at least last in August, but Black Friday may be the cause of the online sale.
Net sales rose by 7 per cent in the first three months of 2015
The increase in last month was the lowest in 2000 after the start of statistics.
Three years ago, online sales strengthened the use of mobile devices for shopping.
Experts believe that November Black Calendar may avoid consumption.
For more than a decade, the activity of virtual shopping has grown sharply and transformed many of the UK’s shopping shops into ghost cities.
However, experts say that there are now indications of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015 for the first quarter of 2015.
Total consumption in August grew at least after the start of statistics in 2000: only five per cent of the increase last year.
Experts say that there are indications of a levelling of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
"If we look at the growth levels of previous years and return to 2000, it was clear that the situation would be rationalised over time", Andy Mulcahy, the supplier of the JMRG sales index, told Guardian.
He explained that three years ago online sales strengthened when buyers began to use their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made shopping online, and that they could be made in different environments, like on a couch, for example.
But now it is settled, and (growth) can fall.
The Black Friday event from America has been considered as one of the reasons behind slowing down trades.
Experts believe that consumers will control purchases before the last Friday of November.
Last year’s average number of buyers five times higher than the average last year were flocking to their computers to grab shops, pouring down many traders’ websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, which caused the buyers to argue about the findings, can be abhorred by shopping.
A study published by the British Retail consortium found that only about 1 out of 5 pounds was used online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and machines, more than a third of the purchases are now made from shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using a shopping street fashion chain.
The Muslims bury the dead in Meka’s lifting throat accident, the consequences for the Bin Laden family.
The Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funeral in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partly been responsible for the collapse of the construction of the leftover Saudi Binlad Company.
The Ministry of Health explained that, in total, 394 people were also injured when the crane collapsed.
29 dead were carried through the streets in the air when hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, and the victims died when the crane crashed at Meka's grand universe.
In the main case, the white-skinned people filled the path to honor the first of the dead who made their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A sad procession passed through a sacred place where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of the mosque and poured down the worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed the construction company of Bin Laden’s family for the disaster in which 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 gods were carried through the streets by the killing of the graves of the graves of the Meka Great Mosquest.
Among the dead were four children's father Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been in a large Mosquito with his parents before the beginning of the annual holocaust pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the hajj Mecca will go on when thousands of people arrive in the city all the time.
Today King Salman noted that the Binladin Group should not have left up the crane when it was not in use.
The English version of the decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency stated that the Binladin Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the News Office did not mention this detail, but it said that the directors of the company are prohibited from staying abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to know what caused the fall of the cranes in the courtyard of the Great Moscow, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had met before the horrendous pilgrimage that took place this month later.
The Binladin Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the deaf and its representatives have not been caught up for comment.
The royal decision also accused the group of failing to provide up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of cranes around Mecca’s large mosaic, which are part of the huge building stock run by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi Arabian ruler family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a rebel son who was banned by the family in the 1990s.
The collapse took place in windy and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that every capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
Authorities report that 158 people are still in hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rials (1,4,000 pounds) to be paid to the deceased's relatives and to those who were permanently injured.
The other victims receive half of this amount.
The B&Q boss says that Eastern Europeans' low-cost workers are behind popularity.
The British are increasingly using assistant services," says Veronique Laury.
The number of officials coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise.
As a result, the Screwfix Trades for Professionals will be opened in 200 more.
At the same time, Kingfishher closes the 60 B & Q store around earth.
Author Rupert Steiner, the main author of the city, for Daily Mail magazine.
The British are said to give up their hammers and paint pens and hire skilled Eastern European workers to do domestic works.
It seems that if you're a key with a hammer or a hammer to paint walls, you're in the minority now.
You see, the British are paying more and more assistants to do their own work in their homes, says the manager of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new Director-General of the Kingfisher who owns the home-repair trade chain, said that behind the popularity there is the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a blatant price.
This implies that Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Srewfix sales for employees and close down 60 B & Q sales.
Lary said that he wanted more women to work for B&Q stores, because eight out of the ten purchase decisions made in the store are just the most beautiful sex made.
Most of the staff today are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there is now more than one woman in households with more domestic jobs than before.
Lary said: "The majority of our shop staff are still men.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women, and 80% of the decisions to buy products are taken by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of only five women leading the major companies of the British FTSE100, who has re-constructed their board of directors with equal numbers of male and female men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which 50 % of women in the group, including its Director-General and Director-General, are equal to the group.
Lary said, "This was a conscious decision - the difference is important here.
It has not been difficult to make good friends with the board of directors."
Kingfishher announced an invoice in both income and sales of the six months after the group took over the costs of closing the stores.
As a result of trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screenfix and B&Q stores, is opening 200 new movements.
The three-year government decided to resort to mandatory legislation to save the economy.
The effects were also observed at a time point in time.
The sharp heads of the SAK and other employees' associations began to force immediately and as a result the earth will stand on Friday due to the widespread demonstration of workers.
In the opinion of many, then there will also be reason to reason.
Let's ask if you need to take the strike when you don't feel well about it.
There has even been a counter-reactionary operation.
More than 50,000 people online have already come to report that they are not going to participate in the demonstration but are going to work.
In an old good consensual period, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online site where you protest, but openly, incarnation would have been a murder of a small human being.
Millions of trade unions with a few tens of thousands of people's protests do not take much time, but it gives reason for thinking.
The status of the trade union movement is no longer as obvious as it was twelve years ago.
Not all of them are familiar with the objectives of the move, values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest in the operation of Ay movement, Government's restrictive solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to be rolling on their own agenda, it is now at last in connection with the matter, i.e. the rights of workers to defend themselves, clearly and properly.
Thus, the government may wish perhaps to imprison the role of ay movement when membership of the trade union is likely to become more important than before.
Whatever the opinion of the organizations is, it is silly that the expression of Friday's mind somehow stops Finland.
Finland has long since stopped.
For example, industrial output has already fallen 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product will continue to decline and unemployment will rise.
These things would seem to force all the decisions to come.
The University of Lappeenranta has a tough environment for saving: Objective 4.5 million savings, reduce staff by 130.
The technical university of Lappeenranta will open a savings account with the aim of obtaining a total reduction in costs of EUR 8,5 million.
As a part of the savings, the University will open the YT negotiations on the entire staff, with a saving target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, that means bringing about 130 employees into employment.
In addition, two million are being spent on other activities.
In the context of the Yt negotiations, the budget for 2016 is expected to be 4.5 million deficits for the actual operation.
It will also be influenced by the government's cuts in appropriations.
During this financial year, the university will make a total of around 2.6 million deficits.
The costs will increase slightly next year, but the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The university's total budget is about €85 million, so the saving target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between massive teaching and research cuts and the reduction in corporate finance with our university is very important, says Principal Anneli Pauli, at the press release of the University of Pauli.
Before summer, the effects of the shocks seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in additional funding appears in a new relationship.
Discussions with the officials will take place next Tuesday and will last for six weeks as required by law.
Yle: Onnibus wants to go to Finnish railways.
The owner of Onnibus, a British Sir Brian Soutter, tells Yle that the company also targets rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in taking part in Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest rail transport companies in Britain, Soutter says.
Rail transport is due to be open to competition.
The first thing to do is to switch the distance between the capital district and 2017-2018.
Long distances are scheduled after long distances.
Souter tells us that he has already approached the Ministry of Transport.
In the Ministry of Transport, Yle says that the Onnibus plans are welcomed.
At least Transdev (former Veolia) has expressed interest in other international companies in rail transport, which also has transport by bus in Finland and by rail in the rest of Europe.
The Central Bank has to make decisions on the level of interest rates between the United States and the United States.
The rest of the world will follow the side when the United States Central Bank will meet for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time over a decade.
When Reuters made the survey for 80 economic scientists, just over half of those who thought last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, now believe that the situation is not yet resolved and interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0,25 %.
This is a historic event, because when the central bank cut the interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central central bank has the possibility of getting out of the zero level and starting to normalise the exchange rates," said senior cloud of Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has functioned relatively well, and recovery has brought billions of dollars into balance sheets and created low inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rosy global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to raise, but the signs show that they also believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 2 a.m. (CET).
The shooter of Delta State University left an apology message.
After shooting his girlfriend at Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleagues later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying that you were "indignantly" about the first murder and hoped that "you can't cancel it" would tell the authorities on Tuesday.
The Mississippi’s Gautier Police Department told me that the Science and Science teacher at Delta State University, Lamb, called the emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday and told me that he's killed and killed someone.
He told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said "killed his wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "hot dog" in the house, which "do not bother anyone", but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller this name, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When the police got there, they found the body of a 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a 45-year-old Lamb hand-written message that said, "I'm so sorry I could take it back.
"And he was the only person who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove nearly 500 kilometers to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before he finally killed himself late on Monday with the arrest of the police.
The principal of the university, William LaForge, said that he knew there was no match between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "there was clearly something in the mind of Lamb."
On Tuesday, the authorities said that despite the claims published on Monday that Lamb would have believed that Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was no "law on information or evidence" of any kind of "three-fold".
Shawn O'Sten reported that he had been married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "good man".
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but remained a dream.
O'Sten told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, a 19-year-old, who was "aboved."
O'Sten told me that Prentiss and his daughters were "one of the best friends ever.
According to Tuesday Knowles, Prentiss worked hand in hand from home. According to Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
The police told Lamb that he had sent to his relatives somewhere on Mondays to tell them that "you're not going to jail."
When the police reached the Lamb Highway 1 near the Bridge later that night, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it there and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued about educational science in Delta State in spring 2015, reports the CV available on the university website.
The stars that lost their charm power.
With an actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), it has been hard in recent years.
In 2001 he had leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to Huhus, he has also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this really requires its taxes.
You'll be out for months due to a double break-up.
Shaw was killed on his right foot by the loss of Manchester United to PSV Eindhoven at the Champions' League match.
Although the defender has stayed in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw will still be able to play this season.
The damage was caused by the unsuspecting shock of Héctor Moreno within 15 minutes of a 20-year-old URBAN crash in the territory of the PSV.
He was treated for 9 minutes in the field and was forced to give oxygen before taking him to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a broken leg and he's in the hospital now."
He'll be moved tomorrow or even day after that, and then he'll be cut in.
This is terrible. The boy comes to South United States at 18 years of age, suffers from difficulties and then plays brightly, and this is what happens now.
While I was in the dressing room, he had a oxygen mask on top of him.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but it takes at least six months to get hurt, and he's not playing in the block.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreo seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli did not punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian operator be mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say that it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged attack on the two-legged leg.
Shaw said: "Thank you for all your messages, the words are not enough to tell you how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Subject: FF United was suffering from the Luke Shaw case and disappearing to the PSV.
The English defender has an additional incentive to recover from next June's European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "It's really bad."
If a player gets out because of this injury, everyone is very sad.
The purpose of our warriors is never to offend an opponent.
Moreon's leg was broken when he played for the Mexican team against Van Galin Holland in the 2014 World Cup.
"Moreno takes this seriously, because it's not meant to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's bad," Cocu said.
I didn't see it that way.
The only thing that I saw was a ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] touched it, but I didn't see Luke's takka.
Moreno said to SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel bad about this, I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of the PSV was also taken to the hospital after Chris Stelling challenged him.
Do you think David Cameron knows Lorax better than this?
Every parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it won't be long before he learns it from the outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When the holiday childcare service asked the Prime Minister for his favorite journal, he chose Dr Seussin The Lorax, the environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was simple, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: "A fun, moving, creative and contains a strong message. I read this book to my children because it always seems to be a picture or message that we have never seen before."
All this is true, but the next recital, where Cameron is supposed to describe the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, in which new characters and details had been added to fill the rather short original text.
"In a city in which all nature has disappeared, and even the air is a commodity, Ted-boy hopes to overcome his dreams towards his heart by fulfilling his desire to see the right tree", the text says and describes the story of a mistress, which Dr Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write, namely Theodor Seuss Geisel, who was right in the name of Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this is not enough questionable, the Cameron text points out, in all respects, that it was taken from the Lorax picture on the Internet Movie Database, which begins as follows: "In a town where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, Ted-boy hopes to win his dreams to the right side of the girl's life."
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it is unlikely that he would be so incompetent as to have been a drunk in the book. In that young, anonymous boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by greedy, wood-cuting and necessary to wealing Kerskanen, regardless of the short, icy creature that gave the story a name for the story, Lorax, which "says for trees".
This relatively invisible PR mission is probably external to an assistant who has probably never read the book 20 consecutively to a child.
The Prime Minister's officer said that the text must have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment on this at this time anymore.
Adam Lyth was obviously in danger of missing out on the team in England, but it was still a bad place.
Playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see the team that England has chosen for the tour, I don't think the return of the last 3-0 serial loss is likely.
I wouldn't shut down any foreign profit from the bill.
Alistair Cook side may be less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it involves good cyclists and the team’s thinking is strong: they have no scars in the year 2012, only a young positive.
Moeen Ali develops in its spin-offs and Adil Rashid is an attack option, although there is an unknown factor at this level.
Subject: Adam Lyth fell from the British cricket team, he was replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth on the team is obviously difficult to analyze for me because I am his head coach in Yorkshire.
Seven of these games have been good against the attackers in challenging circumstances, and the true but bitter truth is that the gamers are judged on the basis of their results.
Of course, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the information, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth in the team could have stopped, but he was responsible for his own destiny.
I hope that if he gets more running for Yorkshire, another chance will come up.
The head coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is, above all, a team player.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long the hitter will be able to track down.
Lyth was elected to the national team seven times, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton was given the opportunity to play both at home and in visitors.
The only problem with the complaint is that the UK chose the Trott first for Col., when Lyth was in state, but the lost possibility is now a past.
Hales comes with us, and it's got a hitter I value.
There's something in him that we saw early in York in this season when he made two points against us in the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as others before him, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in a hit-and-run next to Cook has been put on the table, where an extra feeder would be sent to the field, but we could have four quick ones, and I am not against this.
I don't understand why the perp couldn't hit you there, and this left-handed guy has already proven to be a real cricket player.
Moeen did not necessarily perform his duties in the county in Workestershire, but he is the third of them and there is little difference between them.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games in the first fall of the hill before he entered the opening in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points and didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari will be on the team as a thief, and, little that I've been dealing with him, he feels very impressive about a young man.
People can watch his indistinguishable statistics - hitting the average of 31, with the ball 35 - and think it's a gambling game, but there's not too many passersby and the voters choose young people.
He's learning a lot about this tour.
In front of the team, England seems to have a very strong addition to the coach’s position.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan bat Mák Jayawardene as a consultant to the games may turn out to be a genius.
He is one of the nicest friends in the game and brings with him an enormous amount of experience because he has done everything possible in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along with the white ball games and brings with him both energy and unmistakably froze.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's equalizing or coaching, and he's got the same useful brain as MKK.
At times, new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's team head from Durham, Ben Stokes, rested on a day-to-day basis, Sweden was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, the coach and the selectors do not make a schedule.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the outcome.
Such decisions will never be taken on simple grounds.
Those in favour of the UK's departure from the EU (Brexts) can win if the economy is in trouble in 2017.
David Cameron's short-term renegotiation strategies in order to keep Britain in the EU are becoming increasingly problematic, even though not even taking into account the profound "Is that true or not?" Corbyn's choice of the Labour Party's leadership or the anger of the trade union organisation for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyn and Nigel Faragsa.
European diplomacy recently explained that, since the EU is so deep in various crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States have had their satisfaction with the British self-centred agenda, which is full of ambiguities and disturbing contractual changes that these countries do not want in most cases.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Trade Union Centre decided that it would not want them either if they were to weaken social protection.
Maybe you could call it Dave and George's selfiegenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are delaying summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capital cities, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, whether with or without the local ostrich, and then coming home, which means winning supporters for reform.
Everything is about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outward inside the British EU - "Don't leave us alone with the B.A.," says in Berlin - suggests that the most likely ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care we will then leave.
Ms Angela Merkel is an ally and moderate Chancellor, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to take up her duties before it goes to waste in the same way that happened to the late Atcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France Francois Holland is facing a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He too is a force away.
Poland may soon have a public right-wing government, Spain a left-wing left-wing government.
It is hard to see these countries sacrificed on behalf of selfipheries, when their energy should rather be directed towards preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want to do so because of their own separatist trends.
So, my friend is proposing, some of these ministers may even be planning to make a consciously useless comment, in the form of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 British referendum campaign, to speed up the Brexit process.
"Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-
Europeans have had a hard-on experience of how the greedy Fleet Street newspaper can be and how the European sceptic press's sovereign powers are, which they were not at the time of the 2006 referendum of Tony Benny, when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed by a ratio of 2:1.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-Oportunist who made a name for himself by writing "EU Direct Bananas" when he was the correspondent of Brussels in the early 90s.
Mimiband was probably a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-sponsors, foreign people hacking the phones, and persons who are registered elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Blair actually thought exactly the same about you, but realized that if you're in a cage with a passionate gorilla, the bananas must be abandoned because of the amazement, if you don't want to be on that gorilla lunch list and later on at dinner.
As a matter of fact, Miliband was more blier than Blair itself, as regards the opposition to the Cameron Reconciliation, which was recognised by the principle behind the abandoned Constitution of the EU, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Mari a way out of the situation.
The truth never forgave him for anything at all.
But nice Corby, who kindly killed me in the Westminster Parliament on Monday (I told him that he had no more time to spend on me), seems to be in danger of re-introduced Neil Kinnock's 80s boycott Murdoch strategy, which was a mistake both then and now.
Although it may take some time, he still has to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media, not me, but I doubt Andrew Marr, whose BBC warship Corby left on Sunday.
The official role of Corbyn in Europe is, in fact, mature.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed Europe.
Well, most of the people outside the United Kingdom's independenceist Ukip's military industriousness and the most cohesive nationalists in the Conservative Party can certainly stand behind this opinion.
Hilary "Benn, but not Benn-fani" Benn said this on both the radio and the TV this week, when his internal patrol officer wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint Mr. John McDonnell as the finance minister of the shadow government was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his grandfather was piling up on TV, trying to be disrespectful to his working people's government colleagues, without going so far as to lose his place of government.
Hilary's struggles were more attractive.
But the fight to keep in touch with "anywhere" - benn's limping - was not what McDonnell said, nor does it seem that what Corbyn told the Heads of State or Government at a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever that is, the unserious, emotional and personal image Corby wants to convey (remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important for the time of a modern TV TV, and in particular for social media circles, which are an acceptable basis for growth for paranoids and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to allow Cameron to take a free ticket to Europe by allowing her to see the support of the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for herself.
At least that's what Jenkins thinks.
But the basic round-up between McDonald and Corbyn on EU membership (and in line with their Benn-spiritual regulated economy and anti-financial past) is no longer just a difficult debate with left-wing thinkers, who are the main dogmies of the narration of small differences in accessible skins.
With regard to his dual division of NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning for surrender), foreign diplomats must simply try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste capital (they also have suspicious voters) on concessions to Britain when it can be completely unnecessary?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed with the weak military performance of Brits in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the presence of a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticized the Public Health England's E-Science Assessment of E-Science in Public Health England.
Researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that electric cigarettes are 95% less harmful than conventional tobacco resulted from a meeting with 12 people, some of which had links to the tobacco industry.
The experts on British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lance in a report on electric tobacco by Public Health England (PHE) critics in Lance.
Phe published this recent month's report on the "virtual column", describing it as "a comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to contacts between some agencies and the tobacco industry.
A medical journal published last month by Lancet, who issued an article attacking the "extraordinary hovel base" of PHE's main decision.
Two other scientists in BMJ have wondered whether the arguments "constructed on expensive or sand" have been "introduced".
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health of the European School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: "The main principle of public health is that the methods of action must be based on proven effectiveness."
They say that the public expects that PHE's claim "at present best estimate that electric cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than conventional cigarettes" is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one of the 12 meetings in which the multi-criteria analysis (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinion on the adverse effects of various nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summed up in research.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, which the Director-General is told has received funding from British American Tobacco for research purposes.
He also supported the public health authority of BAT in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported having received funding from the manufacturer of electric tobacco, but not the money they are told to have received from Philip Morris International in the past, they will increase.
The criteria for the selection of panel members are not explained, but the panel consists of several well-known producers of electric tobacco, some of which also indicate that they have received funding in the field of research.
Others who were present are not known about their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the President of Phe.
The study produced by the group "in a great deal of public knowledge" shows that there is a lack of "undisputed evidence concerning disadvantages in most of the products and most of the criteria", McKee and Capewell write.
None of these contacts or restrictions are mentioned in the Phe report.
McKee and Capewell say Phe's arguments that "otherwise, there is no evidence that electric tobacco is a route for burning children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at Phe, says that the arguments made in the BMJ have been answered earlier.
He says, "Electric tobaccos are far less harmful than smoking."
Half the people who have died die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks posed by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term impact.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence shows up and what it does not look like, especially when compared with the relative risks, there is so much public uncertainty about the goods.
Almost 80 000 people die each year from smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS £2 billion annually.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, even if electric cigarettes are not safe, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the disadvantages of traditional tobacco - our national responsibility.
The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former Channel 4 Director-General.
Former Channel 4 President Luke Johnson said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would "give anything" from a series of hits such as this one located on Albert Square.
Johnson said that licence payments should be used only for the purpose of carrying out activities which are not done by other British broadcasters.
He criticised BBC for placing public service programmes likely to be public, against the most popular programmes of competitors and on channels such as BBC4 in difficult times of time in public delegations.
After the Director General of the BBC, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to work more closely with other organisations, Johnson said that he rang Channel 4 at the time of six years to create a relationship with the BBC, for a period of six years.
"I do not understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programmes that were clearly agreed upon by unsubsidised competitors", Johnson told the Upper Room Communications Committee as part of its study of the future of BBC.
If the licence fee is maintained - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to those programmes that others do not do and do not do.
The Voicea will be sent to the main transmission time because its future will be supported as much as possible.
The idea that no one else would show the program is a joke, that's ridiculous, that's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said, "I don't understand why regressive taxation should finance programmes that could also be financed without state aid.
The butter is one of those, and EastEnders is the other, no doubt made within the House.
Frankly, other channels would give anything about it.
I don't understand what this is about sending the public service.
I don't think it'll weaken BBC at all."
Channel 4 in 2004-2010, by Joint Undertaking Johnson, said that the BBC is responsible for the hunting of viewers "because of the goals of the people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to achieve long-term support."
His comments on the BBC’s favorite series are similar to those of former Sky Director Tony Ball’s comments. He used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburg in 2003 to suggest that BBC sells series like EastEnders.
Mr Johnson said that the public service programmes of BBC's smaller audience " go to BBC4, which at all at all cannot measure the number of viewers, but the BBC thus fulfils its responsibilities and then can then stand up to £4 billion in the price of a licence fee in the defence of the hypocritically saying that 'of course, we are doing all these unknown programs that no one is looking at'.
They put them in a destination where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the promise, Johnson said to the Committee: "I'm going to get you to look for a more regressive system for who gets the most value for it.
Of course you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is worth a lot, but I don't know if that's true for people who have 150 pounds of big money because they don't use BBC much.
David Elstein, formerly Director of Sky and Channel 5, who also witnessed to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-assess its role as Reith "to inform, train and entertain".
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% of TV and 0.1% of the radio - and that it should take the model of the Australian and Canadian broadcasts and transform the task into "information, education and entertainment".
With regard to partnership issues, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which, according to him, are only shown on television and join commercial companies so that they can be viewed online.
"Sonic genetics" enables the brain to control the brain's cells by means of sound waves.
The video shows how diaphragms change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Researchers have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems so that they can be controlled by sound waves.
Small shuttle snakes change direction as soon as they hit the sound pulse, which is too high to be heard by the human ear.
The pulses function by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with ultrasonic reactive membranes.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light.
Researchers said that worms show the functioning of a new method called sound genetics, which can be used to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Researcher Sreekanth Chalasani of Salk Institute in California La Jolla told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive measure in which people's brains are driven by electrical pulses to treat Parkinson's disease.
The shuttle worms do not normally react to the echo, but Chalasani found that when they were soaked with a microscopic small bubble, the situation changed.
He noticed that the bubbles fixed the ultrasound waves, which then passed through the worms.
The confirmed ultrasonic waves affect the TRP-4 ion channels, the structures that are in the cell cells of some worms.
Sound waves make these ion channels open and activate cells attached to them, reports the report published in Nature Communications.
In order to prepare broad-range shuttle ponds, Chalasani genetically engineered worms so that part of their movement nerves are TRP-4 channels.
When Chalasani was using the modified worms, the microwaves strengthened the sound waves and spread them to the worms where they switched on the modified motion nerves.
The process has some characteristics similar to that of optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that the use of sonogenetics can have some advantages compared to optogenetics.
Like a light that has to send an optical fiber along the desired site within the brain, dilated-haired ultrasonic waves can pass through the tissue unobstructed, so they can be sent to the brain from the head to the head.
"We believe that it may be possible for a gene therapy and a therapeutic virus to make the human nerves that are being targeted immediately react to an ultrasound signal in certain neurological treatments in the present environment," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on the muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

A collector named Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using "Ad Space Hack Pack Packs" packages. It is a six-pound six-pound package of six-pound six keys to the collective's "to get access to a third of the entire planet's bus stop advertising space".
Transport for London is not pleased with this unauthorised "principalism".
For the Paraodia ads produced by one of the Special Patrol Group's collectives.
According to the Cruel Designs Curator and the Gavin Grindon of the University of Essex Journal, artists are increasingly questioning and wishing to export political work to non-gallery audiences.
A lot of artists have started working with activists on resistance fronts when they realized that they had to go to the outside world if they wanted their art to affect society.
A poster against another arms trade greets business travellers on the metro.
Amnesty video has been viewed through Facebook over the last 24 hours more than 100,000 times. It was created free of charge by VCCP, as well as by graphic designers and screenwriters working free of charge.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever found that the replacement fair was not advertised at all - and also in ExCeL's day was an empty point - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic advertising of a shady corporate, but "it was more encouraging to highlight the issue with bright colors and animation."
"They have worked fantastically to help us raise questions about illegal torture equipment sold at fairs", says Amnesty Tom Davies.
The United Kingdom Government now needs to take action and ensure that the means of torture are not illegally sold near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art in the positionings comes from within ExCeL, when the designers trade fantasticly decorated products.
Lets you see that you have received an order from the United States Army in your press release "from the front to the AT4CS RS".
This includes "a unique set-aside warhead, which will have an excellent impact on the back of the tank within the object".
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight gold rules for living in a student residence.
It's been 11 years since I moved to a student residence when I was 19, and then I believed in barettes and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the violence of people I've been agitating and numerous, long complaints from others.
Most of my learning can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving to a dorm can be anything that's really scary about going up to the edge of your head.
It's attractive to talk about where you're from, you're holding the interim year and where you think of Corbyn, and why "I really don't love or hate Marmite because it's really just a ski-free Haha Haha Haha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha i find me in my room."
Take a breath.
And also help others draw their breath - questions and ask questions and interested ones.
It will guide the debate and help you overcome those people you like, not those you don't want to talk to, even if your face is on fire and they'll split the switch.
Give me the room.
People's rooms are often transformed into cocktail parties, movie nights and general entertainment places, but they are also places where people talk and repair their underwear.
Subject: Don’t even think about starting a university when you’re in a relationship.
The university is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a resting place, but many dormitories consist of a room-to-room culture, which is a friendly, social and life-long friendship.
It could mean a word to someone who's trying to rest.
Nothing in this world will allow you to say, "I'm afraid of you and I want to be friends with you, but you have to leave now that I can recover the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing and perhaps send a text message instead of knocking on the door.
Knocking when I heard you talk: knock.
A guy at my student residence thought that if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw real things.
Friend through bakery.
Since you're starting the top of the college bakery order, knocking on people's doors with a chocolate cake plate and presenting yourself seems a little less strange, less "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked something for you, now smile when I ask you personal questions" in the '50s.
The provision of self-awareness is a good way to make a move.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk, and they may be joining your face with a tasty surprise in the future.
Of course, of course. You know how to bake.
Poorly mixed flour-sugar-sugar-fats are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Understandably, taking a line is stealing, but what if you just take the milk of the tea in your tea?
Ask and check with the owner of the milk.
It is only possible that they will grant you permission, even if they boil inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but don't take it any more than my roommate, who mixed up his milk with lattes to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You are not to be so angry that people cannot sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that harlot of proverbs in the wilderness.
My audience asked if they could play their drum and bass music quietly because it was three o'clock in the morning and he had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase volume.
When they finally silenced at five o'clock in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep two hours before making their own music explode, locked the door and left for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to be moving to the same dorm with you?
Otherwise, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you considered your roommate to be your future spouse, you'd be struck together, you'd break up, and then you'd see her every day and possibly lose all your friends with her.
Of course you want what you want, but if a hot roommate is not really your next mate, you could even try to talk to your head.
In that exhilarating moment, when you find that someone has left their keys in his unreadable room, the limit between trickling and bullying is thinner than it seems.
Having a good time is fun, but it's recyclable in a moment.
You can give us a useful and fun teaching to hide something, but never mess up some room with toothpaste and champagne.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in a water glass, which you then put in the freezer, but don't attach their property with a blue sticker to the ceiling as if it were no more.
Racist impact on the residence of foreign students in Kiteella - The house envisaged by the reception centre was set up in Salo.
A racist attack on Kite in North Karelia took place on Saturday morning at the residence of foreign students.
Unlike the police, this is not the accommodation of underage asylum seekers, but the bed facilities for foreign students who have already been in Finland, says Heidi Lukkainen, teacher of the evangelical university of Kite.
The buildings of the University of Nations windows and walls were framed with racist signs, such as forklifts, and a metal object had been thrown through a single accommodation window, reports the Eastern Finland Police Department.
According to Likkainen, who is responsible for the education and training of young people in the National University, there were about 10 people at the time of the attack in the building under violence.
"There was a family and adult people who are free to move, so there could have been a part elsewhere", says Rich.
The law has people who are accommodationd from 12 different nationalities.
In Finland, they are already some of the students who have been living in Finland and newly arrived underage asylum seekers.
All those in a mixed building have a status.
She is studying in adult education, she is studying in vocational studies and she is studying in Finnish," says Mikkkainen.
A status is a so-called permanent residence permit which can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The Eastern Finland Police are investigating a blow as an injury and a violation of the peace of home.
According to the report, a press conference was held for students on Monday, where the necessary interpreters were also present.
There's nothing here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We've had a foreign student for the second year, and this is the first time that something happens," says Monk.
According to everyone, the mess has been cleaned out of the walls by now.
At least three men were suspected of doing this and had been on the move in a light passenger car.
I think this is the climax of a youth weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious," the Rich says.
Salo also has a hospital designed for a reception centre in Salo.
The incident happened last week.
He told me about it on his website on Tuesday night.
The wall of the hospital was characterised by a hakarist and written in English "You are not welcome."
There's been a criminal report on this case.
Acceleration 15 September at 16.02 Adjusted for incorrect information provided by the police about the age and status of the people living in the building.
The state will end the Y-train to the herd - the passengers in a whimpering, "the idiotic" kind of thing.
The Y-train from Helsinki to the Raesepor Karja will cease to pass in March.
The news was agitating the arrival of passengers on the train in Helsinki at the main railway station in the first 24 hours of the day.
In particular, the landing hits the Sanitítian people, said Torbjörn Bengtström, who lives in the municipality.
It's just idiotic, because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can be nothing but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says that with HHTV's interview video, he's going to come to the capital with a tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Uusimaa.
The H- and R-trains on the main track are merged into a new R-line.
The power station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusla will remain out of operation.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and the Media and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry bought road transport for the following contract period.
The period will vary year-on-year and the routes to be closed will be in the whole country.
The new four-year agreement, which will last in autumn, will be adopted by the Monetary Committee later on.
Siunti Bengtström considers that the State's railway car is a short-lived operation.
Make mistakes that have been made before and are repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there will be repentance on top of it.
Y-trains are also used by others other than Raaseporians and Sants, because it is fast and bypasss several stations.
In Finland, Annanina Table was a nuisance for the fate of those who travel more than the city area.
"It is very sad for those who are going to plan their journey again," he said when he was in pain on his Y-train.
A slight relief is permitted.
There must be a new train line on the coastline to replace the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport (HL) area, i.e. to take it to Kirkkonumme.
This will increase the cost to HSL, i.e. actually to the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore the different options and their impact on service area and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, Executive Director of HL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs accurately.
Rihtniemi tells us that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has been paying for Y-trains for about a million years, the Ministry is much more than that.
The R-line on the main track skips between two positions.
On the other hand, the number of train shifts in Ainola and the Sauna Hill is doubled.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease to exist throughout the country.
The Ministry no longer buys rail transport on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Kuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The small hill-Joensu route is shortened to the route Piksämäki-Varkus.
On the routes Ríihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, the port of Kouvola-Kotka and Kajani-Oulu will be reduced.
More than half a million trips per year are made at layoffs, while the total number of journeys purchased by the supplier is approximately nine million.
The purpose of this agreement is to provide the State with annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman's book entitled "You Should Check With Marx" in the book Capital Issues.
The global economic crises have brought to light Karl Marx (18-18/1883) and his final work on Capital, published in 1867-1894, writes in a book published today by Yrjö Hakanen, the first President of GDP, in his book Marx's capital.
"He will now be taken more seriously than he has been for a long time", Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of the development, internationalisation and penetration of capital into all areas of life, the accumulation of capital and the growing role of money capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly distant.
The title of the book on the basis of the Capital Seminars is also published by Aalto University Professor, Appreciationd Economist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman, Marx writes of the current "now and forever."
Is not, however, a Marxist, the former Executive Director of the Department of Economic Research and the Committee of Economics?
Not at all.
Korkman says on the phone that he does not view Marx as an economic operator but rather as an interesting social theorist.
Today, social sciences are different and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator and literary expert.
"The general idea is that the staff is told of the wrong views of the men of the dead," Korkman begins.
It is true that Marx's predictions went seriously wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew too far-reaching conclusions from the early part of capitalism, my question by Korkman.
However, Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical attitude.
"The more relevant thing about Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
We are now discussing the interests of Marx again, such as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to those who want to understand a big picture, as a result of technical revolutions change the world", Korkman's analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thought that capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Again, Marx is in favour of studying Korkman’s opinion.
"The '70s Marx couldn't read," Korkman says.
"The Mao and Trotskys and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more so each other.
Today, the debate is more frequent, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weights of the years of the year to come.
"Every social scientist should get to know Marx's world of thinking - as in other classics," says Korkman.
urges war criminals to be judged in Sri Lanka.
Calls on the creation of a Special Court to investigate the war of war in Sri Lanka, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 was published on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as the Tamil tigers for the crimes of war.
In the Sri Lanka civil war, at least 100,000 people are estimated to have died.
There are no precise data on the number of victims.
Especially the major armed forces attack in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, the UN report calls for it.
The report by Sri Lanka’s armed forces blames torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as much as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have committed the coercion of bystanders and children as fighters.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to carry out an investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the United Nations Court of Justice because of foreign judges.
In the U.S. Yo-Test, it was possible to puntrate social media.
On Wednesday, the study of the autumn was in turn a long foreign language, most of which was English.
More than 16,000 volunteers tested their skills.
The test may have produced material from social media, for example.
Based on our experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
In the alternative, the English word 150-250 could be presented to the administrator of the web newspaper’s advisory column.
The weekend was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt corresponds to the rest chair in Leelia, Finland.
He had to ask how you should look at things also for young people.
The total number of subjects was four, of which one had to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," assesses the third subject in the English lecture Mia Lybeck of the Swedish-language high school in Porvoo.
The subject concerned only a tie from the former President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, on behalf of the European Commission.
The second point was, according to Lybeck, it was pretty nice.
That's where it was supposed to be a talk of why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least in our school we've been trained to write speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the whole experiment "small normal".
In the English or Swedish experiment, questions were asked about texts that included, for example, adaptation to climate change and processing of large amounts of data.
A certain amount of Russians (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The autumn articles will continue on a Friday, where another domestic test, whether Swedish or Finnish, will take place.
In upper secondary schools, the experiment is conducted normally, i.e. the expression of employees does not affect it.
The University Court of Justice invites the students to search the appropriate routes in time for an opportunity to reach a trial.
A period may also be granted if it can be demonstrated that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
In Oulu, a trade was struck with a gun at risk.
In Oulu, Wednesday morning a trade was struck in the town of Kello.
According to the police, the shooter had gone into dark places and a face-to-face commando shop.
The man is normal-celled and about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money.
This case is being investigated as a gross robbery.
The police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protestors in Helsinki - support teams from other parts of Finland.
The protest against the government's cuts decisions will block the City Centre on Friday, predict the police.
Up to tens of thousands of people may arrive as soon as a preliminary request is made.
The members of the SAK, Akava and RTD associations will meet at the Railway Agency at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of mind.
On the other hand, the task of the police at work is not only to carry out the alarm and other police activities, but also to ensure that the sense of self-expression is carried out.
The roads leading to the railway station shall be blocked from motor vehicles for a period of approximately 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed to enter the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi traffic will be routed from Kaisaniemi to the transport circle, from the west from the mainland to the mainland.
Is Rohin enough for the police force, Captain Seppo Kujala?
Well, for the time being, it looks like that's enough.
I do not take the position on matters relating to the work of a police officer.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is coming from other parts of Finland because of a demonstration.
There's no telling by a precise patrol officer.
"Somethin' is coming, but we're most likely doing well on our own," says Kujala.
The police call on you to avoid private cars in the centre of Helsinki this Friday.
Kujala considers that the worst traffic ticket extends from Hakaniemi to the center of the centre.
Expecting traffic is expected from the morning until the beginning of the evening.
With protestors arriving from other parts of Finland, Helsinki also has many order buses coming to Helsinki.
They shall not be allowed to the Railway Market.
Buses are basically going to be a little bit off-road.
The rest of the trip must then walk to the location of the demonstration," says Kujala.
The expression of mind also stops Helsinki’s public transport.
From the point of view of the politician, there is also a positive side here.
The issue of public transport flow, which is normally at hand in these large assembly meetings, will now be taken care of in part.
The organisers of the demonstration have informed the police that Helsinki may become tens of thousands of opposition to government economic policy.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary people working or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful," Kujala says.
Local demonstrations are also held on Friday throughout Finland.
In many ways, Perjanta's demonstration is exceptional - do you remember these varnishes and mental expressions?
In many ways, the great demonstration of the spirit of trade unions is interesting and unusual in many ways.
For example, there is no very good comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siiseinen, professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It is no wonder, however, that the ay movement protests.
If not, it would raise your hands in front of the government, says Siisinen.
A well-righted government has struck the fundamentals of the tradition of Finnish corporateism - and also the places that have been important for the development of Finnish welfare.
The government's strong grips are missing in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that ay-movement is actually trying to get on their knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has a place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday's demonstrations.
What is new is the sharp division that the demonstration of mind creates in the context that the ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
In November 1993, the unemployed who met across Finland showed their minds in the Parliamentary House.
If you're looking for a comparison to a Friday's demonstration, it could be a big picture of the unemployed, but it's a break-in from 1993," says Siisinen.
In the middle of the deepest depression organized by Murrourstai gathered a total of 20,000 unemployed people.
Esko Ahon (central) government collapsed from the labour market crisis to the second.
It was said that the relationship between the Government of Finland and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as in the Aho district government before.
Now the difference between the government and the ay movement may be even worse than in the time of Murrostorsta.
On the other hand, Finland is in power now, as far as I am concerned, the most important bourgeois government of Finland is ever, says Siisinen.
In this way, the present government coalition is still so interesting that it is so strictly right despite the speeches of the basic Finns.
At the time of the breakage there were certain elements of the old labour movement.
Several thousands of protestors are expected to arrive on Friday.
The expression of mind also stops public transport and possibly closes days and schools.
While the demonstration does not receive indivisible support from employees, it can become the largest for years.
Some 300 protests have been held in Helsinki each year in recent years.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the demonstrations by the Finnish Ay movement have been very calm - even though the way of doing things has been tougher in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations avoid conflict; they are law-abiding.
Thoughtmakers are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Siisinen.
However, new winds brought new winds in the late 1990s.
Thought culture changed.
EU membership nervous farmers to throw eggs and the police prepared to get the shit out of them.
The strike of judges lasted three months in 1998.
There were also visible strikes on pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
In the 1970s, metal and electrical lakes for metal and electricity in the 1970s.
The most important strike in the 1970s were a metal strike in 1971 and a power plant and electrical strike in 1977.
The Board of Governors took part in 70,000 metalmen.
The layoff was held on a proposal from the Conciliation Committee after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men received a 16% raise in wages and salaries.
The spring 1977 electricity strike lasted 49 days and caused power failure all over the country.
February, 1993.
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people met for the House of Parliament, many of whom were unemployed in the recession, to vote in favour of the work.
The firemen striked for three months in 1998.
The strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless it was the longest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999.
In 1994, policemen went into egg rain in protest against the EU by farmers.
"Siberia teaches, Europe quits," was one of the slogans.
Farmers caught tons of snow.
In 1999, too, the Helsinki EU Summit also led farmers to protest and to the flood of the grass palaces in front of the meeting place.
Nurses quit 19 May and 1995.
Nurses quit for about a month in 1995.
The first time they had been in a home in 1983.
The 1995 strike was coloured by a few deaths during the strike.
The threat was on strike and the rise of nurses in 2007.
In the end, the negotiations were speeded up by the threat of mass insurrection.
Doctors stopped by
"Doctors on strike - escape," was the slogan of strike doctors on strike in 2001.
The municipal health centre and hospital doctors' strike lasted five months and brought about a lively discussion on how the strikes could endanger the safety of the patient.
After the strike, the public sector raised the salaries of doctors.
Students moving in 2013
Some 5 000 students marched for academic support in Helsinki from the Secretariat to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out the background to the police of a refugee-filled Finnish truck.
The police have been asked by the police to assist the central criminal police in the investigation of the backgrounds of a refugee return registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped at the Asteroids near the German border by a truck with 42 refugees on board.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
Everyone was in good health when they were on the cold truck.
We've had an exchange of information with the police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are on site in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, some refugees travelling on a truck in Austria became more fatal than others.
At that time, all 71 passengers who were on board at the time apparently died by suffocation.
According to the Public Broadcasting, the truck is owned by a Finnish public limited company, according to the Public Broadcasting Company, which first reported on cooperation with the police.
The company operates, among other things, restaurant activities and its CEO is a foreign-based man, about 40 years old.
In Austria, two Iraqiisms have been arrested for the transport of human beings.
The escapee-wrecking captain, a former drug addict and a poignant businessman - the story of five smugglers.
The famous king of smugglers, the violent boat driver, the elegant missionary and the taxi driver who thinks he's a good guy.
These people, for example, are engaged in the transport of human beings into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola, at the University of Trento, and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci, have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers" and their book The Death Travel Office will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the compartments of human trafficking, submit proposals for solutions and introduce smugglers from different steps of the business.
HH records five of these.
I'm gonna get rid of them right away.
The Kerkenna Islands in the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunish people are heading for the summer to be taken there.
On behalf of their location, the islands are also excellent for smuggling, since the journey to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 kilometres.
For comparison: distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometers.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives in Emir, in the chain of the incinerator and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but it is more profitable for the fisherman to transport people.
It's been done by Emir's tiny, ten-metre-long woodwork hundreds of times already.
If you melt the boat, it'll contain 40 people.
One trip Emir will earn some EUR 8 000 after spending.
Emir has five assistants looking for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a vast number of Tunicans wanted to escape from restlessness.
The situation then calmed down until the refugee crisis caused it to rise again again.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Revenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
Food is given so that customers just and just survive.
The accommodation costs about 75 euros a night, and if the customer runs out of money in the middle of the night, that's their problem.
We're going to the water in mid-summer shorts. We're going to the water in mid-summer.
The first one is to be driven off the islands, then stop, wait a day and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
At times the sea is hard, and in waves up to 20 metres high, passengers cry and vomit.
At its destination, human cargo has been unloaded in half an hour and Emir leaves for his return trip.
Emir wants them to fear him.
That's why he beats up his clients and at least claims to beat the speakers to death.
He says in the book that when the police saw him once, he threw all his passengers over the edge and told them to swim on the island.
"I infiltrated clients one by one and threw them across the street," says Emir in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
According to his countrymen, he has to suspect this as a matter of urgency.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of them right now.
We need to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Normal cab driver
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bologna, Serbia.
His cab is not very good - the starter engine is drawing on the latest and it's seen the best day of its life.
However, the most important thing for Goran’s customers is that the taxi moves in general and that it moves towards the Hungarian border.
Boša is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
Near the village is the centre for asylum seekers, where families are mainly sent to families.
In the forests around the center, men travelling without themselves can stay in tents, ploughs and abandoned cars, which everyone has now managed to find or build.
The forest also includes families who have not submitted an application for asylum to Serbia for reasons or for another.
Some also stay in private homes, but it's a public secret.
Goran, among the forests, finds most of his customers.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans, the route requires a large number of cross-border crossings and weeks of walks in a difficult landscape, often mountainous and in the dark.
Coming back to the Bologna area, the hub of a large cargo of human beings, people are dying of death.
Goran's visitors are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he'll tell you in the book.
"They say the right time and that's enough", Goran praising.
According to him, the Africans are trying to tickle.
Goran doesn't like it.
The hulk of the hulk of the hulk of the hulk of the humbug throughout the way.
First, the price is agreed on, for example, EUR 300, then they'll lower it to 200, and then they'll offer 150.
Goran stressed that he was a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran tells you what he's doing at a cheaper price than the rest of us and spends less than €50 a visit to the Hungarian border.
There are three hundred miles of travel, most of which are comfortable on the highway.
They say that colleagues will request a three- or four-time price.
Goran deserves approximately EUR 50 000 per year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is quite a good year's income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis must not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the short paths and takes his guests a mile from the border.
Then he points to the right direction and hurdles away.
The work of the fairness of things at work.
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and that is not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where many believers fled the Congo, and a small centre where children refugees from Congo are helped by Congo.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from the Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It is important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and makes sure that the gauze of the white under the lower waist of the jeans is sneezing in a cheetah of the gauze of the white twigs.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, his country car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The customer will first call one of the five telephone numbers of the missionary’s five telephone numbers.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money in a viscera and slip it into a box of traders crossing the border.
In order to obtain the status of an asylum seeker or refugee, the Ugandan authorities need to be informed that they are from, for example, the North Kivu Military Territories and that they have had to flee from their homes for violence.
Often it is true, but if it is not, the missionary will arrange a new life for the customer.
The old identity card will be destroyed and another will be acquired.
That's how the Missionary's contacts with Ugandan police will be maintained.
After that, it will be directed where the right asylum seekers are going: the asylum procedure, the NGOs, finally the United Nations Organisation for Asylum in the UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has come to Uganda as a fugitive himself.
He invoices each port separately: submitting an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, providing documents to the humanitarian organisation about 150, and the migration process, for example, for one European country between EUR 4 500 and 7 000.
Foliot and ice pieces.
Tom is an instigating smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A 40-year-old Irish patrolling on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into cargoes travelling to Britain.
He's got an Afghan, French taxi driver in London, and ten truckers who may not even know they're in the traffic of human beings.
At night Tom and the cab driver picked up their customers, usually 2-3 people, somewhere near the center of Calais.
They drive a highway to A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison for organising illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting on drugs for seven years.
Taxi stops, Tom runs over customers' freeways to a resting place where drivers sleep before continuing to cross the canal across the Britts.
The choice of a suitable truck must be made sure that it is going to England, not perhaps the Netherlands, and cut off the safety gear of the protective shield.
It must be done silently so that drivers do not wake up.
A driver is on the run, but then the run is more expensive.
The route is clear, Tom wrapped his customers in a aluminum foil, similar to the one wrapped in the kitchen around a pastry or oven potato.
It should prevent police heat scanners from detecting a hider.
It is common to use frozen sleeping bags filled with ice for that purpose.
Tom leaves his customers in the truck and leaves the place with the hope that he will not run for the long-distance smugglers, at least before Britain.
King of the smugglers
Muamer Küèuk is one of the world's most famous human transporters.
Uporical Turkish law has been called the Master of Marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal uprisings of the Mediterranean, who manages maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Kyle has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has one competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he's just asking for the money.
One of the new methods is a luxury shipwreck: a Turkish port is rented for pleasure, as if to export US or European families to a few days' tourist tours.
In reality, ships are loaded to a full extent by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans transporting from Istanbul to Europe at EUR 5 000-7 000 first from Istanbul.
Customers will be kept in animal storage, such as old industrial farms, until it is time for them to leave.
People go to minibuses and drive somewhere along the coast.
They are encouraged to hide among the environment and to wait for a mark.
When it is given, it is necessary to board the ship quickly.
Passengers must keep their entire journey under the deck hidden.
The Security Council can only observe how far the ship is swimming, as other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers out and throw up, the better.
The kük will receive about 53 000 euros of one luxury ship after spending.
He does not do the practical things himself, but hires the captains, recruiters, guards, hosts and other minor factors to carry out the work on his behalf.
At least hundreds of shipments will be held during the summer and millions will be made by Kyçük.
He is expected to have bought through undercover companies through country, pharmaceutical companies and over 100 housing he rents.
Muamer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish representative of the Democratic Party and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he seems to have disappeared.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10: The Death Travel Office book will appear here, not next week.
The book on its disease and its becoming a prostitute tells us about the American Olympics in its book on its disease and its formation as a prostitute.
The new book by Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1 500-metre runner, competed at the Olympics three times, has attracted attention to the United States.
Favor Hamilton, in his book Fast Girl, tells of ending and running his career into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published a summary of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton made his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competitions in peak condition and ran out for the second best time in the field.
However, in the finals, he went down.
He rushed to the top at first and defended his leadership on the ground run.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his powers were lost.
He collapsed into the surface of the track, and other competitors passed him one after the other.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I forced myself over the finish line, Favor Hamilton, in his book.
Later, it turned out that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bilateral mood disorder.
His brother Dan had made a year before I raced to commit suicide, and he himself felt tremendous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The county had no economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money from having sex with strangers.
He also overtook his husband to accept his actions.
The Favor Hamilton taxi was EUR 450 per hour.
He tells me he's spent his money on luxury.
One of Favor Hamilton's explanations of the prostitution was also that he needed the same adrenaline peaks as he had been able to compete in public sport.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was suffering from a bilateral mental disorder.
The life of a former star drunk came to light at the end of 2012, when Smoke Gun published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 metres away at the time of world statistics at 3.57.40, but remained last in the Olympic finals in the Baltic Sea.
The master of the world was amazed when the alliance set the Norwegian ski trail by "direct-backed".
The Norwegian skiing king Petter District has crossed the limits of convenience for at least one of its colleagues.
Aug and the Norwegian Ski Union have turned the whole summer and autumn into the ordinary sports agreement last year.
Even though the Union has offered Pigug a better agreement than other athletes, it has not been good enough for the multi-time world and the Olympic winner.
The outcome of the dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and the Northug decided to close the future season out of the world cup.
The decision received thanks to the double-worlder Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the alliance was running a ski shift.
"Thank you for showing me the backbone," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the Union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Union and the Northug is about money.
Magug could seem to be part of the season of the national team so that he could promote his own sponsorship.
Jacobsen said he was happy to look after a union that will also look after future generations and will not let one of the athletes in his solos.
He also reminded us that the Union has given the region both economic and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has a different rules than just because he's the best.
The Northug published his own press release on Tuesday, confirming that he would like to be sports in Norwegian colours next season in the world cup as well as then in the World Cups and the Olympic Games.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, two gold medals, in total.
He was involved last winter in Falun in a team that won the media bill.
The stamp translators’ Thursdays are also due to be held in the Nordic countries.
On 25 September on the 25th day of the day there will be stamps at various restaurants and stores that have been awarded the Paste Converter shield.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food expertise and to lower the threshold for departure to the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
I would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but high-level restaurants, which are controlled and classified by an impartial operator, are located all over Finland.
The first point received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of turtle restaurants and the organisation.
In Ostrobothnia, the day is held in Vaasa in the restaurant Foundation and Kantarel.
In October, the Old Town Restaurant participates on Thursday.
The event has also received significant international attention.
The event has been decided to make the organisation one of the most important international events to take place in the same day on a world-wide scale.
Finland will continue to be the host country of the event.
Kauhaki magazine: Appealed to the Chancellor for the establishment of a Kauhava reception centre.
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre at the premises of the Kauhava ex-burden, now owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, the region continues to operate permanently in the critical infrastructure of the banker, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Separate Networks Oy.
According to a private person, investing in the same building would constitute a major safety risk, which has not been taken into account in the preparation of the matter.
According to the complainant, defence forces may have an interest in the region and airport of the former Aviation School, the impact of which has also not been clarified in the preparation of the reception centre, the paper writes.
In the case of the Kahorava field, negotiations have been held for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator at the airport.
This issue has been discussed, inter alia, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistön (p.p.) and Secretary General Arto Rädy, Ministry of Defence.
The staff member shall inform the Registrar that the complaint is not a question of the principle of opposition from the reception centre, but of the wrongness of the planned location in the former guard area.
The Board of Directors of the Board of Directors dealt with the reception centre last Monday.
Soil: The situation in Syria is reflected in the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region.
The Board of Directors means that immigrants and those who are here have the necessary circumstances, Niinistö comments in the evening to journalists after meeting with the Presidents of all Parliamentary Parties in his office in Mäntyniemi.
According to the President, a concern about the management of the refugee situation was brought together by all the participants.
He welcomes the fact that Finnish government and opposition parties in Finland are able to discuss the fundamentals in confidence.
In these days, when we face great challenges, we will face great challenges.
According to the League, the situation in Syria, as well as the activities of Russia and the United States in the region, can also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, in the Baltic Sea region.
The silencing is a hope for the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, namely the United States and Russia, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the still tension in the Baltic Sea situation.
According to the League, the Nato issue was also ignored in discussions.
The president of the Bureau did not take a position.

Researcher: Sipilä is taking a high risk.
According to Sipilä, communication requires a wide range of channels, and the Prime Minister's telephone and cell phones are one channel among others.
This direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This is not going to stay for the last time, Sipilä said reporters in the Parliament.
The pig did not yet want to assess how often the repeated method of the Prime Minister's telephone and mobile phone calls would become.
According to the wingman, talks may not always be broadcast on Yle's network in the future.
If other channels turn up as a channel, we'll see about that.
Here's what we're doing here tonight, Sipilä said.
According to the citizen, Finland’s economic situation is so serious that it requires that the public be given a telephone and a mobile phone.
This issue, which is now being discussed, is quite complicated and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up on this channel, Sipilä clear.
The speech will be sent from 21.05 to 21.20 p.m. in both TV1 and Radio Finland.
It can also be seen in Yle Areena.
He's taking a big risk.
The researcher hopes that Sipilä's phone will not tell you about a more general introductory approach to the government.
Is it an attempt to impose the right of public debate on the right of self-sufficiently and to refuse to hold a public debate on the arrangements for questions? asked Professor Anu Koivänen of the University of Stockholm.
Recalls the recent comment by the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin on the fact that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow himself to define it.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters are not related.
Koiväen understands that commercial media has been repugnant by Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of political decision-makers are not reporting issues in democracy.
It is the responsibility of the media to make a definite effort to ensure that the agendas of politicians are not taken on board.
According to Kalivä, the phone is a big risk for Sipilä.
In his speech, he should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations made to him.
Is there any more we've heard available today?
Or is he able to talk to a different tone, in a different way or in a different way or to say or say something new?
Kikikönen says that if there is only more of the same age in the permit, you have to wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an extraordinary time.
In this context, the Yle will take the risk, if this is not a particular situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labelled as a communication between politicians or Parliament and the government, which is certainly not in the interest of Yle or in the general line.
From the point to the point of view, the point of reference shall be taken into account.
What the Prime Minister fails to say will also be important in the future talk of the citizen, the media researcher will stress.
In the evening you should look closely at where Sipilä is missing and where she is not, says Heikki Heutti, research director at Jyväskylä University.
According to the moon, TV is a clever bet from Sipipi, because this is how this can bring out its own views without sounding sores.
This will provide the general public with no journalistic filter, unlike at a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The blade passes the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will interpret something wrong about the speech, because precise questions will not be asked.
According to the moon, it is very important to see how Sipilä is on TV - pouring sweat, shaking hands.
He's comparing Sipilä with the father figure, who's now telling the people what to do.
If you know how to do this well, it can work.
The situation is different from that if the government knew something about it, because it is as if it is talking directly to another person.
Obama and partners regularly take care of (US President Barack) Obama and its partners.
Very exceptional.
Politician Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to be a real exception to the public.
According to him, it has not happened for decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
An exceptional period of time requires exceptional means," Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister thus wishes to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmailes ahead.
Employees' organisations are organising a protest and strike against government action on the line.
President of the United Left, Paavo Arhimäki, says that Sipilä could give his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would also be the subject of discussion.
Antti Rinne (sd.) President of the SDP once again announces that he will respond to the Sipilä dialogue.
We don't have time for guerrillas now.
Soon six months from the elections.
You can't hide in endlesss, Rinne is writing.
The son who was 9 years old has been on the run and has been found in Shera on the basis of a 19-year-old runaway.
The boy was in good condition at the time he was found.
THE BOY IS WRONG AND AS IT IS, the son's father posted to his Facebook page.
The internal Finnish police department will also confirm the case for the evening newspaper.
The kid went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later on, he was not contacted again.
Father thank all those who have helped in the search for him.
Thank you for your tenuous contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer than 15,000 times that is an incredible balance in such a short period of time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent wildness of the young: You can accomplish it.
Makwan Amirkhani, a curated freerist, published a video on Facebook, which appeals in particular to young people with an immigrant background.
Makwan Amikhani spoke out hard against the street fights of the people.
Amikhani, born in Iran and who arrived in Finland at the age of five, has won both of his trades in the most prestigious UFC series of free competitions.
My agency tells me they received a message asking you to check out a Instagram account.
Videos have been uploaded to the account where young people fight with extremely violent grips.
My Amiga reports that she is disappointed with the wildness of young people.
Amirkhan 26-year-old has over 62 000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick in the ground, sit on the other side, and unmistakably beat without any of these consequences, which is what happens when you make these videos, my Amikhan updates.
Harder to defend any more.
Some of the young people seen in the video are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, the fight videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young Finns.
The fact that you two are fighting on the street at all.
You are making the lives of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, reminds me of the Turkish Amikhani.
My Amilahan reminds us that there are sites in Finland that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
There have been quite a lot of specific cases.
A little bit, boys, he's defending you again.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for quite some time.
That's a little different from thanking you for being here, my Amikhan says.
My Amiga invites young people to remember their nearness.
If they ever get involved in some kind of racism, you're gonna have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think a couple of times before you go along with him like that, guys.
My Amilahan says that violent action is a bet on racism.
You're making me hate what I don't even know.
You've got things pretty bad, and you're not going to cure them at all, amikhan will decide.
SAK places its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday.
Lauri Lyly, Chairman of the SAK, tells us that on Monday the employees' organisation will question its position on the alternative savings proposed by the KIC.
Lauri Lyly's comment on the proposal for a TSI is on-line.
The staff organisation STK reported earlier on Wednesday that it would present to the Board its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central).
President-in-Office Sture Fjäder believes that the Board will accept the proposal if SAK, RTD and the Plan are all behind the proposal.
However, this would require the largest wage-remuneration organisation SAK to soften its position.
Lauri Lyly, President of the SAK, on behalf of the President of the SAK, commented on the matter in a vague way.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this issue on Monday.
According to Lyly, SAK is looking for solutions to "open the labour market lock" and that instead of capping, agreements between active parties are needed.
Lyly recalls that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement by the Government of Sipilä was not valid for the SAK.
In the past, Sipilä broke negotiations on a social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the 5% productivity target.
Comment: The threat of being impressed with the feeling of a big smile is, "I feel it's a little bit silly to stick your fist".
I hear it's a little silly to stick a fist, if there's already a nice paper in the pocket, write Pekka Tiinanen.
The atmospheres vary from side to side in a pay camp.
Is it meant to call the government on the ground or to agree with it?
On Monday, the SAK's Deputy Directors broke out the sacred minister to the government of the kingdom.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to those who wanted to do so.
OAJ threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ canceled: none of the schools or day-care centres will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), Chairman of the STKI, was represented in an amicable manner by the Staff Office Organisation (STK) on behalf of the STK.
He announced that he had made contact with the government and that he would draw up an alternative proposal requested by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) for a 5% rate of output.
Mr Sture Fjäder (kok) was quick to announce immediately that his piece of paper had already been completed.
First of all, there was no word from SAK's office.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree when the Vice-Presidents asked the country to stand down on Monday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would look for solutions to "open the labour market lock".
In order to produce a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept a 5% productivity target.
Nothing is that the Palola RTD maintains its relations with the Government of Sipilä.
Jukka Iguus, the right hand of the Palace, was formerly Special Assistant to the Central Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen and Mari Kiviniemi, who was responsible for the social impact of the RTD.
As a result, the fire said that the government's ay-skilling has gone out all the time.
Rain or no rain, but Palola's entry took off the floor from Finnish waiters, who were drawn by the AA Marko Pialainen (sd).
I'm telling you, it's a little silly to stick a fist if there's already a nice paper in the pocket.
Modify at 18:00: Added information about Lynn's comments.
The meeting called Finland a bad father: "This must not happen".
Russian President Sergei Naryshkin criticises the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
In the view of the President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, the Russian President, Mr Sergei Naryshkin, is a better OSCE host than Finland.
In the capital of Ulan Batori, Ulan Batori, the OSCE's parliamentary assembly has begun indictment at which Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July summit in Helsinki.
So Finland did not allow Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who were forced to come to a meeting of the European Union - a matter on which the President took note of a reminder from the journalists.
According to our report, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and to the principles of open dialogue.
This can't happen again, Naryshkin printed the news office according to Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticisms were directed at the United States, where his access was not only prevented.
Sanktions are committed suicide from the EU, Naryshki reported.
So Naryshkin continued his visit to Finland with praise and praise for "a remarkable organization" by the Russian delegation in Myanmar, and Narysh also continued his visit to Finland.
I am sure that the joint assembly will be conducted in a constructive and positive way - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The management understands that there should be no obstacles to the parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (cok), the leader of the Ulan Bator meeting, who, according to the press, has already discussed Russia's delegation with Russia.
The lock meets the real playoff cover: "You're up tight".
Hits and Lõk will continue today in Hakamets with bullheads while they'll be on fire on the second day of the day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in Hakamets there will be no real goal parties to see today.
Patpara went to Kuopio last night to dig up 3-2 and get a job at Kalpa.
The rise was clever, because last month's silver team was at its worst two goals' loss position.
The lock on Tuesday was better than the cell phone win.
The guest of the Rauminen catch of the starter Blues, who took part in the game, was a round zero point, and the loss figures are also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any play the same game as last year, lock-out Janne Lahti is expecting to set up with the club's pages.
The killing has become a fairly playoff nightmare on the rams.
During the previous period, Tappara has just dropped out of the Lock finals in the middle of the second round.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, Lõkko took a series to the end of the fourth game, but Tappara rose in three next side and passed.
There are no major changes in the composition of the groups except for paint guards.
The cashiers who fought both of them last night are getting a party today.
At the target of the kill Mika Noonen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the Lõk poles, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View: In the middle of the day, a terrible play is under way.
Director of Sport Võola's manuscript was written by Head Coach Rautakallio in an inappropriate extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen in Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stallone wrote a Rocky film in which he himself played the main part.
The opening officer sensationalally set up a series of activities for Apollo Creed, the world’s world’s heavyweight world’s Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a great deal of sympathy, even though he eventually lost his title.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola scripted the restless ashtray in the Pori.
The nameless and sturdy pottery went all the way to the MS finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous, but tough, bottom-up defendants like Rocky.
There was a great Indian, Pori Matt and Pelto.
In the playoffs, the players dyed their heads red and cut off the licorices.
It's true, it's true. It's true.
JP Jalo, the speaker of the TV, called the coach Neumann.
The aces took the buttery silver.
Reala was one of the heroes.
The author, Mr Óla, believes that this period's new work works in the same way as it did six years ago.
The man who works as the sports manager of the guerrillas has built a pot on the bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amors and Josh Gratton have been mutilating trails around the neck like Rocky’s pig carcases in the yard.
The benefits of Masi Marjamäe, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparise are in something other than the play of the reel.
Alula has forgotten that at Rocky VI the main part of the show is Pekka Rautakallio.
The Kirri Stone has crossed the Sean Connery of Rautakallion.
In the context of the script written by Toivola, Rautala is as clumsy as the principal author of the main part of Connery as it would have been in the original of 1976.
There's nothing else on the rave than a nickname.
The play philosophy of the irony does not include rushing and small-scale translation.
He likes to play hard, but there's a different thing about playing hard as a pig.
Last month, the Ässien Garret Stafford was holding the Tapparan Jee from the Karelian head.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute.
All we have is those who deserve to play is those who play.
I don't accept that kind of game and it's not part of the holocaust, it's hot in Rautakallio agitated after the game to the people of Satakunia.
This season's team is obviously built up.
There are jerks, veterans, police and obsessives.
At the best age of the game, no key players exist in practice.
No wonder the head coach has chosen the skill equivalent.
How much have you been able to influence gaming, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last year's events involve procurement and, unfortunately, the situation on the market was rather narrow, Rautakallio answered diplomaticly.
Surface under the accessories.
In the 1953st century, Rautakallio is known to be interested in becoming a sports boss at the Toivola site.
Men's contracts will end in the spring.
The balance in the three leagues of the season is equal to the number of losses on paint difference 1-6.
I don't think that's the point where I should've written the script.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa's mother too.
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband, Katka, as a teenager, you would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the guidance of his husband.
Yes, I'm doing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, an actor and producer Olga Temonen's laugh.
He has been married to an ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have worked a lot together before, but now Olga is acting for the first time under the control of Võlka.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulanto's You're a beautiful movie of us is the drumming mother of Sipe Santa.
A sickle tsamp and supports his son, even though his father Risto (who is represented by Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be the voice of reason.
The more I have met my true example of Sirkka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to the Flash that he trusted me with the role.
Olga had met Sirka before the project, but since then the two have drawn much closer.
They've met, talked on the phone and called.
The chip has helped a lot.
We've been going through a lot of different angles throughout their history.
Fortunately, I'm also aware that drama is drama, and the reality may need a little colour.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only person in Heinola who blindly believed that Helpla will become the largest in Finland.
There was a recession in the '90s, and it was a real duck.
There was quite a chance that someone would actually succeed, but Sirkka had some kind of instinct, and he was right.
Olga tells me that she had heard a lot from the Frog about this young man before he was planning a project.
However, the stories of parents have sometimes been very different.
Yes, if you are a 15-year-old teenager, how many people really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that her own youth was completely different from that known as Heinola's infamous skateboarder.
Olga was a everyday girl and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Froga.
At most, he could have hidden a crush.
According to Olga, for 10 years he has worked so closely with Mr. Hokka that a big joint project is not afraid.
Everything's always gone super after.
Now the entire production group will go to Heinola for a month.
Although a couple living in the village plan to drive home at night because of their little children, too, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take the whole Heinola for a month.
They have truly welcomed us, asked only what streets and when to empty.
Iron Sky 2 began to become Finland's most expensive drama film in Finland.
The budget for the Iron Sky film, directed by the Érosola, is EUR 17 million.
The photographs will begin in October in Belgium.
Director Timo Vuorensola is starting to film Iron Sky 2 in October in Belgium.
Scifi film Iron Sky's extension, Iron Sky: The Combing Race, will be the most expensive drama in Finland all the time with its 17 million Euro budgets.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland has been Jalmar Helander's Big Game.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation will rise as soon as it is completed also by Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is more than EUR 100 million.
The pictures of the film directed by TERO Nõrensola and produced by Tero Farkomaa will begin in October at Aed Studios, near Antwerp, and will last for eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium already next week.
The giant budget is not afraid.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm so relaxed in the file script because I know exactly what movie should be like.
Everyone in the work group seems to realize that something unprecedented is going to be done.
It's great to go to Belgium.
As long as time is tight, there is no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited about it, and I can't wait to be shown to the audience of this movie, and she'll tell Evening News.
The original film budget was estimated at 8-10 million, but the budget also increased as the script developed.
The budget is big, but it's a big shot, too.
However, 100 million people should be involved in the film, because each aspect and effect are so expensive.
Now it's all turned so tight, there's nothing missing.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched on Wednesday a mass finance campaign and a bond with an annual interest rate of 4-8%.
The final charge will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
At the latest two years after that, the company shall repay the loan.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junts or cools?
Big bugs come back to their shirts.
Recently, the major logos have been harvested by the trended fronts.
A while ago, a fashion-conscious erect was waiting for clear and big logos like Crochea to match the console.
The promotion of a hood or T-shirt was seen as a bit of a jerk.
The times change.
Sport has become the right megatrand of fashion, and so have the old, familiar sports fashion characters, such as Adidas and Nike, rose onto the wave of coolness.
And so often, first of all, the bounds of fun and trendy are astounding: if something is right, it begins to turn into ironic and cool.
At first, the norm core trend, i.e. the tavis fashion, in which the trend setters maintained as much as possible the most boring basic clothing as a way of separating from mass.
Now on top of the gray base college, instead of putting on the bottom of the catcher, you'll have to put on the net shirt that looks like the manufacturer's logo in front of it.
The bigger and better, the better.
In addition to the logos, Adidas, for example, is identified by track network software, the favorite team’s toy shirts and New York Yankee flags have made a return to the street fashion.
The bottom edge of the balconies is starting to be rocked by the Calvin Klein logos, which are now cool in detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sport brands to luxury brands as well.
For example, the front of Versace’s cynical extremities makes clear what the illustrious clothing is about.
Would you be ready to introduce a logo in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence: I was not stuck in the tank hatch for hours!
According to the claims, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, the Russian producer of military products, was held 2015.
Over the past few days, there have been colourful claims in the media that the Russian Security Department was forced to remove large-scale Zotov from the tank hatch for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to challenge the data.
He even published on his own public website a picture of how he appears to be sneezing about the brow of a armored vehicle in very good moods, and at least based on their images, it's not about being stuck or angry at all.
Total nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in the battle tank, but it was BMP 3.
I myself am a former soldier, Colonel, I have served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, and Zotov said Komosomolskaja Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
In the exhibition, Zotov, on the Russian military TV channel, expressed his admiration for Russia's new technology, because he himself is a former professional soldier.
I was interested in what was inside the wagons, and I was fascinated by our technique.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
In the following exhibition, I will definitely visit all tanks and all attack tanks, Zotov promised.
Hotov also called the supplier responsible a fool's ass.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing there.
I went in and came out.
I'm tall and ratty, but something about being stuck in a tank somewhere didn't happen, he said to the Russkaya sluzhba novostei radio.
Zotov's words are supported by the fact that no photographs of the alleged crissiness have been published, even though a total of 50,000 people were present at the arms exhibition over a few days.
The claim that Zotov got stuck started on the Bloknot.ru site where Zotov was told that he was hanging out of the tank hatch while trying and finally shooting everyone around if he didn't get out of the surface.
The Bloknot website later published a further story in which the exhibition organisers shared their views on what happened.
Everyone is just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armored vehicles.
Mr Zotov, due to his large size, was simply delayed when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said the director of the exhibition Aleksandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

There has been a leak in the Kittilä mine of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The grubbing-up process water has been leaked from the so-called liquefying sand pool into the stream.
According to the operator, measures to correct the bleeding have been started.
There is a foaming process neutralised enrichment sand and purified process water in the pool.
In general, water will either be pumped for re-use as a process medium or driven through the surface light field into the environment, in accordance with the authorisation.
The leak was estimated to be approximately 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the operator, the quality of the leak water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
The rest of the substance did not pass into the environment.
The leak was detected on a checkup on Monday morning.
The leakage has not been caused by structural damage to the tank structure.
The Agency shall inform the Agency of any close cooperation with the authorities with a view to monitoring and correcting the situation.
The mine employs about 6 hundred permanent workers.
Dansken Kuoppa Mountain: IMF warns against cutting too much.
The Finnish Country Report, published today by the IMF, is largely following the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organization set out structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime and paid holidays would support Finland’s competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contractual system and for protection of the environment.
According to Mr. Pasi Kuoppamäe, the main economic owner of the bank, Mr. Bank, we agree on structural reforms, but there are also few differences.
The IMF estimates that there is a great deal of positive message for government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
These include, for example, the sale of infrastructure, Kuoppamäki tells Äessanom.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects would also be in favour of implementing as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
IMF is forecasting a 0.4 per cent growth rate for Finland this year, which will increase to 0.9 per cent next year.
Today, in its new cyclical forecast, Danske is predicting growth to be zero this year.
IMF is a bit more optimistic this year.
They may have had the basis for the latest observations.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported a small increase in total output in summer, reports Kuopopamäki.
Less attention has been paid to the deterioration of industrial confidence or other so-called softer measurements.
However, these differences only concern a few per cent of the decimal places.
Nintendo, who was recovering from death, appointed a new leader.
Tatsumi Kimishima, working under Saptor Iwata, who died of cancer in July, starts work on Wednesday, Nintendo reported on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the game industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the launch of a genuine Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Itata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to monitor Iwata's footprints, assesses Ace Research's analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to involve Nintendo strongly in mobile games, but in such a way that it does not eat company bread on the side of traditional artificial consoles.
More and more underage asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone.
Already in February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Service acknowledged that hundreds of children who have come to the country will disappear annually.
This has been reported, among other things, by OSF.se and Dagens Nyheter on their website, according to the Swedish Immigration Service, hundreds of underage applicants disappear each year.
Juha Kanelma, Chief Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear less than a year?- A total of 156 applications for asylum for a single underage in Finland were made in 2013.
They lost nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196 and 11 of them disappeared.
The disappearance may result from the fact that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying for the Dublin Regulation and may have been found to be of full duration there.
In such cases, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and to be returned to the country responsible for the processing of the application.
Similarly, some of the missing persons will also be found later when they apply for asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, 134 of whom a decision was taken on the application because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so the missing adult asylum seekers during the last 123 years, he says.
The growth rate?
By 6 September of this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum for a single minor.
Overall statistics on underage asylum seekers that have disappeared this year are not yet available, but the number of underage applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons.
What difference does it make?
Do they also include, for example, "the black labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police are responsible for the implementation of the conversion decisions, the Ombudsman stresses the emphasis.
Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (cok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered applicants.
He has taken action on this matter.
On Monday, the Orpo, who was discussing the issues of asylum at the EU-Secretary, reported on the issue of practical measures for managing the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkone is selling Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of devices.
As a result of medical incidents, the equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen, a media pioneer who lost his job, for TV and radio production is now available for sale.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells in Huuto.net equipment that was once the most advanced professional tools in its range.
The first thing about the online announcement was the website's press release on the Internet.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind in technological development.
In the digital media world, television programmes for Betacam tapes are no longer described.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there will be interest in her.
The system is, of course, no longer up-to-date in this way, but they are also needed as long as there is a material of an old generation that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs - collectors and personal studio builders, Nina Mikkonen wonders about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos are trying to move away from the current stormland home.
There's no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've just started to inquire and see what things are being given up.
At this point I started," Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no private use for TV and mobile devices anymore.
It is clear from recent heart attacks that a man who has worked a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now all we sell is goods and equipment.
Timo T.A. Mikkonen’s actual life work was archived already in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, which was visited by representatives to collect films and other material from Storsky.
The threat of transport is worse than expected: Metro and trams can stop all over again.
Metro and tram drivers today decide whether to expand their efforts to deal with a series of protests.
The original plan was to stop metro and tram traffic only on Friday during a demonstration.
During the afternoon, it is clear whether traffic will stop all day.
Chief Commissioner Pekka Horvonen says that the threat is large in the field.
The night and shift cuts are a lot of drivers, so the government's plans for cutting the cord are a source of resistance.
The horror wondered, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If metro and trams stop for a short time, public transport in the capital region will be almost entirely at a stop.
According to VR data, trains will not be running between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. by Friday.
There will be no intermodal or long-distance traffic on Fridays.
Trains leaving before noon will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses remain in the barn.
ACP members are absent from work on Friday morning from 3 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the authorities of the HSL, by Pirkko Repo, the editor of the HSL.
Repo says that HSL is not able to tell exactly which bus shifts are going on Friday.
Employees' organisations will organise a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Tower on Friday from 11-13 p.m.
Aftonlade: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees for tear gas.
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the border between Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to reach Europe, reports the press agency AP.
According to News News, refugees have tried to cross the border gate.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled under the influence of a panic.
According to the public media, the Hungarian police should also have used water cans against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas, where the teacher thought that a self-made watch was a bomb.
In the United States of America, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested after the teacher considered his school-school self-intended watch as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted nothing more than to show the output of his electronics career.
However, one of the teachers thought the clock was like a bomb.
The police were called in and the situation ended with the boy being taken in handrails to the police detention cell.
In any event, Mohammed has not been found to have claimed anything other than that he had made a clock.
However, it is still possible that the boy is accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had believed that the clock had appeared to be "movie bomb".
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of a clear circuit board and a digital display between which there were wires.
The incident took place last Monday and Mohammed was punished for three days on probation from school.
His father is upset about the incident, and the U.S. Islamic Council was wondering if there was another demonstration of Islamphobia in the United States.
The president of the United Kingdom - Labour refused to sing a national song.
In a song, God is called upon to protect the Queen, but Corby is the opponent of the Monarchy.
The criticism made by the right-wing press has also included representatives of the Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has hurt the people, thinking that the Labour Representative Kate Green was a public broadcaster at the BBC radio interview.
Green thinks that Corbyn should have joined the song.
At yesterday's memorial ceremony, the British Air Force pilots were in charge of fighting the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
In his opinion, the Labour Party defends Corby and stresses that he has paid tribute to the visitors by participating in the event.
We are all in great debt of gratitude to the sovereignty of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with reverence during the national assembly, and the opinion was highlighted.
The choice of Corbyn as the president-in-chief has divided the rows of the laboratory.
Especially among the MPs are those who fear to banish his moderate voters with their radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral disarmament, the end of saving operations and the completion of public expenditure.
For the first time today, Corbyn is scheduled to appear in the chair of the President-in-Office at the Prime Minister's Question Time in Parliament for the first time.
Corby has asked the public about what Mr. David Cameron should be asked about.
Cameron took over the election of Corbyn as the president at the weekend.
The working party is threatening national security, economic security and the security of our families, and the Prime Minister has referred to you in his own account.
The cause of the family death in Minnesota is still unclear - the father of the family was waiting for a trial.
The South Lake Kustonka Police have been investigating the death of a family in Minnesota Greenwood for a week soon.
Five families were found dead at home on September 10th, and a few days later, the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, bru igh short, 45.
First, after shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead already days.
A family was found after being concerned about the absence of a child in school.
According to this announcement, the police went to the house to check-in and killed the Shorti family dead from all over the massive house.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
The millions of houses and a successful company.
The case of South Lake Kustonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still under investigation.
The motives of bloods are still unclear.
Shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property at the social media site AllNures.com, which is aimed at nurses.
In 2014, at the StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors on the site every week.
I've had 50 bids made for my company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that in 2011 the Short Family bought a loony house in Greenwood for $2 million.
The house is advertised on a real estate site in Zillow for a car collector’s dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also eight garages sufficient for eight cars.
The case is pending.
According to StarTribune, however, the father of the family was waiting for a trial.
Achieve Test Prep, who offered different course courses, had sued him for comments on AllNures.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, there had been no exclusion from the Short site from the pre-selections, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the court would have had a very significant impact on Short's transactions.
Vesku Loiri offered us some cake coffee.
In addition, the three of them were awarded the Finnish Horse Owner Award for the month in Hippus.
This is great, Loiri comments on his generous tour.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned a profit of EUR 100 000.
The artist, Loiri, was still confused about the success of Fabrice Duo in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the coach of the defeat horse, Korpi, gets full work peace working with the horse.
The number of seats and the number of horses to be taken to compete with.
And I'll keep my mouth shut, Loiri rattle.
The amazing gesture of the NHL star - "The greatest gift ever made by an athlete"
Canadiens Star P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (about EUR 6.7 million) to the hospital of the children of Juti.
According to the hospital report, this is the largest single donation made by a sportsman of all time to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital with other funds for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract worth eight years and 72 million dollars a year ago with Canadiens.
Thus, the amount of the subban contribution is significantly higher than its nine million dollar annual amount.
For his donation, Subban will receive an open space bearing his name from the hospital.
Canadiens players have at least helped local hospitals significantly before.
Long-term Captain Jean Belveau, who passed away a year ago, collected millions of dollars for, among other things, the same children's hospital and Saku Koivu collected a huge sum of money for another city's major hospital, which provided the PET scanner needed for cancer research.
You can order your wife for dinner from the coffee in the front of the coffee shop, serving food on just a bikini and an essu.
The theme coffees are tough in Japan.
There's already a goat coffee on the market, a cane coffee, a vampire coffee, a fish coffee and now a wife coffee.
It hits the lonely, the feeling of association and the hunger of the hungry.
About the news, Metro.
From the Tokyo Ore no Yome (my wife) coffee, you can order a wife or husband for dinner.
It's a waitress pretending to be a customer's partner.
The "half" is selected from the list before coming to the cafe, and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is faced with just an essay and a bikini on top of her, and the husband is on a straight bike tour again.
The website provides you with all the information you need about the length and weight of your wife, always as to what kind of mattress they prefer to sleep on.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: the attacks on road data security have begun to be equipped for attacks against road security.
In addition, the Automated Security Review Board (ASRB) supports technological development and innovation in this field, and the Intel bulletin will be reported.
The city is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cyber safety solutions and products.
At the same time Intel published the first version of best practices on cybersecurity.
In future, the future will update the report on the basis of the ASRB’s research results.
The International ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimated that by 2020 around 150 million vehicles in the transport sector have been connected to the network.
Rare things are more precious than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles are able to consume, create and share online data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars," says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an essential component of the design of each car connected to the network.
Rare things are more interesting than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB panel the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world’s leading innovators in information processing.
Ford Focus RS pays approximately EUR 52 000 in Finland.
The Ford Focus RS model has been expected for years as the moon rises.
Finally, the car is starting to be in view in Finland too.
Ford released RS information now that the eyes of the car world are at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition.
Ford's new four-wheel RS is accelerated by its 2,3-litre, 350-cloud engine in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and peak speed is 2.6 km/h.
In Finnish, the price is also interesting, initially reported to be EUR 52 000.
The car is already available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you in his newsletter.
The favorite mark Kia introduced two new brands - the new Sportage and Optima - at the Frankfurt Car Exhibition.
A new fourth-generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to capture the ever-greater wings of the ever-growing street country market, will certainly be more important in Finland than two new new ones.
The new Sportage, created under the leadership of the Europe's Presidential Director-General, Gregory Guillaume, is even more circular.
A centimeter has come to the door and the car is breaking air even more efficiently.
The power supply is broadly unchanged, but it has been supplemented by a 1.6-litre turbine with 177 power generation.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported in close proximity to sales.
We're still waiting for it, because the new Sportage will arrive in spring 2016.
The new Kia Optim has already arrived on our land before a year's notice.

Back then, the sale of Optima Farmer will begin with its arrival.
Chisu returned to the stage and blew up bravely in your hair.
Singer Chisu is part of the Life for Children concert with other domestic stars.
There is a visible, open neck-hole in an electronic pantry.
You will find a lovely presence of a singer's star in the bonnet of a chipper.
A whole crown of gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During the three-year break, a singer who has been born has lost his pregnancy kilograms with light exercise and yoga.
The daughter of Chisu is about to complete the year.
The singer published his first single from a new CD in August.
I don't really care about standing up on the stage and standing in front of the public after a long break.
I've been sorry about everything that's been done with music, but the singer tells me.
Chisu will be publishing in a couple of weeks a new and same fourth album named Polaris.
The new life situation has inspired the making of new pieces.
At this point, you're wondering if people will find my new record, Chisu thinking.
Kim Kardashian's mother-style surprises me again - now she's on the chest.
True-to-tv beauty Kim Kardashian gives the floor to one another.
She presents her pregnancy belly and her breast supply with her sexy clothes, last night at 1:00 a.m., while leaving her sister Kourtney Kardashian's husband Kanye West's gig.
The mammary dress is open to the breasts.
It exposes the color bra under the dress in the light of lightning lights.
Last time Kardashian was dressed in an Amazonic maternity suit, when he visited his friend at a wedding party in New York only a few days ago.
The cause was highlighted by the black overcrowded boots.
The second special maternity dress is as fresh as last week's date, when the prematures included a pregnant baby.
The hard laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible.
The top manon Leloup wanted a quick idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne parties.
He made his own documentary Spating Dolls (Speaking dolls) where Leloup and his colleagues speak of pure business.
The Harper's Bazaar newspaper collected the top of Leloup's hard-to-be-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-
Each season begins with nothing.
In the last period, you would have been in the top designer's costumes, the new season will start again with skatings.
And every season, there will be a new, fresh face that will compete for work with the Conkarians.
The models rarely have a place to call home.
It is a continuous job to stay and can take a year to stay in a room or an apartment where fashion houses can accommodate their model.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be amazingly difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable jobs, but they are the most stressful jobs of all.
There is not just one type of thinness.
Agent New York may ask you to drop pounds, but then in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion patterns, models and designers are all the time together and act as the same support network.
When fashion weeks are over, the difference is lame.
The models want to be in this sector because of its potential, but do not hesitate that everyone thinks that work is just a presentation of clothes.
Models also want to be their own person.
Work makes them feel like they're actors with a role to play.
But you can also express yourself in the work of the model.
Models for Tory Burch yesterday.
In New York, fashion weeks are currently being spent, where designers will reveal their model next year.
Rope Salminen, who has changed his style, is making the most unknown assistant musician in the movie.
Roope Salminen will present Antti Latala, the founding member of the band, in a film based on the early years of the Apulanta Group.
The table was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase in Apulanta, but resigned from the band in 1994.
After all, this is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm a 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie, I'm presenting 16-year-old guitarist Salminen.
I've never been able to see the real Ant before the description, because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Anti is clearly beyond the familiarity of that crowd, so I think it's good that I'm just learning to play his music from a video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a person.
A man with a bullet in the Roope Salminen and Dogs band is not going to come.
The punk-maniers will come according to the man's nature.
During the punk period of the Stars program, surely many saw the first taste, even if he's ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but always at the full level.
In the field of assistance between 1993 and 2004 the main actors of the beautiful film you made, led by Tuukka Temose, who played bass at the bass stage, were announced today.
The nuclear forces that have become known to the band’s audience are yet relatively unknown to the general public by young actors.
Rumbal Sipe Santa is presented by Tepo Manner, singer Toni Wirsta Tatu Sinisalo bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen tipped off his coming nest last night when he mysteriously prepared himself for the most important day of his career in Snapchat.
Roope has already published in Instagram a picture of his new category, which he has had to carry out for the film.
Roope, previously seen in mustaches and jaws, has shaved his face into a siloposc and colored brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell children about refugees.
Many parents have recently had to wonder how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling me at all?
There is no need to discuss this issue, Member of the SPR Crisis Group, psychologist Ferdinand Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be protected and, for example, should not be allowed to watch the news alone.
Small children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay out of their minds and worry, she says.
However, if the child has come across a television in the news about refugees or has heard otherwise, it should be discussed.
It is good to discuss the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks for.
The children's fears may be surprising.
They may not be the ones your father thinks he's afraid of.
You shouldn't be afraid of him, even if he's anxious and afraid of himself.
The younger child is closely following the behavior of their parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child too will feel safe.
Major children are likely to come into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to discuss the matter with them if the matter concerns the child.
The fact is that all people in the world are not well at all.
Parents, together with children, can think about how we are dealing with this in our family.
After all, do we think that the world is a safe or a safe place?
Parents may also have different educational aspects - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
Second, if people talk about difficult things in the family, the child gets a picture of how to deal with problems in life.
This can be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker".
Your own powers at the end?
Still, you can be a good parent to your child.
The pallsalamaa that is hitting the vervain is difficult to control.
Perttu Pohjola was hit in the middle of the blow by Apila Ballosalama.
It only made profits and second-rates, until the end of July, in the raves, there was a collapse.
Since the slave left behind, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered his safety for a period of time from his veterinarian.
The explanation of the passing out was found in the observation.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease was not from a mild end, but from the point of view of the disease, it required two courses of medicine to take it down.
Since Apila Ballsalama is going to be in light exercise, Ostrola says that it is welcome to surprise the horse’s last run.
It was in Turku at its record time another SE-tama after the Taruntuse.
The Apila Ballmill was very upset during the break, when it was normally able to drive for only a few weeks.
It was understandable to note that the slight bending to the end was the same, as Osola says.
The coach assumes that a fair competition will make a teaspoon for the Ori.
The sound of the horse went forward from there to there in the future, and I hope that it will also be balanced.
Apilan Ballsalama has been so-called humor horses.
When you don't like it, it could've been thrown fat without the disease.
On the other hand, the secret message that the opponents have been wondering has been removed from the good days has been removed.
In the short run, the competitions won't be good for Pallosalama, which even gets rid of by warm-blooded foreigns.
Pohjola’s hopes include a power run in Vermo.
However, there is a difference between how Apilan Ballsalam agrees.
It's pretty difficult to get started, and it may be able to sneeze under the boom of the van and that kind of thing.
I hope the slave would be better than Turku's departure by now.
Apilan Ballsalama is also able to come out of the head while in condition, and we're going to drive it to victory, coach's permission.
This is why you can't get rid of the empty iPhone software.
President and CEO of Apple, Tim Cook.
At least part of the programmes that come with Apple iPhone phones may sometimes be deleted in the future - but not all of them.
Apple will be able to remove some of its own programmes from the iPhone phones in the future, says Tim Cook, CEO of the company, in an interview with Buzzfeed magazine.
Apple's iPhone contains a number of programs that are relatively rare to use: FaceTime calls, Lehkioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tips come to mind.
The most recent addition to these programmes is Apple Watch, who was forced to access iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple Smartphone owners.
According to the Cook, the removal of Apple's programmes is more complicated than it seems.
Some applications have been linked to something else in the iPhone.
If they are deleted, it could cause problems in some other phone, Cook will inform Buzzfeed about the problem.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work closely together with other programs.
There are other programs that do not work like this.
Keep going, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook your addition.
According to Cook, Apple is therefore investigating the matter, as the company does not want to waste any memory on the user's iPhone phones.
The euro area inflation declined by 0.1% in August to 0.1% in August.
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent year-on-year, the EU statistical authority Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices was led down by lower energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised a few weeks back to 0.2% of the estimate is slightly downwards.
In this year, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called underlying inflation fell by 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's estimate for the base inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent lower than one year ago in the last month.
In the EU-28, the average inflation rate in the EU-wide was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1 per cent.
Of the euro countries most, or 1.4 per cent, consumer prices rose in August in Hungary.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest in prices by 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent lower than or equal to the EU's harmonised price index.
The inflation in the euro area remains a long way from the target of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is well-known for 2% price increases in the medium term.
For this year, the ECB forecasts an average inflation of 0.1% for the euro area.
Next year, the increase will increase to 1.1%, with the central bank forecasting in its new forecasts for inflation at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is now trying to tighten up monetary policy.
The next United States recession will start at least after a year, but more likely after three years after the national central bank Fed starts to raise interest rates again for a long time.
And in turn, the bottom of the financial markets begins before the next recession.
Fed has suggested to start buying-in of interest, possibly already this week and by the end of the year at the latest.
Consequently, the next recession may be put at the earliest rate by next autumn and as a forward exchange rate on the financial markets.
Or at least this will happen if the world's largest economy and the financial markets act as they have been, and if they respond to Fed's monetary tension as they have done before.
The following conclusions have come to the conclusion of the extensive investigation of the long-term market and economic cycles of the German company Deutsche Bank in London’s market surveillance strategies Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The bank distributed over 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study Report to its international customers last week.
The strategies that have drawn up the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed is going to raise interest rates or what happens to the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, they use the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics to determine how the economy and the market have previously existed during and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical considerations, they will look at what the main variables in the economy and the financial market are now in the same or different manner as those at previous interest rates - and what could be the result of this.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a more complex way to withstand the rise in interest rates than they were in the 1950s before.
At the beginning of the recession, there may not be a year in which to begin with.
Throughout the past summer and early autumn, the leaders of Fed’s monetary policy and its current stance have suggested that the time will begin to raise interest rates.
The first interest rate raise over nine years can take place already this week.
This will be resolved within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide its two-day meeting on the matter.
For the first time, Fed raised its so-called Fed funds steering interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, the relatively regular but at a time of two years ended the number of small, 0.25 percentage points interest rates at which Fed raised its interest rate from 1.25 % to 5.25 %.
The financial crisis began in 2007 with the difficulties of the most risky housing financing in the United States, and one year later the financial crisis began to be a global nightmare on the day of judgment.
The major recession occurred in 2009.
The last time the severe reverses between the financial markets and the real economy began to start at a slower rate than the previous Fed's interest rates have typically been the case.
Correspondingly, the sufferings were, after all, harder and rougher than ever since the 1930s recession.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the growth and fall of the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950 and especially since the beginning of the 1800s.
Since the 1950s they have studied the interest rates and their economic and social impact.
At the latest, less than a year has passed since the first raise, most often less than three years and less than three and a half years.
The rise in the current exchange rate has ended within two years from the start of Fedi's interest rates.
Fed has in turn raised and, in turn, calculated his interest rate by a dozen cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has been different in some respects, and the coefficient is relatively limited in the assessment, so it is unlikely that there will be any certainty as to the performance of the subsequent interest payments.
The policies therefore remind us that this time many things are different.
And not better.
interest rates too low too long
In the light of the crucial reasons for the financial crisis, it may not be necessary to find out in doubt who did this in the course of research for even decades.
However, there are three reasons why the crisis led by the crisis and the causes that gave rise to its power of destruction must be somewhat undisputed:
1) Fed, the euro area ECB and other major central banks in the world considered their interest rates too low in the 21st century.
They found traces of a technokupla, and they grew up with the following.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already excessive amounts of debt in the financial and real economy are increasing even more than the impact of the excessive monetary policy of the central banks.
The largest volume of the economic history of the month was born.
3) In particular, the craziest-bodied debt financing packaged in most areas of the financial market, particularly in the financial history of that year, gave rise to the highest interest rates on shares in real estate, securities and commodities.
There is no doubt that, in view of the ever more complex debt caps, the high-rise financial markets were in a very dangerous and unstable position when Fed and other central banks were last upwards in terms of interest rates.
Valuation curves, which were assigned to debt securities, did not last as long as they were after the interest payments had started and the cost of debt financing had declined.
Investments took place as a financial crisis and followed by a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt.
Deutsche's strategies will not guess what happens next, but they will indicate the cause of the nuclear activity by, for example, identifying the following factors:
1) Fed and other major central banks have now held the momentum of their monetary policy even further than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis, they have now been even lower than they are before.
(2) Debt has not been insane for a long time, as it was ten years ago, but now, at its lowest, it is literally cheaper than it is to express.
Thus, the debt of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in various parts of the economy, the debt has become much more severe than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity that has been issued from one of the newest and least-favoured central banks has remained largely on the market and has slowed down the main types of securities and assets, whether at the top of the crisis or not.
Not only are the strategies for the Latin atmosphere with the marks on the financial markets, but they also point out that even the United States economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in the decades to come.
The euro area economy has barely recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak situation, but the pressures and risks of the financial market are equally higher than before the financial crisis, as Fed is next going to tighten up his cash flow.
The future picture of Albert Edwards's strategy for the French company Societe General is not as strange as it may possibly be.
For a long time he has been training international investors in Fed's following translations:
First Fed will raise interest rates, then the rectangles will burst, and it is time for Fed to go ahead and turn off the financial points at even greater QE quarters.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs for computers and printers.
The vast majority of the reductions are due to HP’s commercial service side, the company reports.
HP will be divided in November into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., which will focus on sales and consumer-oriented pc machines and outputs.
HP’s staff was the largest in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company records one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) of the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces between 25000 and 30000 employees.
Half-side reductions will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its operations to low-cost prices so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has balanced its business so that no more than 10% of its operating income is held by any of its customers.
In the second year, its three main customers brought 65 per cent of the operating income.
iOS 9 how to get a new operating system after the iPhone Apple update release.
A new operating system may be requested by entering the Regulations application, by clicking "Generals" and then by selecting "Program update".
If the update is ready, the phone will allow you to download the option and then install it.
Some people have had problems with this installation after the "The Software Update failed" error report has appeared on the screen.
In order to avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the passing of the worst traffic or try to update via iTunes.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include the removal of applications for status, but Apple has reduced this option by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process by a new tool that proposes to delete applications and then re-assess them when preparing the update.
You should ensure that the phone is loaded or in close proximity to the charger during the update that the battery does not stop in the middle.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery stops in the middle, it can cause an update to fail.

Yle: Minister Berner has worked for the government of the tax-trade company.
According to Yle, the Minister of Transport and Communications Anne Berner has been a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
Yle says that the company's activities were linked to the so-called tax scheme.
It is a Luxembourg-based Saltri II LuxCo company appointed by Berner as a member of the Board in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg Commercial Register, Berner is still a member of the Board of Directors.
Mr. Berner himself says that he has resigned from the notice of resignation in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a notice of resignation.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the feed chain takes place on an agreed date, Berner says in Yle’s interview.
A union after the merger, after the merger.
Through the Luxembourg company, the ownership of the Swedish Kährs company is managed.
Kährs is a carpentry manufacturer that was merged with the Finnish carpentry manufacturer, Karlé-Upforori, in 2012.
Berner was in the government of the Karélia-Upflor between 2010-2013 and after the merger in the Kährs Government and the Luxembourg company.
According to the above, the ownership of Kährs passes through a multi-port ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a member of the Board of Directors at the Luxembourg company Kährs at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I have been involved in the Government of Karlia-Upoflor, which is owned by Hartwall Capital.
A partnership was sought for the company that was found in Sweden.
This company is a self-owned equity investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that it was my job to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s assets.
It is important that we ensure that the income of our Finnish companies' capital is taxed in Finland and that its starting point is secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that the ownership of Hartwall Capital in the company does not involve tax management.
According to Berner, the complex ownership of the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, Triton, already had a holding company in Luxembourg ready for ownership.
In Espoo, a company-run reception centre will be opened.
The first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers will be opened in the Espoo area.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 people from this afternoon.
The number of places can increase by a week to a maximum of 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service will set up a reception centre at the premises of the former Finnish Rescue Department.
Luuna Oy, which operates in particular in the field of the provision of health care and care services, is operated by the company.
The City of Espoo, the Asylum Agency and Luna Oy agree together on the security arrangements of the Centre, among others.
RTTK prepares for an alternative work-life tightening package.
STATK will prepare an alternative package for the government's work-life blackmail.
The organisation also hopes for other employees' associations as well.
According to President Antti Palola, the current point is in the spirit of Friday.
Options for reducing the price of work will then come back to you afterwards.
Everyone understands that life will last after this date, Palola pointed out the organisation's administrative meeting to journalists on a break.
Palola considers that, on the other hand, the Central Industrial Union (EK) is not prepared for discussions.
The economic operators of the RTD have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's package of package of packages of equipment costs the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a lot of enthusiasm on the part of the party to have a conversation if you're getting half of a relationship with 100.
Palola: The conference was constructive.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) has called for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to issue a communication on its own package to the Parliament and start preparing for the reforms.
The fire did not take a stand on whether the timing is realistic.
The discussion with the government, according to Palola, exists and has been constructive all along.
In particular, the operation of Sundays in the field of STK, according to Palola, is a sick spot.
The organisation requires that the government appeals for an authoritative law to implement part of the blackmail.
In the RTDC, it does not heat up according to Palola to prepare an alternative package with the concerned SDP.
Employees will meet on Friday in Helsinki to oppose last week's government's work-life tightening package presented by the government.
As part of the package, the salary of the first sick days is cut, the overtime allowances are halved, the daily allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced to a lower rate.
The STC stresses that the central organisations have invited employees to the statement of protest and that the purpose has not been to organise a strike.
Akavan Fjäder thanks you.
President Sture Fjäder congratulates the RTD's announcement on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to the Fjäder, RTD is now coming on the same lines with Akava, as Akava already has a longer outline of alternative models for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK, the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
President-in-Office Sture Fjäder hopes that the SAK, led by Lauri Lyly, will come to prepare the proposal as an option for cuts.
Mr Antti Palola's RTDK told us earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
Protects the security of change and the working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan informed us that it has long been preparing its own proposal, which is ready to negotiate a five-percent competitive jump for cutbacks as an alternative to the government of the country.
The plan has been ready for discussion all along, and we have long been working on an alternative model for a government presentation.
We are ready to review the conditions of employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want protection of change and working time banks," says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that SAK will also come to Akava's affairs, as the RTD has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model that goes to the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The scheduled Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on any content of the agreement.
"The same boat, the common coal, the twigs" - plays bingo when Sipilä talks.
The Green Left of the University of Tampere University.
Viva bingok exonki from the Green Left of the University of Tampere for dinner.
In the past, the Prime Ministers have given a number of excuses during Mäntälä's rebellion and war.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks, exceptionally, of the nation's economy in the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 21.05 p.m.
When applying for the previous Prime Minister's speech, we have to go to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud had to make a famous telephone call that marks the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
The President and ministers then gave a number of telephone calls during the winter and further wars.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a new speech, instead of President Mauno Kovišto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976 President Urho Kekkonen gave up the strike of train drivers by telephone on the telephone.
Chatter, multi-disciplinary meinkit.
The talk of a pig has been giving all day criticisms and guesses about what I'm supposed to be doing.
President of the United Left, Paavo Arhinmäki, stated that "Sipil could give his speech on the state of the nation in the Parliament as the Prime Minister's announcement, which would also be the subject of discussion."
According to the Green Ville Phone, "the phone call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the Erkki Kõja of the SDP condemned that "the monarchist meinches: the Prime Minister will tell the people what is best for them."
Antti Rinne, President of the SD, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "It's almost six months before the elections.
There is no single presence from the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's been tried.
What are you afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's Office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and will take about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, it was submitted directly by the Chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, and Jüri Hähämies, EC CEO.
The review has been reviewed for the presentation of the Online speech.
We considered the matter and noted that it was a public service mission to promote the whole of Finland's public publicity, the Ismo Silvo Yle, Director of the Yle publications, in the news.
Just like Me at the time of the Tammels.
The speech has also given rise to cowardice.
In the evening, dinner will be enjoyed in good time, the children will be combed and dressed as best they can.
Mommy's gonna put on a nicer bitch and Dad's gonna tie his neck.
At 9 a.m., we'll be quieted down to television as we used to be in the Tammello Times," says blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government sits in tax havens with millionaires hiding their capital in their capitals, who draw up laws of mercy for other tax agents and, at the same time, claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
What Sipilä says, one guess is the Green Left of the University of Tampere Viva.
It has been published in Facebook on the following bingo.
Do we ever hear of the same boat, common coal, life and team members?
The coupons and pens are ready, at 11:05 p.m., it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Achtaria Guard: The Western countries rejected Russia's proposal for the exclusion of al-Assad.
Over three years ago, the developing countries rejected Russia's offer by which the President of Syria, President Bashar al-Assad, would have given up power, reports President Martti Ahtisaari to the Guardian.
According to the Artarsaarsaarsaarsaarsaarsaarsaarsaarsa, the Russian UN Ambassador proposed a plan with which the al-Assad would have gone out of power elegantly after a while.
However, the third countries did not take up the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall elsewhere in a few weeks.
Aristaria discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to Artarsaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurkin listed to him in a two-way discussion the three-point plans: the opposition was not allowed to arm itself, the call between the opposition and al-Assad was immediately required, and the surrender of al-Assad had to be done in a slow manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not agree on all matters, but we are able to discuss them in an open manner.
I told him what I did there and he said to sit down, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do, Ahtisaari recalls at the Guardian's interview.
Diplomatics do not comment.
Ahtisaari tells me that he forwarded the message of Tshurkin to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
The Czech Republic did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to Ahtisaari, there are no two words for it.
The UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's arguments, but said that the Al-Assadi troops had already committed several massacres at that time, and the main opposition groups refused all agreements in which they would have remained in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Director of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, takes the view that Ahtisaari's speeches are of some doubt because, according to his experience, Russia was not at any point ready to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has been supporting Al-Assad all the time.
The weakest thing about Ahtisaari's argument is that Tshurkin spoke with the Moscow mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speeches, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same thing from President Vladimir Putin, so that I could take it seriously.
According to more than that, he would have suspected, in any event, that it would have been Putin's rock to hold power with some al-Assad supporter.
The refugee stream into our own actions is our own responsibility.
Some 7 500 people had died in the Syrian crisis during the negotiations on the West Bank.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the current year.
Over 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster from happening.
The flow of refugees into Europe is one of our own actions.
All I can see is to take good care of these poor people.
We are now paying the bill that we caused ourselves, Ahtisaari says to the newspaper.
The asylum seeker's destination centre in turkish to Tornio.
The asylum seeker organisation centre designed by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be set up in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the nearby Tornio Co-lysis building in the centre of the city.
The Ministry of Interior has been looking for a suitable location for better management of refugee flows from the Swedish border.
On Tuesday, the words of the newspaper announced that the Board would already have decided to propose a school building as a space solution for the Ministry.
According to Vice-President Sauli Hööppinen (left), vice-president of the Tornio City Council, this is not the case.
When the entire council was not met and some of the members wanted the official decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he would specify to the STT.
There were 36 delegates from 43 in the local discussion.
13 councillors opposed the Centre.
On that basis, you could expect the decision to be positive, Höppinen says.
According to CEO Nousiainen, the city received a notification on Monday, and the matter was quickly addressed.
The joint session could accommodate about 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has checked that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a hundred meters from the border, so it would also be effective in that sense, says Nousian.
Sipilä is still hoping for an alternative from the labour market to blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium), half of the holiday funds held in the public would only be managed by part of the government’s goal of calculating the cost of work.
However, the Government would be happy to accept an alternative package with him if the social partners succeed in reaching agreement on such an agreement.
Sipilä told the reporters in the Parliament that she had not been in contact with the social partners.
He also did not know how seriously the organisations were looking for alternatives to the work-life blackmails announced by the government.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will, of course, welcome it as part of the entire package.
The half of the holidays would, in Sipilä’s view, act as a means of dealing with almost all employees, as opposed to, for example, the Sunday surgery envisaged by the government.
The organisations could agree on a holiday allowance cut, because they are registered under the law instead of under collective agreements.
With these visions, the government will report next Wednesday to Parliament on the blackmail of working life as a communication from the Government.
According to the citizen, the proposals of the organisations should be known before this happens.
The final maturity is not the same as the final maturity.
Legislative work starts then, so the train is moving and it gets harder and harder.
It's a good time now.
It won't be long in such a way if it does, Sipilä's voiced it.
The list published last year by the Board of Directors includes, among other things, the conversion of the final and the helitary into unpaid holidays without the exception of annual working hours.
In addition, the salary of the first sick days will be cut, the overtime will be halved, the monthly allowances reduced to 75% and the holidays reduced.
Reforms will be implemented as a mandatory law through trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the activities, the wage and salary associations organise a grand demonstration on a Friday, as well as several trade unions have declared illegal strikes.
The Board of the Board of Governors of Tohmajärvi approved an extension of the pharmacy’s warehouse.
The Board of Governors of Tohmajärve agreed to the extension of the stock of the Nordic Koivu Oy Hall, i.e. the factory store, to be approved by the Council of Tohmajärvi.
The criticism was influenced by the fact that the project was bigger and more expensive than the original one.
There is also a busy schedule too, too.
What was even more surprised that the order was not known a year ago when the decision was taken on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the stock by 400-450 sqm was approved for the investment programme, but the financing will be decided in the context of the interim report.
The item was still on the agenda of EUR 150 000-200 000 investments, but at the meeting, President Erkki Ikonen explained that the price would be approximately EUR 300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis of the fact that it brings work and income to the local government.
The municipality has no risk, since the company pays the investment in rent, Vesa Population (ps.) justified.
There is also a place for the Karelian language in Joensuu.
The government of the municipality eased its firm position to bring Swedish-language street name signs to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and appropriate, in the due course of time, to maintain a tradition throughout the region.
Joensuu does not constitute the capital of the cattle’s language because it has no historical basis, and its language is not a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Joensuu region has been more part of the Eastern savorian changes.
After a new decision, the city's centre will not be marked with a Danish-language street name sign.
However, the City of Joensuu is, on occasion, prepared to use the language of the herd, for example, in information boards and in the tourism market, for example, with good consideration.
The same approach the city recommends to all other actors as well.
Although Joensuu is an official one-language municipality, it is also worth noting the use of the cattle’s language now that there is a multi-ethnic culture in North Karelia as well.
Karelian language is still a region's specificity, as is the image of Joensuu as the whole of Finland's forest capital.
Both of them can be well used to benefit from the wide range of markets in the region.
The endings of the train connections will cut the vitality of the region.
The train connections will strike the region's vitality with a strong hand in hand.
Transport links have a direct impact on the business and competitiveness of the region.
And what seems to be the possibility of living and working here at all, is that the CEO of Joensuu, Kari Karjalainen, wonders.
He also points out that air transport, which has also been followed on several occasions in the report, has also been the subject of a number of reports.
It is important for the whole of the region that we do not have the opportunity to decline by governmental measures, as is the case now.
The effects of these terminations of transport connections, for example for employment, should be considered, the Karjalainen points out.
The deterioration of the linkages creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it will be to have students and employees," says Jukka Mönkkönen, Director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor access also affects the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot for research purposes.
Recruitment Director Marko Junkkarinen says that it is already difficult to market a university towards Western Finland because the transport links are weak in a cross-border manner.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside Eastern Finland.
They, on the other hand, account for about 10-20% of them in the U.S., which is partly reflected in direct rail connections.
Joensuu became one of the loud sounders for Siu’s soup.
The views of the national government on the regional Siu War project appear to be consensual, but there is one voice among me.
Mr Pentti Kessalo (sd., in the picture) of the Board of Governors presented the entire project to be abandoned at a meeting of the Government on Monday, but, on his behalf, it was unprofitable.
The Board of Directors approved the proposal for a decision by Mr Kari Karjalainen, which will be revised at the beginning of October before the meeting of the Council of the Regions, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all the other municipalities.
One trainee from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year.
Personal rail transport from Kotka to Kouvola will continue to remain in the future, albeit less often than one rail couple.
There will be a change in passenger transport between Kotka and Kouvola in March.
One train couple is excluded, but still five times a day goes from Kotka to Kouvola and vice versa.
The caps are due to the State’s savings operations.
The purchase of transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications for the next four years will decrease by EUR 12.3 million.
The quieter routes are completely closed.
VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March.
Boys climbed up the roof, one didn't get down, the guys slipped off the ground.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old who climbed from the helmet from the helmet, who would not have helped himself from the roof.
The situation took place in Tornionvu on Ketto Road at noon on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders on the roof at all.
It did not stop a bunch of boys who decided to climb up the roof of the house along the depression of the reactors next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
The result was that the others were sneaking from the ground and the passersby alarmed the emergency services to help attract the last missing person safely back to the ground.
FedEx's operating profit is suspicious, calculates the tax year 2016 outlook.
FedEx reports depressing results from the last quarter, and the shipping waste cut its annual forecast of revenue, as a result of the decline in demand for freight services and higher costs for its rural services.
The company also said that it intends to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
This time last year FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Its share fell by approximately 2.5% at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening hours of Wednesday's opening hours.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects the end of the tax year next May to end at $10,40-10,90, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts were waiting for $10.4, let's talk about FactSet.
Despite an average of 4.9% price increases that entered into force on 4 January, and despite the higher charges starting in November, the higher charges for the transport of heavy or large packages on the ground began in November.
The company said that it expects operating profit to continue to increase from the previous year, as they have cut costs, increased turnover and increased trade.
The President and President-in-Office of the Council, Fred Smith, said that the company "is going to operate firmly in the light of expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade."
The forms of pay during the holiday were announced the day after the competitor UPS reported that he was going to hire 90-95,000 extra workers as much as it did last year.
In the quarter ending on 31 August, FedEx's profit was $692 million, which is 6% more than last year.
Earnings per share came to $2,42, which is left over from the USD 2,44 average forecast. 12 analysts survey carried out by Zacks Investment Research.
Turnover went up by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In the morning, six analysts were waiting for $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been suffering in recent years from a reduction in international priority transport, which has led to the evolution of its Express-unit turnover.
However, the increase in net sales has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29 per cent, but in principle, the income of the activity was the same as for the cost of the larger packages and the own insurance.
Express unit income was better because of higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight fell by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction approximately one hour before the opening hours, FedEx's shares fell by $3,85, or 2.5 per cent to $15,15.
On Tuesday, FedEx closed 11 per cent down this year and 17 per cent below the June 11 record.
This week, the decision-makers of the U.S. Central Bank will be sitting around a large stomach table for two days at a long, expected meeting to decide whether it is time to raise the interest rate for the first time over a period of almost a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's decorative, two-storey meeting room is a mural of the United States of America.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank, Janet L. Yellen, and his colleagues, must set the economic interests of the nation above everything else.
The Congress has placed a dubious responsibility on the hands of the Central Bank: they must maximise US employment and keep prices stable.
However, after a major recession, the central bank's directors have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This very third requirement may be the decisive factor in the decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted.
Although most of the data shows a steady growth in the economy, the recent shock in the global financial markets may have already made the staff of the central bank already on guarded pre-emptive to increase instability; fear of how the federal fund rate would be increased even in the fourth quarter of a percentage point.
"Certainly, the labour market and inflation are the first and most important elements to be followed", says Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Executive Officer of Stifel Nicolaus & Co., the broker shop Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for leaving interest rates unchanged, the increased uncertainty in the world market is sufficient to wait for a valid reason yet," he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not reached an agreement, which is already causing nervousness to the economy.
According to a recent study by Bloomberg, around half of the economic experts predict that the interest rate level will increase this week.
Once again, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay raising, as the main indicator indicates that the potential for growth is only about 30%.
This implies a decline in the securities market if the central bank raises the level, unless the decision-makers are able to soften the impact by promising that the next raise will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index increased by 228,89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with a new figure of 16 599,85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will remain unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Chief Executive Officer of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now," he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, "they must work hard in their direction to support the financial market so that they do not get caught up in business."
Other experts claim that an increased level would calm the financial markets because it would remove uncertainty as to when the central bank operates.
Just a month ago, it seemed that the central bank would be raising interest rates this month by a quarter unit, so taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of the financial situation, which would verify the stability of the United States' recovery.
Yelle has observed in the spring and early summer that she expects the level to rise this year despite the fact that the Liberals are demanding further economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is the lowest figure for seven years and close to the level that the central bank considers to be the limit on full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of a rise in wages.
Although inflation is still below the central bank's annual target of 2%, the central bank's decision to access this is to have a temporary effect on the price of significantly lower prices.
"The economic situation is even greater than the level of interest, and it also needs to be made clear in the light of the tight situation on the labour market," notes Ian Shepherdson, Chief Executive Officer of Pantheon Macroeconomics, Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, world-wide financial markets were shaken last week when China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average index decreased by up to 16 per cent from its May record, when investors feared the slowdown in the Chinese economy would also bring global growth.
The markets have recovered slightly this month, and the Dow index is now close to 10% below the peak of the month of May.
To the central bank's decision-makers, market congestion is an additional factor in a complex equation, which tells us when the interest rate level should be raised.
"Without these events on the financial markets and the recent news of recent weeks on the economic weakness of the economy in China, the policymakers would tighten up the level of this meeting," says Stephen D. Oliner, a specialist at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former official of the central bank.
He now predicts that the decision-makers will wait at least a month to gain a better understanding of the impact.
"The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear, and you have little information at your disposal as regards the consequences of the Chinese events," Oliner notes.
The economic well-being of the economy is not the main concern of the central bank, so in principle it should not affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the central bank of the Federal Republic has become the world monetary sector.
In recent years, the power of the Central Bank has been overwhelming.
In 2013, the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, pointed out that the Central Bank could "reduce" the increase in the amount of money, had revolutions in the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are becoming increasingly intertwined, officials of the Central Bank are expected not only to change but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
The decision-making process of the central bank is "more art than science", says Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy of the asset management company Envestnet In.
This month, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank (Federal Reserve Bank) of the State of Virginia, Jeffrey Lacker, observed that "the central bank has previously overreacted its financial market movement, which has seemed to be distinct from the fundamentals of the economy."
The decision-making Federal Open Market Committee has called for interest to be raised, and Lacker, a voting member of the Committee, calls for decisions from 1998 to 1999 as an example.
The economic crisis in Asia caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points over the three meetings "despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth", Lacker says.
A year ago, the central bank reversed these operations by the central bank.
The central bank should give priority to economic stability only in the context of a major crisis, as Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest-setting committee of the Bank of England, says when the market collapses in 2008.
Posen says that the latest riot will not come near that level.
"No one wants to see a situation in which the increase in interest rates is feared because the market is getting worse," says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
As long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.
Do you miss the amazing Thai trade?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, in China City.
This store/storage was opened in 1997 and owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to as thai-Costcona, is a thyt auction that also sells to the private sector.
Yes, it's in Chinatown, not Thailand City.
Store/stock is a single stop shop that offers an amazing selection of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen supplies, furniture, and religious and mass decorations.
There's also a car department in the store if you need engine oil.
The trade is huge, and it takes more than an hour to catch all the corridors.
If a trade makes you hungry, you can eat at the LaX-C BBQ Express.
The canteen (good, cheap) inside the store is close to the cassettes, and there are several pickup-up options.
What is in the store: Do you need anything - anything - from this country?
LAX-C is likely to sell it.
Products have been reasonably priced, and a large proportion of products are sold in wholesale packaging.
Fresh products include Asian specialities and regional oilseeds, fruit and other products.
The steak is a large, same fish dish, and the staff behind the counter cleans and fills the fish and, if necessary, cooks it for you.
A large part of the movement has been reserved for a large section of frozen curry leaves, fur beetles and gala, whole ducks, fish, beef meat and bile, pork skin, fish bulls, local sausages, onions and more.
Shops are run by: Restaurant owners and co-workers, but also individual families and individuals.
The discs are suitable for both shopping carts and jackets.
Search: Fresh monthong duriot next to the cash register.
Where it is located: The Shop is located in the factory district of Los Angeles, near Chinatown and the bays of the city center - a few blocks from the true list of Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
However busy the store may be, the parking lot is usually easy.
A health diet for mammals is promoted by the National Organisation for Child Health in Rio Galessa.
SPRS has come up with a shocking habit of trying to make people understand the importance of good food during breast-feeding by publishing images of babies sucking breasts on which descriptions of non-healthful food have been painted.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients needed for the development of a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories.
However, the new study points out that increasing the level of calories is not the only change in diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Texas Baylor College of Medical Professor Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women in fact affects the genetic manifestation of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, a poor healthy diet was found to have a negative impact on the child’s immune system.
Seven channel Sunrise is a favorite viewer, despite Nine companies, to inform the management of the Today Show program.
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Tekkinson’s rush to Canberra to news the subsequent elements of the liberal party’s leader’s revelation failed to add Today’s viewers.
The Nine channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull was taken over by Tony Abbott.
The competing programme Sunrise, run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the week-long series of broadcasts covering the fall of , New York, Niagara and Cancun.
The distance between weights did not seem to affect Australian TV viewers, since the average viewer of Sunrise in five capital cities was 397 000 when Today's figure was 339 000.
Today’s average increased slightly compared to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (2-8 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (3/4 000).
Today has caught Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average of 388,000 and Sunrise 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
For the period until September, the average of Sunrise is 349 000 viewers, while Today has 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event of the whole morning.
This morning, the changes in the winds will blow more than they will in Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, please ask questions.
Published by ToDAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was the 800-language series with the former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
A new drama series, which brought together a very impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells about a father who has recently been widowed, who decides to move on the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have been wondering if Thomson is the most popular series for the bearer power alone without Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this real assurance.
The Seven Channel The X Factor program was a strong favourite of 1.136 with many viewers, easily winning the The Block series (838 000) and the TBL Families series (726,000).
The Seven Channel had a dual fate on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
The first half-hour (17-17.30) of the new visual programme launched by Andrew O'Keefe collected a average of 46,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers - which was a rather small victory from Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday evening, The Chase Australia’s first half-hour viewer average was 5,200,000 viewers, and on the other half-hour, the number was awesome.
The average hot Seat was 620 000.
The fall in the average of the second night of The Chase Australia viewers brings Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Million Dollar Minute programme, which failed to reduce the number of viewers of McGuire's program.

The three finals agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavans-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally exposed who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of the woman has been kept very secret from whom Sam Wood will be linked in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls really don't click on who got the last rose.
However, during our discussion with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, a day before the three of them became two, they may have unintentionally tipped off the identity of the winner.
The mouths of Sam Wood are sealed before the Thursday finals.
All three women were cast into a frenzy by telling them how Wood is a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity because of why they would like to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?", their answers may have offered a revelation of who won the heart of the boyfriend's heart.
Both Jeavans-Fellows and Markoski quickly mentioned Mackay as the best option for Wood after them.
The gap between Markay and Sam Wood has been complicated since the first day of the month.
"From the moment I walked in the house, (Sarahin) energy and Sam's energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the whole series", Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is really close to the earth, it's fun to be with him," Markoski added.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to be comfortable and relaxed together.
Yakay believes that he and Sam Wood would be a good match for a couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be "it's the right one."
"When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I'm with him with all my heart now," he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if he didn't, Mackay was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say," he said.
I keep as much of the remaining girls, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent on Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Channel.

Jarryd Hayne has many options where the NFL career begins.
Detroit and Seattle were most interested in entering the United States, and many other teams have been asking about him since his open day of training last year.
However, Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne's exchange bench for the time of the game, after how this Australian quantifiable drop in the Australian Rugbyliga's first takeoff when returning to the team on Tuesday, chapter 20-3 of Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next flight ticket and took her into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
The real character of Tomsula was also seen in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of calling his newcomers to be a scapegoat in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also supported Hayne publicly at the post-game press conference.
49ers' special editor, Cam Inman, reports that Haynea also encouraged the Special Teams' Office, Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the drop of the ball and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flight ticket that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This really wasn't the beginning that Hayne and his numerous Australian fans were hoping for man NFL-debyt.
Hayen was seen cursing on the way from the field after the crash, and later he told the Australian copper driver Hamish & Andy at 2 DayFM at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"It was just one of these things, you have to think about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his beard with his 2007 Origin debut when the feed in his own goal area led to the paints in Queensland.
Overall, it was still a wonderful experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed for his Instagram account in a public photo with fans holding the Japanese flag.
Elton John and the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, will meet for discussion on gay rights.
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovsky, was held at gunpoint on the Siberian runway.
Hodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 killed by a police officer when shooting rubber bullets against protestors in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in southern Nepal from police shot rubber bullets on a crowd that expressed their views against the country's new draft Constitution on Wednesday.
On Tuesday evening, violence took place in the Rupandeh region about 175 miles west of the capital of Kamandus.
High officials in the region Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that more than 1,000 protestors had met outside the police station, and some of them were throwing stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police were using tear gas and then fired into the air before taking refuge in rubber bullets.
Twenty cops and five civilians were injured, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets that were known to have been killed, but which are traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
The match was in the last few weeks in violent protests throughout the South of Nepal, where members of the ethnic group called Madhesi claim that the new provinces created under the proposed new constitution undermine their political influence.
There have been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own country.
Since 10 May, at least 40 people have died in violent interactions, 11 of whom have been policemen.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - this is a big step towards the new Constitution, but it is a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process since the disaster in April killed thousands of people.
This afternoon, legislators have voted on the Constitutional clauses in Kamandus, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Centre NHC says that Cape Verde's south of the Cape Verde has a 60% chance of a hurricane.
On a wide front of the low pressure, about 560 km south of the southernmost part of the Cape Verden island group, 60% chance of developing into a tropical storm over the next 48 hours, the United States Hurricane Center reported on Tuesday.
Another accurate low pressure parallel, located in the middle of the Cape Verden island group and the Small Antiques, also has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical vortex over the next two days, the weather forecast centre in Miami added.
Google to start the donation campaign with the goal of creating a $11 million goal for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at creating 11 million million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees who came to Europe to escape the war’s cracks and poor countries.
Google had an exceptional personal perspective in its publication of the donation campaign in its blog.
Instead of making the announcement, the Director, for his own personal experience, wrote a book by Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled with his family from Kabul at seven years of age.
"Our journey included numerous dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and dark," he wrote.
I was lucky.
However, as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family will be willing to help.
Donations will result in four non-profit organisations that help refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google told me that it was equivalent to every donation made worldwide on Google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, so that the overall target is $11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War is taking place, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has driven more than 4 million people from their homes this year.
They are also pushing war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Surgical surgery can help mildly obese patients with diabetes.
According to the research, the benefits of weight-loss operations for patients with mildly obese type 2 are likely to last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly overweight diabetics live longer after weight-loss than those who are treated in other ways than by surgery.
"It takes a long time to obtain the death data," says Dr. Robin Blackstone. He is a weight-loss expert who wrote a script in a new research journal published by JAMA Survey.
A variety of methods are used for reducing the size of the stomach in the section of the larynx or bariatric surgery.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the persons involved in the study have been sickly obese and their BMI has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. the ratio of body weight to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is overweight and if BMI is over 30, it is considered to be overfat.
You can count your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/D0ZqDv.
For the purposes of this new research, researchers in the Min-Sheng General Hospital Hospital in Taiwan used data collected from 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, stomach bypass surgery and stomach reduction, medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly overweight.
The study showed that the average BMI of the cut-off persons decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, BMI remained roughly the same for persons who were treated by other means than the operation.
Of the persons who had been cut, 36 per cent of the patients had a full and 28 per cent improvement in their diabetes.
For the sake of comparison, in the pharmaceutical treatment group, the overall improvement in diabetes was only 1% and partly about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and the "bad" LDL library "are generally better in the cutting group", the writers noted.
Researchers also followed the patient's haemoglobin levels A1c, which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
The haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7 %, the researchers will write it down.
Post-operative haemoglobin A1c decreased from approximately 9 % to approximately 6 %.
However, in the medical treatment group, it remained stable at around 8%.
This better "glycaemic control", which is represented by the killed haemoglobin A1c levels, however, did not reduce mortality over five years, reports Chief Researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The study group also compared average results between two types of surgery.
At the end of the fifth year, when compared with the group in the lower gastric tract, the gastric bypass had decreased more weight (18,7 and 14,2 kg), the weight index decreased more (7,4 and 5,1), the haemoglobin decreased more than the A1c levels (3.1 % and 2.1 %), and was likely to have achieved a complete diagnosis (4,9 % and 16.7 %).
University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix Blackstone says that although the study does not seem to support survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where the surgery led to longer life for the heavier people.
In the Swedish study, it was found that 29 per cent of overmeat in the carcase was less likely to die in a period of 15 years when they were compared with a group that had experimented with traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
"Research results are crucial precisely in showing that the operation is safe for the lower body weight index", and does not involve an increased risk of death or a disease," he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take the weight very seriously when the patient is between 27 and 30 BMI.
"I think we'll wait too long before we take this seriously," he says.
I believe that once a person has collected these genetic changes that permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to reverse the situation.
"Not everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibetan Buddhism has called for the end of the violence in the refugees' countries of origin.
Dalai Lama discussed the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the opening of his visit to the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford at the start of his Tuesday visit to Britain, which is dedicated to ethical research.
Dalai Lama claimed that, in the present situation, the needs of all mankind should be put above individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of the countries of Western Europe to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
"Not everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria in the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"It is wonderful to take care of a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to consider long-term solutions: how to bring true peace and real development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education and training.
The main thing is to think about how we can reduce the amount of killing in their countries.
We need to reverse power consumption.
Power use has never solved these problems", he added.
In taking the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks and argued that the violent response of the United States caused the violent events in the chain.
" 9/11-Sun, in a letter I presented my condolences to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and it created unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Over the last four years, the absorption of the hand-infectant in children has increased by four times in the last four years.
In the United States, toxic information centres around the world have reported an increase of nearly 400% in the intake of a highly alcoholic hand-infectant in children under 12 years of age after 2010, reports the Georgian poisoning information centre.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgian Poison Information Centre, cases of disinfectant in children under 12 years of age reported in the poisoning centres were reported in 3266 cases in 2010 and 16117 cases in 2014.
"The children are more interested in these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them will go to the emergency station," Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others want to impress their friends or face the challenge in social media.
There are videos in YouTube where teenagers drink disinfectant to get a low-fatting mood.
According to reports, teenagers have mixed the disinfectant with alcoholic mouth water to obtain a stronger drink.
The smell of mild disinfectants can attract younger children.
"The father doesn't think this is bad for him," Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (ideas) are those with added scent.
There are disinfectants that smell like strawberries, grapes and oranges, which are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfectant may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 % between 45 % and 95 %.
Especially in small children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol," the medical director of the University of Kansas toxicology centre, Mr. Stephen Thornton told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So if you wouldn't leave the whiskey skin lying at the table, but the hand-infectant is left in sight, and if the kids are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nahijahð is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed only four sprays of strawberries smelling as hand disinfectants at school, and was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, which is twice the limit of adult driving drunk, says first-aid doctor Chris Ritchey, who treated a girl at the Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
You know, when you talked to your same guy, he couldn't walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors followed him in a hospital of children at night apart in case of possible brain injuries, for alcohol caused him to fall down and hit his head, Ritchey told me.
"It was really scary," Nhijah's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
The situation could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez recommends that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and move the disinfectant away from children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants are linked to the deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a hand disinfectant containing toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authority assumes that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the north of New York, three fourth-classes planned to poison their "evil" teacher by spreading bacterial poison to the room, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand disinfectant and banned it from his class.
The police need to prevent the plan of a "quickly chatter" and abandon disciplinary action for the school.
Huhumylly: Celti has no conflicts.
Griffiths ignores the speeches about the conflicts in Celtic, and Deila admits that Hops is in a tight place, but he makes it turn.
Hearts is fighting against the Scottish Federation against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard against January's deployments that may interfere with the team's unity.
Dons raised the lead to Celti at point five.
The first half penalty kick of Adam Rooney led Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at Pittodri Stadium and gave the team the opportunity to increase the difference between Celtic and five points.
Griffiths makes comments about conflicts of interest to me about this matter.
There have been rumors about the internal conflicts in Celt, but Griffiths immediately passed them, claiming that he and his teammates do not have any feeling of working under a closer eye when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
I don't think we're under pressure, I think the players are waiting to meet.
The lack of a Scottish championship bores the Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle-level player and former Dutch national team player Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it does not have any competition for the championship with Rangers.
The new Ajaxi Ambassador de Boer said: "The Netherlands no longer displays the highlights of the Celt games, and why?"
Because Rangers is not involved.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm Team.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There are a lot of tensions in these team games, and even non-Scotlands want to follow those games.
Deila swears to turn the situation around.
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss swears to turn the situation around.
Dispose of Malmö and the resulting fall from the Masters' League resulted in a rapid loss of ten men to Aberdeen, now at the top of the series with a five-point difference from the top of the series.
But Delila said, "Celti's had bad periods before, and we're coming back."
Now we just want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know this is alarming and that many people are well, very angry or sad about what happens.
We are, too, but we must continue.
Indeed, we really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
It is important now to stay close together.
Warburton will be guarded for January’s player transfers.
Although the Rangers boss Mark Warburton commented just a few months ago on possible locations for transfers in January, he is on guard against the most recruiting conviction that he does not want to confuse the team's consensus.
The former boss of Brentford said: "The transfer window in January is very different from the window in summer."
In the case of players in the summer, the adjustment period will be the whole of the transitional period, which will be seen in our team this season.
The team is doing very well.
Increasing unfair players can do more harm than that.
Celtic's interest in Michu suggests a pension.
Mr. Swansea's attacker, Michu, whose name is linked to Celtic in connection with the transfer window, has suggested that he may retire after the end of his contract with Swans.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has had a vertigo and has failed to find a new presence outside Wales during the summer.
Hearts is ready to fight against the Scottish Federation because of Neilson's comments.
Hearts led to 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2 after that. The defender's red card was later translated, and this was the third red card Collum condemned for the last eight months, which was reversed.
Neilson stayed behind his message saying, "I didn't question the truth, I didn't comment on the performance."
Griffiths swear that Tynecastlea may be necessary.
The faithful Hibernian player was warned that he had chosen to sing an offensive song about the former Hearts Player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before Edinburgh derby at Tynecatle Stadium in March 2014.
"This was a derby, and it was a bit of a showdown," the attacker said, adding, "it seems safe to say that you will not go back to Tynecastle, unless you go on to hit Celtic."
The Government of Tannadice believes in the leadership of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the government of Dundee United still has faith in the leadership to reverse the situation, but admits that the deterioration of the players must stop.
"I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll get the boys back together," Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy to have a "bad victory" in Hamilton game.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Acces, but succeeded in reaching their seventh consecutive hit, raising them to the top of the table five points above the Celtic, thanks to the first half penalty shot at Adam Rowe.
McInnes says, "There is no team that could have won anything, whether it's a dome or a league that wouldn't have won games in this way."
Scottish unemployment remains the same as the United Kingdom's overall growth in the population of the United Kingdom.
EMPLOYMENT In Scotland, 164,000 persons remained in the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Great Britain increased by 10 000 persons totalling 1.8 million people.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the United Kingdom 5.5 per cent, and the figures in the National Statistical Centre (ONS) represent the figures in the United Kingdom.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland decreased by 12,000 persons over a period of three months, and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell by 74 per cent over the quarter, which is higher than the United Kingdom average of 73.5 per cent.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell commented on these latest chapters: "The long-term plan of the government is to build the foundations for a stronger economy."
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why do you want to execute a witness in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, later today I will watch a man execute.
If so, and I hope not, I will sit in the viewers' gallery in Oklahoma State Penitentiary, watching Richard Glossip execute with a dominant injection.
He has asked me to be one of four official witnesses to die.
I answered the request in January through his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
I've begun to fear this day as it approaches it.
Why did I say yes?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Of course, journalists will have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than free places, participants will be selected through horrific appreciation.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of places reserved for media to twelve.
Whoever chooses it will watch it cool.
I can't do it.
I'm gonna sit next to Richard Glosip's closest friends, and I've also made a connection with him through calls made over the months and one two- and a half-hour visit.
Likes a man.
Our neighbors often talk to us when we talk.
The prison authorities say that you cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I cannot carry a notebook and a pen to save what I see.
I just need to try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma reporter accused me of asking about my objectivity.
Here's the lesson.
I'll tell you the story of the prisoner in his own way, and you'll be able to participate.
I chose the supplier.
I found out that "it could have done better", but it still thinks that what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He won't tell me what I'm going to try, and I wouldn't do that if he did.
I've told him that he could at any time remove me from his witness list.
But he wants to have an international supplier who will write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Reporter Kim Bellware of Huffington Post is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to a series of podcasts I've made.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Gloshiti is innocent.
After the murder of Barry Van Trees, they would in any case make him guilty of helping.
But I believe there is a very strong chance that he is not guilty of murder.
I'm sure I don't think there was enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And so this is the perspective from which I look at her dying.
I cannot claim to be completely neutral.
There will be other operators who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of how it feels to watch the man I like die unnecessarily.
The man was lured out of the Canning River River River after a V.V. police chase.
The officer of Canning Vale remained dry when he lured a man away from the Canning River River River.
The attempt of a man from Perth to distract the police from his side went wrong when he found himself in a low, dark water just a meter away from a cop who tried to "attract him mildly back to the beach."
The Canning Vale Police were called on Tuesday for unauthorised entry into Beckenham.
When they found the suspect, this tried to mislead them by directing them to the Canning River River.
However, he did not get very far.
"He stood in the water, saying, "I'm not coming out, come back to me," said the other sergeant Shandell Castleine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec did not want his uniform to get wet, so he used a more secure tactics: "a good police conference.
"Some people do funny things to try to escape," said the parent Sergeant Lodine.
Ben Cosins, a champion football player, is an outstanding example.
In 2006, the Cosins abandoned their car in order to avoid a blow and tried to swim over the Swan River River River.
He failed to succeed in his business, but inspired the locals to start planning the Ben Cousins biathlon, a mosaic Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the operators tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's operators tried to hide their stability in his custody last year and threatens to stop competing immediately.
He blames the officials and the Racing Victoria section for claiming that you have a personal campaign against him. On Wednesday, the late rejection of Lady Tatai due to the treatment taken on the day of the race was the last resort.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for the competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation following the unexplicable positive cobator sample of LIDAR.
He has kept his tongue under control over spy claims for the past six months, and did not want "it to look like envy".
"I didn't mean to say anything about this, and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes it hurts so much that everything goes down every once in a while," Moody said.
They knew the situation was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm going home tonight, and I'm going to sleep fine.
I want to go head-to-head, and I want the owners to think I'm doing my best for them.
When they start thinking differently, I don't want to go on as coach anymore.
Then I would have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
More recently, Moody dropped a bomb in an interview with the racing.com website, where he told me that the Department of Illustration had been trying to spy on his stables.
"A year and a half ago Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in the room with a man - I name him at the request - and offered him a job in my custody if he cares about information about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should, of course, tell their lies, for they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodio, President of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, President of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this and are aware of it today.
Should I be thinking that this is going to be personal?
Has Flash Racing ever decided to man up and perhaps pass on responsibility to other than coachers for what is happening in the field?
Am I being harmful to the sector?
I'm that bad for the industry?
Well, maybe people think so.
Maybe they have to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying right now might make them think that's exactly what they're thinking.
But I'm at that point now that I don't care anymore, and it hurts me.
It really makes me sad.
I will press them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have the support of my family, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's vanity has increased with the long-term cobbolt survey of Lidar, and the late rejection led him to realize that he could "switch his license over the table.
Moody, who is best known for coaching the undefeated master Black Caviar, has called on the rule of day-to-day care measures to be "scared" after the mud or clay rot has been put on horse legs, which is irregular.
"It is against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my employees put it in the leg in a mistake.
Could have been a search for last night.
It could have been the truth, just like it was.
That was the day of the race.
Moody may face a three-month competition ban on the grounds of day-to-day search, from which the operators started the study.
It's a joke.
People who draw up these rules know nothing about horse.
"All of us understand that rules are necessary, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
In Cobram, the responsible driver of the transport flight has been arrested.
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic escape after encountering a dealer at Cobram this weekend.
The cyclists were transported to the Royal University Hospital by plane after he was seriously injured when the car hit him on Murray Valley's highway on Saturday morning morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured trader.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathala reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of failing to act in an accident, for failure to provide assistance and for other traffic offences.
A cyclist, 40-year-old man from Cojalm, is still in the hospital, and his condition is stable.
Craig Bellamy, coach of the Storm team, attacks the competitors against the rebel protests.
▪ Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the claims made by two NRL-rugbyliga masters that his team's tacs are part of the "instruction".
Mr. Roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that the divorceists allowed Storm's "press" on his side when suddenly it won the finals in Sydney on Friday night.
Mr. Brisbane Broncos, director of the Brisbane Broncos, was barely infrequent with his reference to Storm after he won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night at the finals. Bennett called the game Rugbyliga's "stamp" and said that two of the Queensland teams were not "hard-leaked" in the press.
Bellamy defended his team's tats and said that they were just focusing on "to contact" tatting.
Bellam added that her trust was increased by two leading coaching critics against Storm, because that means that they are afraid to lose to the team.
"This always comes up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about wrestling when we lost to them 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything in our defence systems or our systems throughout the year. In the last six weeks, we have just been emphasising contact with tacs, and it has led us to succeed.
Trent has been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to missing, and this was a little shock to him.
It's funny how this will always come up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of "an exciting Rugby" recalling his mentors that Bennett's coach, St George Illawarra Dragons, won the title in 2010 by playing "madly."
It's talking about exciting Rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game with our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was", Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticized for being a boring team and said that it could not be cared less.
But now he's got a team that can play a Rugby that we find exciting, especially when he's got fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you're playing when you have that kind of game.
He brought out the side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play with him like Rugby - not who has friends on the team like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt, so that we can play like that.
I will be more confident when they say such things, because they are a little concerned about playing games against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more than the game between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two more goals, but is it exciting Rugby?
Or does it make it an exciting line of defense to break and miss the goal?
I'm the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's the one who's
If they catch us, that means that somewhere we're going to fight them.
Storm will be free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game, either from North Queensland Cowboys or from the Crossu Sharks against next Saturday night's pre-final in AAMI Park. Tickets will be sold next Tuesday morning.
For a Serb man, there are $200,000 guarantees for a drug case.
The man threatened with a possible lifelong life for 40 cocaine-kilometres of smuggled cocaine in Queensland has been released against a guarantee of 200 000 dollars.
Marko Makimovic 29-year-old is one of five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police have recovered 100 kilos of drugs to the Solay yacht, which came to South America via Vanuatu, and was shipyardd in August to Comemera.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accusers on a trip all morning, and then he met them at Coomera Road Road, where he found 40 kilos of drugs from the Tokyo Echo car.
Although Maximovicia is threatened with a possible life-long life for a cocaine holding company, her lawyer claimed that there was no evidence that Maximovic tried to keep the whole quantity in its possession and that he could have been at the cafe for completely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maximovic was trying to escape.
"He has a close connection with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently", he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal court case, Makimovic will inform the police about the place where he lived.
Maximovic’s mother and his father together had offered a guarantee of $200,000 to ensure his release.
"When I read the voluntary certificates of both persons, it is clear that setting a guarantee of $200,000 is a real economic burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
But alone it wasn't enough to stop him from coming to justice, he warned me.
The bail was granted to Maximovic on condition that he gives away his passports both in Australia and in Serbia, reports to the police every day and holds his curfew ban between evening and morning.
Stevan Hogg used his phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures.
The patient used the 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl to bed while sleeping on this phone and then logged in to an online communications service where Hogg received a number of unruly images of the children that another user sent to him.
The light woke up later, and noticed that the phone was missing and found it in Hogg's hand sleeping.
Looked up his phone and found a shocking message, and then he immediately told me about it.
On arriving, the police saw five pictures, looked at the computers on the scene and found "supertainable" online searches on search boxes used to search for immoral images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "in order to seduce the paedophiles" on the internet, before he "proved the police to scare them".
Fiscal deputise Member Eilidh Robertson told the Dundeen Sheriff's Court of Justice: "He said that this is an exemption - that he is dependent on people being scared.
He admitted that he had performed a search on a computer but said that they had only been made because he wanted to pretend that he was a cop so that he could scare pedophiles.
He was asked about discussions with an unknown person who sent him the pictures and when Hogg asked the person to send him additional images.
Hogg said he did this for bait purposes only.
He said that his drinking was getting sick and he was trying to look at a picture of rape and murders.
Robertson added: "When a girl found pictures of her story, she cried out to her mother, screamed and cried.
Mother saw the unsolicited pictures in the sky and then confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
23-year-old Hogg, who lives on Ward Road in Dundea, accused him of taking pictures of unsolicited children on 14 June of last year. He broke the guarantee on 25 January of this year and did not go to trial on 24 March of this year.
Defence Attorney Gregor Sim asked that Hoggia not be entered in the criminal record, as it can be argued that his crimes did not include "a significant sexual element".
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the decision until October so that social work has time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in other cases in progress he has been arrested before the hearing.
He was added to the criminal register before the date of the decision.
Mr Robert Mugabe gave the wrong speech to Parliament.
This year, the senior director of Africa, Mugabe, fell in the steps leading up to the speaker's height.
He was not injured, but the video of the crash spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament's openings were also covered by the arguments of the opposition legislators that they had been sent with anonymous perversion threats, which warned them not to push Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, they boomed and interrupted him in intermissions during his holding of the country address to Parliament - what speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the overseer of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their cell phones, warning them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
"The number from which the message was sent does not answer, but the title of the message is 'death', Gonese told journalists after Mugabe spoke.
The message warned the relevant parties that the immunity would expire in Parliament and that, when they step out, the voluntary immunity would not be valid.
The group supervisor said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "supervised" by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard is prepared to cut 25 000-30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and spending cuts efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from growing business facilities and services more quickly.
The projected jobs bring about $2.7 billion in costs from the fourth quarter, which was mentioned in HP's press release.
"These redeployments will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," Meg Whitma, President of HP and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division, said.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than the present-day HP, and we will have a species and deep range of services that will help companies move to a new business," Whitman said.
As a separate company, our ability to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise’s annual turnover will be over $50 billion, and it will be reported in the company’s press release “contribute to the creation of non-comparative integrated technologies”.
The company was founded in the 1930s by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from the University of Stanford, in order to manufacture electrical goods. The company was operating in a garage in Palo Alto, called "The Origin of Piilaakson", located in Palo Algo.
HP has gone through a massive restructuring process to survive the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its division is in the last field, based on the belief that strictly defined companies will perform better.
Captain Mikkel Arteta of Arsenal says that team members must support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb’s game.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now, and assuming that his rehabilitation is going to work as planned, there is no reason why he would not be back on the game by Christmas.
In this best case, at least four of the following games will be missed: and given his background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity in this recent problem is that Wilshere's last season ended with a strong end after a single stroke, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
"This injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
It's nothing weird.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or previous injuries he's had.
This may be the case from a medical point of view, but, as Wenger also admitted, the player’s attempt to re-enact through the course of the play always has an additional risk of injury.
There is also an unpleasant pattern of transformation.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd shows that Wilshe has had 23 different injuries since she debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five years, he has played Arsenal 1 57 games in only 65 games.
For Arsenal's wider audience since 2007-08, for six months of eight, it has been one of the Valioliga teams that have lost the most days due to the injury.
Wenger admits the possibility of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that their last season's improvement to the injury rate will continue.
"Sometime that you come back from the injury may be a vulnerable period, when you need to strengthen your body and gain competition," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will become more stable, I'm sure that it will happen, and that he will be able to do what he deserves to do.
Wenger prepares for recycling into his team when Arsenal starts the Champions League game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then on Saturday, Chelsea and next Wednesday, against Tottenham Hotspur.
Subject Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not gone to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arta are likely to be at the start of the project.
Wenger can also replace Kieranţ and Olivier Giroud with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep my balance and give a break to players who need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is a clear continuation of the F-block, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most frightening in Europe.
Dinamo has also not lost 41 matches since they brought their own "Unbelievable" campaign last month.
On Tuesday night, an earthquake, the strength of which was 3.2 on the Richter scale, was shaking.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned from the surrender of the Champions League last season against Monaco, and was still motivated by a distant dream leading the team to its first victory over the European Cup.
"This motivation is huge," Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not victims.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about friendship between men.
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in the series, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, and the suicide rate for young men higher than for the 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the biggest cause of death in men aged 20-45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem of Campaign Aginst Living Miserably (CALM) announced the year 2015 for men, the aim of which was to challenge a culture that prevents men from getting help when they need it.
Friendlyness is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
A recent study included over 2,000 high school and high school-age students who showed signs of depression, and according to the study, a person’s chances of recovery doubled if a sufficiently high percentage of his friends were “welcome. ”
As for those who were not depressed, the likelihood of possible mental health problems was reduced if they had healthy friends in mind.
But in order to be able to act, it must be available.
Through this social media, communication time is passing through, and the immediateness of the answer is often more important than contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to seem strong, happy and successful, even though isolation actually controls us.
This side of success is governed by the values that the psychologists call external: money, image, social status. All of this happens at the expense of internal values - internal longing for personal growth and kindness - which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game maker explained in the opposite, money really does not get any more happiness.
The fineness of the French was just that it turned this focus upside down.
No character was defined by their work, but rather by their universe, which was clearly distinguished by interaction as dreams.
Joey and Chandler's numerous hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, looking at the football, I miss Rachel - their humor came from the fact that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to examine their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer explained to me: ..."in listening to people who are depressed and self-destructive, I have really understood how even the smallest interaction with a friend can improve their situation."
We often contact the men who experience that you cannot talk to friends.
The old idea of "overcoming" is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up to problems, you will see a weakness.
Fenders are one of the series that comes to mind when I try to provide longer-term means of survival.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my objective, external position at the end of the phone helps people at a moment of despair, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And if you participate in the Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend, and all the pictures are redesigned for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a coffee?
Or better yet, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can never know how much you can think of.
The fans will be sent to Comedy Central from the start to the end, all Section 236, to attend #FriendsFest.
Maria Divia paints and helps the PSG hit Malmö side by side.
Angel Di Maria invites Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan to join forces against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored in the debut of the Champions League, helping PSG pass the Swedish team Malmö on Tuesday.
Downstairs report and reactions to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in the right direction when Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League game with a nice 2-0, win Malmö against Parc des Prince on Tuesday.
In the debut of the Masters League, Maria scored the goal for less than four minutes, pointing the way to the British League Champions, but the team lost a number of chances before finally adding their way to Cavan's hit at 61th minute.
The Paris, which is in the same A-block with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, for the game was not only a continuation but also an improvement in their quarter-finals leading fears in the last three rounds of the last three rounds.
But even though PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, for the team of Laurent Blanci Zlata Ibrahimovic lost his spot in front of the goal and later was replaced from the field. Malmö is his old hometown team and the team where he started his great career in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or in guests, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for the opponent and looks good in statistics, and it is a good start, even though there are things we have to do this season", said Blanc.
This is a good one.
We wanted to win and win, even though I doubt we did not succeed in making one or two goals more.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisi team in one of three amendments made after the team was 2-2 in Ligue 1's home game against Bordéux in the weekend, but he stayed in the shadow of Di Maria at the fourth minute.
When he moved from United last month, the Argentinian maid was named the man who takes the PSG to a new level in Europe and he proved why when he ran the Marco Verratt's pitch behind Malmö's defence line and then struck a beautiful final past Johan Wiland along the back of the net.
However, if someone expected a easy and big victory from PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a hefty opponent, who won at the Celt's decision-making when he arrived at that, its opening-up field has nine international players and five men's defense, and two players in the deep middle field.
But the team did not offer much more than the 34th minute of Nikola Djurdjic shot on the attack side of the team, which went right past the goal of Kevin Trapp.
On the other hand, the PSG was sometimes in trouble due to lost inputs and poor finalisation, in particular from Ibrahimovic, which, in total, failed in five companies only in the first half and then disappointed when Cavani put the ball in the Ibrahimovic contact immediately at the beginning of the second half of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in doing the pre-work to his colleagues, and it was from Ibrahimovic's feed that Di Maria sent out a twist kick that fell around Wiland's goalpost in 52 minutes.
The second goal was achieved at the end of the hour after the second game, thanks to the excellent Cavan of the sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had pulled forward from Maxwell's cross-food.
It ran out of Malmö's wishes to get back into the game, and only Wiland's great fight against David Luiz's direct firing kept the final numbers down before the Azequiel Lavezz goal, which came from the exchange, was abandoned at the end of the game.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later found that PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: "Our last Masters League game was in December last year."
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
The fights are not enough.
Raise the hat to Paris.
They thought this was a great game.
Glencore amounts to a total of 2,5 billion dollars per tonne of shares in sales.
The extractive industry in Switzerland, Glencore, who suffered a price collapse of basic commodities, collected USD 2.5 billion on Wednesday, selling shares as part of its extensive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, announced in the notice that it had sold new shares in exchange for approximately GBP 1.6 billion to reduce its debt.
A company that lost 57 % of its market value this year is struggling with the prices of collapsed commodities, as the slowdown in the Chinese economy is causing demand and causing destruction in all markets.
The mark increased Glencore's share value to the London Stock Exchange's top of Wednesday's Wednesday's purchase.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent, by 60 per cent in FTSE 100, which opened up by 0.69 per cent higher than that of FTSE 100.
Glencore had reported last week as part of a $2.5 billion stock trade, a wider plan to cut its 30 billion debt burden by about one third.
The company sold the new share capital with 125 pence, which meant a reduction of 2,4 % to the final price on Tuesday.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares with a total value of 9.99 per cent of the joint venture.
Concerns about the long-term slowdown in Chinese growth have cut iron ore prices by about half, while prices of carbon, copper and other commodities have decreased by 20-40 per cent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington to Washington.
The President of the Republic of China, Xi Jinping, will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House's opinion on Tuesday was confirmed.
The first official visit to Washington will take place on 25 September and is the answer to President Barack Obama's last visit to Beijing last November, said in the opinion.
The President of the United States and the spouse of the President, Michelle Obama, will organise a dinner for Xe and this fellow member of the Peng Liyuan after bilateral negotiations have been held by the President of the United States.
"The visit of President X will enable us to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a number of issues of common interest in global, regional and bilateral matters, while at the same time giving President Obama and President X the opportunity to discuss constructively the issues of disagreement", the opinion added.
The visit, which was first announced in February, is expected to take place in Seattle on the way to Washington to meet a number of U.S. CEOs before continuing towards New York and the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xin are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concern regarding the alleged online espionage in China and the increased condition of the country in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces the difference in filmmaking between filmmaking and filmmaking.
Matt Damon brought together an African-American filmmaker, Effie Brown, in their discussions on the difference that Damon said did not need behind the scenes.
An actor experienced in the Project Greenlight section on Sunday evening of HBO interrupted Brown's emphasis on the need for different perspectives as regards the dark main character of the script selected for the project.
"When we talk about diversity, it will be taken into account when selecting actors in the film, not in the series," Damon said.
The shocked Brown reacted with unbelievably, with comments "Oh! Wow. Okay", while the comments of the actor The Martian remained in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finals of the series.
"I'd like to call on people to think, whatever the director is, how they treat Harmony's personality," said the beginning.
The only dark figure is the whore that his white pimp beats.
The Dear White People producer demanded that the rights of the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio be directed to the finalists; Damon replied harshly that their guidance "could end up giving us something we don't want to."
When the debate had been debated, the social media blew up the comments of Damon.
"Matt Damon speaking to the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is such a LAUGHTER that it happens."
After publication, the Twice collected more than 5,000 rewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Damon's comments point to a time when a precise racial presentation in the media is at the heart of social debate.
After the White Police killed a teenager named Michael Brown in 2014, The Black Lives Matter spread into a nationwide world and encouraged the legislators and ordered them to stop discriminatory practices against people of colour.
In February, singer Prince referred to the release when he presented his album candidates for the Grammy Prize.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Books and black lives, albums are still important.
The presidents of the Black Lives Matter movement recently issued an opinion in response to the question of whether the group should be regarded as an angry group by the president of Fox News, Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of people," the leaders said.
It has just been said that Damon is part of it among the entertainers, producers and media players invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrier crowned the first American Ninja Warrior.
The professional athlete and collector Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday and received the one million dollar prize.
The competition programme, which has just reached the seventh period of time, has never had a competitor that would have solved all the advantages of the programme.
In the last section of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
In the last assignment, it was meant to climb a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge in time for him to become the first athlete of all time, who solved the exhausting 4th episode of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero solved the challenge three seconds faster, which made him the winner of America’s Ninja Warrior.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after the difficult victory and was still shocked to win the prize of a million dollars.
"It is wonderful to think of this when I have never earned or lived for less than $10 000 a year," Isaac told E! after a big raise.
So suddenly... I can't even imagine what this is going to be like... the future is unknown.
The President of Production, Kent Weed, spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Britten does not receive more money, even though he is the first competitor of all time who has managed to get to the track.
Under the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
"If more people pass, the money gets to the one who has the fastest time," Weed said.
Because it's a great reward and it changes life, but it gives him a great sense of retaliation.
I don't think he feels any resentment for that.
He's just so sure that he's done what he did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy and a real father.
She's his child and his wife's hero.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone had to beat me, I'm sure it was Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have thought the same way if this were the other way around.
American Ninja Warior returns to the eighth period, the description of which will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaking through the Twins in Minnesota through Minnesota. Detroit Tigers cross the Twins.
MINEPOLIS -- the second half of the season has not been much fun for Detroit Tigers.
Tigers was sometimes one of the best baseball teams, but is now the last one in the American League Central division.
Tigers perfectly played the role of the pilot on Tuesday, when he won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field field in Minnesota.
The Twins lost the chance to rise from the Houston Astros in the competition from the point of the wild card of the American League.
The game for Detroit was at least one night in return for a period of at least one week to the initial H-word, which had been very difficult to reach for most of the last half of the season.
"All profits are fun, regardless of how they are obtained," said Brad Ausmus, team leader of Tigers.
Alfred Simon, who was the leader of Tigers, continued his early attack aid when Detroit ran three times on the first shift, and then once on the sixth and again on the ninth.
Simon-13-9) baits 6 1/3 in conjunction and allowed three runs to run.
This was just his third quality start at the last nine games.
"I just want a strong stop for this year," Simon said.
It's hard for the switch to enter every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Tiger Deputy Victor Martinez hit three times and enabled two runs, which were his first hit after the middle of August.
This was Martinez's first three-legged night after he hit the Seattle Mariners four times on 6 July.
"He had a good taste," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in practice), he looked much better in practice and continued to do the same in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the third half of the last half of the seventh interlocutor, and that was their best chance of getting back into the game.
Byron Buxton, the appreciater, started by hitting each other again and then out on the left side of the field line.
Aaron Hicks, on the right side, was housed in a single nest, and Simon was able to burn directly to another nest player, Brian Dozier, before Simon was replaced with the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Maurer, the only player against him, the first-initiating surrogate Miguel Sana, who pulled a two-way run to the left from Drew Verhagen, the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
With two runners in the field and a smoothing runner in second base, VerHagen got a three-tier Trevor Plouffen hit the ground leading to a double game.
This was a headset record: for the 27th time this month, when Plouffe hit doubles.
After Detroit had received a backup run at the 9th initiative, Mauer threw two hit-and-runs against the Tiger's locket Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right player burned the Word in three shots in his fifth rescue.
At first, the Detroit took advantage of the rusty Phil Hughes.
Tigers got three runs in the first two with the right-hand veteran player, who got off the injured list before the game after more than a month of lower-back infection.
"It's obvious that I didn't want to start with you," Hughes said, "but in the run-up, I was more comfortable, and I felt like I could make some nice food on the third swing."
After Hughes caught the first row of the first strike, he gave the second nest to the player Ian Kinsler to pass one by one.
On the right side of J.D. Martinez's walk in the situation of two fires led to a round shift of Victor Martinez, who took himself to the top of the top in the middle field and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipelines with its runners in good running conditions.
The third-season player Nick Castellanos continued to hit the right and to run another run, but the dangerous situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected while trying to get to the third-seat.
Tigers continued on the other side and received one fire, two-seater kidnapper James McCann and two fires, one-seater Centrifuge Anthony Goest, followed by 3-0.
"It was an important hit," said the team leader of Twins, Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right place.
Hughes began to be a power-reader and fed the unrivalled second parallel, after which he replaced the right successor A.J. Achter.
Hughes had three runs for six hits and a walk with four fires.
NOTE: Anibal Sanchez, the right feeder of Tigers, got rid of the tossed head of the head due to a stretch.
He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who cut the top of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since mid-August due to the head start, but he had to come back on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is outside, a left-handed feeder Daniel Norris will come from the injured list to start against Twins.
Norris statistics in Tigers are 1-1 on four initiatives after the left-handed feeder David Price was replaced on 30 July.
Norris has been out since 20 August due to the right distension of the abdominal muscle.
The three-game series between Tigers and Twins ends on Wednesday in the Target Field field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA) by the right-hand driver of Minnesota.
Xi calls on Xi to open the economy to a wider global economy.
The economy should open up more to the world outside for growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday to guide the reform.
"The person should commit himself to attracting foreign funding and expertise and developing a policy of transparency", he said in his speech at the 16th meeting of the Group leading to the deepening of the reform.
Supporting transparency while driving forward reforms to increase new movement and vitality and create a new economy, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access restrictions, a loosening of the border inspection principles, a call for state-owned companies to take hold of private capital, and a revision of the resident registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created, identifying the sectors and companies to which investment cannot be made.
The testing process will be carried out on a continuous basis and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it plays a greater role in the allocation of resources on the market, ensures a legal environment for businesses and makes markets more transparent, as stated in the opinion.
The government will also loosen its control over the power it distributes to companies, thereby ensuring that companies decide for themselves how they manage their business.
The opinion also stated that China will allow border regions to explore new cross-border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms for regional growth.
In order to open up the sectors governed by the government, more sectors will be opened up to private donors.
"The government does not change its policy regarding foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of companies financed by foreign finance and provide better services for them", said the opinion.
In addition, the process of seeking permanent residence permits for foreigners, "green cards", will be facilitated by optimising requirements and reducing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the protection of the professional rights of lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and the senior presidents Liu Yunsha and Zhang Gaoli, who were informed in a post-meeting opinion.
