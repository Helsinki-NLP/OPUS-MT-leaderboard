I teach Chinese language.
It's as if it's poured on me as if it were.
I slowly realized that I misunderstood him.
He was snowing the last day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
This happened at the beginning of the last week.

I think Tom said something else.
I think that should be forgotten.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm thinking.
I'm thinking, so I'm real.

He had a very big impact on me.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical drama.
It's hard to put into practice what we were talking about.
It's nice to have fun.
You're welcome to enjoy yourself.

Some people find it hard to understand.
It is high time for you to start a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.

This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need some rest.
It's never too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It is not easy to solve the problem.
The alarm cannot be switched off.

I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
He's not that cute.
This is not the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.

Wow, it's bad today.
Oh, my God, that's so sweet.

You'll have to be ready before you have to.
It's gonna take a while for you to get used to wearing your glasses.
He'll be gone soon enough.
It will work if I replace your polarity.
As a result, it seems to be better.
She looks good.
You don't seem to need me here.
You could use a shaving.
Looks like you're not having a good time here.
Looks like you've been thinking about everything.
That makes me sad.
It does.
This could be a long time ago.
It's a trap.
This can save your life.
We'd love to have a look at you.
I might be late for that.
You have to wash it.
You have to report something.
I'm sure it was love.
He must have been swept away.
It needs to be fixed.

I've arranged it.
I went on the 58th road.
I was sure you were on our side.
Last night, I took my cat to the animal hospital.
I took my shoes off.
It's a pure-bodied pan.
It would probably be cheaper elsewhere.
The rain broke out yesterday morning.
It's the other day.
It rains a lot.
I work out two hours a day.

This is all your fault.
It's 7 o'clock now.
It is already in progress.
It's 10:00 in the morning.
One of my dreams was always living next to a stream.
It's always the same nostalgic.
An environmental disaster.
It's a dirty business, Watson, a disgusting, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a shame.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a very strange block.
It's a reputation.
Cold.

It's perfectly normal.
It's all right now.
It's dangerous.
Down here.
That's really good.
Ready.
It's easier to start than to stop.
From a distance, it's easy to be brave.
It's simple to understand why Tom doesn't like Martin.
It seemed like a eternity to me.
It looked like the bus was late.
That sounds absolutely like it.
It looks like it was just you and me going to school together.
Looks like nothing changed.
That's a good look.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Looks like Tom's not in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to happen to me.
It seems to me that you're honest with me.
You seem to be wrong.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary visit.
It's embarrassing to be late for a break.
That's exactly what you want.
This is it.
It's fair to get the same salary for the same job.
Absolutely not perfect.
It's far from the ideal.
This is for you.
You know, that's funny.
It's getting late.
It's becoming a mess.
We're going to have a hard time.
It won't be easy.
You're lucky to see a rosary star.
It's nice to be gay.
It's good to go on a tour.

High.
The kids are in bed by now.
Stop with the money. Stop with the money.
Tonight's nicer than usual.
That's illegal.
It's important.
It is important that parents stand on the same side when children are raised.
It is important that we help those who are in trouble.
This is impossible for all of us.
We need to drown here.
You can't get some air in here.
Unable to meet your requirements.
It is impossible to defend your own terms and conditions.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
I can't believe it, you know?
It's inevitable.
This is inspirational.
It's just a hunch.
Just move on from there to there.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets back in trouble.
It's just a phone.
All I'm saying is I don't want to die today.
It's pretty hard.
That's important.
You're really damn right you're taking me home.
It's nice to hear you say that.
It's late.
Today's laundry.
It's like a sea field, and the turtles, them, and sharks over it, like flying creatures.
It's closed.
It's me. It's me.
It's me, Tom.
It's me.
It's me.
It's the way it looks.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life.
This is my life.
That's my problem.

Now it's my turn.

We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There is no need to do that again.
It won't take much time.
It worked out okay.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It would be hard for me to get out of here.

I was sitting on a chair in Bern at the Patent Office when I came up with a sudden idea: if a man is released, he doesn't feel his own weight, and that upset me, and he led me to this gravitational theory.
I was sitting next to Tom.

I was standing with him.
I was at home.
Thirty minutes I was in traffic the evening.

If only you would have done that early in the morning.
You'd let Tol finish his story.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
I don't want you to do that right now.
I woke up.
I'm so tired I turned around.
I was wondering what Tom was doing.
I was wondering if others were wondering as much as I was.
I'm wondering how I could do more.
How much it could cost.
I wonder how this works.
Is the time clear tomorrow?
Was she married?
Is there an easier way to do this?
Is there a man named Tamás here?
I wonder if Tom will be here tomorrow.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
What did the painter mean by that?
