Putin: Ukrainian troops are shooting civilians.
President Vladimir Putin accused the Kiev leadership of refusing direct political discussions with the Eastern separatists on Monday.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to engage in a meaningful political debate with the central part of its country, Putin said according to the news office Itar-Tassi.
He also said that the Russian-minded separatists, who Kiev and the West claim to be assisted by the Russian army, tried to push Ukraine's troops further than they do now, in the context of where Putin said that Ukrainian army troops were shooting civilians.
The aim of the military fighters is to push away these armed forces and their artillery so that they do not get the chance to shoot the people in the area, Putin said.
The event was held on Fridays and Saturdays at the Rhyrm Correction Airport.
It surprised me that the crowd had already arrived from the beginning of the evening.

In Finland, on Tuesday, a law will enter into force which will limit the acquisition of explosives suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must apply to the Police Board for authorisation to purchase or hold substances or mixtures that could be used as a source of explosives.
The substances concerned are hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane, nitric acid, potassium carbonate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, and the mixtures containing them if the specified concentrations exceed the specified levels.
Hydrogen oxide is present, for example, in cleaning and detergents, but the concentrations do not generally exceed the limit values.
Nitromethane is used, for example, in the context of an acceleration process.
However, the materials obtained before the entry into force may be held and used until 2 March 2016.

Selection: Super Raheem cast a spell - Mario was left in the shadow - with Valioliga - Evening Sanomat.
The anti-19-year-old Raheem Sterling again showed why he is considered to be the hope for the future of the English football.
White Hart Lane had an electronic climate on Sunday, when Mario Balotella confirmed that Tottenham had arrived at the guest house.
The first appearance of Super Mario was promising: experienced English suppliers saw 24-year-old Italians working on the field with a very different attitude from that of the World War II in the Times of Hong City.
The ballet was still far from its state of the art.
The Italian lost three high-quality destinations and fed only half of the sixteen to his own team.
The poolists who have already preferred the player will expect a better game in the future.
Brendan Rodgers, a member of the team of Luis Suarez, has planted Balotelli in Barcelona as the second attacker to the team of Luis Suarez, along with Daniel Sturridge.
The star of the team was sparked by Raheem Sterling, who hit the 3-0, important opening paint over Hugo Lloris, instead of Balotelli.
Sterling, 19, not just shines with its power.
A Britishman less than 20 centimeters is between the lines of the opponent than the fish in water.
The feature is not common for a player who thanks the lawn at its best at an hour speed of about 34 km/h.
Rodgers also deserves great thanks for the progress of Sterling.
After the fight, a North American told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a North-Western Londonist that grew at the root of Wembley just a more comprehensive player.

Lidl tadoko udjaid su Finland
In the financial year ending at the end of February, the turnover of Finland’s Finnish retail trades grew by almost 25 per cent to a total of EUR 1.2 billion.
the CEO published the data on Monday.
Lidl now has a total of 142 stores in Finland, and enlargement is planned to continue.
Lidl also explained that he paid nearly EUR 14 million to Finland for the last financial year.
Lidl Finland is part of the German Lidl Group.
Finland has more than 4 200 employees in Finland.
In the less frequent cases of ovarian cancer in rarely populated areas due to delayed diagnosis and access to complicated treatment, there is an increased frequency of ovarian cancer.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have published the video in honor of the one who died of the ovary in 2007.
In Australia, women living in rural areas are at a higher risk of developing ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
In 2005, researchers went through more than 1100 Australian women with ovarian cancer diagnosis and found that only 35 per cent of women, or more than five years after diagnosis, were diagnosed.
Chief Researcher Susan QIMR from Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in sparsely populated and remote areas were most likely to die by 20% in the course of the investigation than women living in urban areas.
INFORMATION: New medicines may slow down lung and ovarian cancer.
Researchers went through women's health history for seven years.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of a woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected the possibility of survival.
In older women and in the longer term, the probability of survival at the time of diagnosis was low.
In the rarely populated and remote areas, 20 per cent of women were likely to die during the survey compared to women living in urban areas.
The study did not seek to find out why women living outside the city are less likely to survive ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers that there are possible causes of delayed diagnosis and complicated access to care.
"Gynaecological oncology professionals treat this disease best, and their receptions are mostly located in large cities," says Jordan.
Although distance care is becoming more widespread and the importance of distance is diminishing, the researcher also proposes to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialist physicians can treat patients closer to their home, as well as programmes to support patients taking care of their home.
According to Dr. Jordan's research, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and better anti-cancer programmes.
A survey funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer Association will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neavella, a family mother living in Gold Coast, 33 years of age, found malignant ovarian cancer.
The City of Rovaniemi wishes to strengthen its activities in the park of friends, which is located next to the hotel in Ostrobothnia.
On Monday, the Board of Directors decided that the proposal for a positioning plan for the Friend Park and its surrounding environment would be set at a public service point in Osvita.
The draft formula is requested for opinions from the Environment Committee and the Lapland Ely Centre.
With the help of the change in position, the city wishes to enable tourism-related commercial activities in the region to function in the area of road transport.
The site is intended to establish a park area which includes an area between the current Friend Park and the river.
According to the exhibition, between 15 November and 30 April no more than 200 commercial brands will be permanently available on site.
You can also place fuel points in a specific part of the area.
A new park area is also allowed for transport.
The town of Rovaniemi has leased the area of the Friend's Park to safari companies for the use of car parks in winter time.
The rental agreement was last renewed in spring 2014 and will be valid in spring 2018.
The car park activity and design change have been a source of even loud opposition.
The inhabitants of neighbouring regions have been at a loss both to vote and to be concerned about emissions.
However, the emissions of the region have been examined and no observations have been drawn up in relation to the targets.
Even a reformed vehicle is less efficient than the old one.
The friendly park as a parking area also supports the fact that if the place of departure were to be moved further away, safari customers of the hotel would have to transport to Safari departures by buses with an estimated 15 departures per day.
The area and the surroundings of the park are also as wide as the places that have been presented for replacement starting points, such as the eastern side of the bridges of the Ounasjoki River.
The friendly park is good for its location, so that activities can be extended in the future, for example, to the Ounaspaviljong region.
The consolidation of the parking activities is part of the urban strategy adopted by the City Council of Rovaniemi, which states that the city aims, inter alia, to create a good framework for business activities by providing sufficient quality areas for logistical and functionally affordable places.
The Friend's Park is also marked as the starting point for snowmobiles in the Centre's partial general scheme, which has not yet been given the authority.
The fall in ownership is visible in the garden trades.
The decrease in the number of owners, especially in groups under 35 years of age, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions when today's young consumers reach the "main target group" for their age. The Financial Times reported on a study by the British Úttural Trade Association (HTA).
According to the Financial Times Report, the housing tenants use only 55 per cent of the money used by the owners for gardening.
The survey also showed that more and more people live in very urbanly populated housings without gardens, and that the entire garden is smaller when the front yard is more and more covered as a parking lot. These factors also threaten the garden sector with an estimated value of approximately GBP 5 billion per year.
In London, housing ownership has fallen from 61% to 43% in six years, where garden products use the least money per household in the whole country.
However, according to HTA and the United Kingdom Association (RHS), the increase in renting of dwellings or the reduction in garden size does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the leader of RHS, says that "for example, plants grown in transferable holdings are particularly popular among renters for housing, as such farms may be included in the change if necessary".
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were the booming season of the resold in the horticultural sector, as the ownership and wealth of housing increased from the late 80s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that this year's increase in trade will be seen as a result of better weather conditions, worse than last year's March and April weather.
Turkey is questioning an American diplomat for a spy report.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited the country's most experienced U.S. diplomats to report on the report on the U.S. and British spying in the Turks.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Bulent, the US Ambassador and the Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and The Intercept have written that the documents provided by the former National Security Agency (NSA) by Edward Snowden reveal that the former National Security Agency (NSA) of the United States of America and the United Kingdom is the main spying target for intelligence services in the United States and the United Kingdom.
According to the press offices, President Recep Tayyip Erdoga of Turkey, the meaning of the report was that all the major countries have stabilised each other.
A previous report on the belief in Ankara of the main intelligence service in Germany led to a more angry reaction in the World War I.

Mallorcan Magalufi Police Chief of Police accused of corruption.
The case was found to be evidence of a blackmail by police and Calvià's government officials at the Public Prosecutor's Office in Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police of Calvià on the Mallorca Holiday Island is arrested for corruption charges brought by the shopkeepers and barristers in the Magaluf region known for their humid celebration.
Captain José Antonio Navarro was put in custody after several of the business owners of the Punta Ballena Street filed charges of corruption against him. In Punta Ballena street, the majority of Magaluf bars and nightclubs are located in the majority of Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to Mallorca Diario, a magazine published online, evidence of a blackmail by police and Calvià's government officials at the Office of the Public Prosecutor's Office for Anti-Corruption in Mallorca was found on the page.
The National Guard has arrested two other local police officers in connection with corruption charges, and they are the judge's interrogation with Navarro.
ABC, a countrywide newspaper, wrote about the party of the angry authorities of night club owners, which significantly troubled their business.
"It is no longer about money, it is about survival," one of the owners noted to the court.
You're not ruining our business.
We have nothing to lose.
In several countries, Magalf was in the headlines of the magazines this summer when a YouTube video was released, where an 18-year-old British holidayer had oral sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crackl.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to attack the intoxicated and uncontrollable use of Magaluf's holidayers by reducing the number of participants of the infamous, alcoholic pub cracklie.
In addition, the Play Night Club, where the oral video was filmed, was set for a year to be closed, and the fines of EUR 55,000 were imposed on the owner of the night club and on the director of the pub crackl.
In particular, the popular tourist destination of Magaluf among young British tourists has also become popular with the so-called "balconing" trend, which has caused several alcohol-related accidents when people have jumped from balcony to balcony or balcony to hotel pool.
The children of Israel will return to school after the war in Gaza after the war.
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shields when rockets and mortars bombed their communities in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed as the region recovers from battles.
The opening of schools created joy and excitement in rocket bombarded communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the struggle are still visible.
In the Pashosh Day Home in the city of Ashdod, located in the north, workers removed the traces of the fragments from the walls and slided before the children arrived, after the rocket hit the day-care home.
"We are a little scared, but also excited," says Ronit Bart, who lives in Kibbuts, the Kibbuts of Israel, and works as an English teacher in the city school.
Many children living in this area are severely in need of routines.
In the opinion of Bart's 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, back to school in a long time, feels "a little strange".
"We've had difficult times sometimes when we didn't go home to anywhere," he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited close to the Gaza border with support provided by Kibbuts.
At the beginning of last week's ceasefire, thousands of people in the border area of Saati had stayed indoors or left their homes for safer areas in Gaza to escape the fire of rockets and grenades.
Many of the residents of the Nahal Oz Community in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip are suspicious of the return after the death of a four-year-old son of a Palestinian grenade in the Community.
According to the Ministry of Education, a fair ten families had not yet returned to their home.
The children of these families are now placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited school in Sderot, near the border of Gaza, a city that was under heavy Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to study hard and promised to "care for children's education and safety".
Israel and Hamas will agree on the current ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately interrupted the battles, but it did not resolve many key issues, such as Hamas's call for the removal of Israel and Egypt and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaways.
Israel wants to take off Hamas's weapons and restore the body of two Israeli soldiers who died in war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
According to Palestinian and UN estimates, more than 2 100 Palestinians died in the war, of which three-quarters were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel has disagreed with the number of dead, according to which at least half of the dead were insane, although it has not had any good reason for this.
Half of Israel died of 66 soldiers and six civilians, including, among others, a Thai worker.
In battles, Hamas and other Gazani soldiers shot 4 591 rockets and grenades in the Israeli cities mostly in the south.
For the Israeli army, more than 5,000 attacks and other attacks were carried out on behalf of the army.
The Israelis damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and around 250 000 people fled to a school run by over 100 UN members who had been converted into temporary shelters.
Tens of thousands of people still in protective custody and, in the course of the fights, school officials moved the beginning of the school last week.
"I hope that school will be opened soon and we will return to school, just as other children in the world and just as Jewish children do," said Mohammed Amara, 13-year-old, who lives in a school in Gaza City, where he lives.
According to the commonly used figure, housing prices have risen to the highest in the seven-year winter months of Australia.
The price price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic dwellings, which measured the prices of dwellings in the capital of Australia, increased by 1.1 per cent in August, showed the data of the RP on Monday.
The increase in prices during the summer, July and August period was 4.2 per cent, i.e. more than in the same month after 2007.
The annual price increase was 1 per cent, which is more than twice as many as during the 12 months preceding the previous 12 months of 2013 but prices have not risen steadily across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Däda’s research director Tim Lawless, Melbourne and Melbourne are at the top of the price increase.
RP Dita's results show that housing prices rose by 16.1 per cent in Sydney and 11.7 per cent in Melbourne the year before.
The housing markets of Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are next to the busiest; the average increase in prices is from five to six per cent.
The weakest housing markets are in Canberra, where prices rose by only 1.4 per cent per year following government expenditure cuts.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia will increase the number of dwellings on sale over the coming months, which will be the real reality of the housing market.
"In view of the increase in the sales of dwellings by dealers, the overall high rate of sales and the constant level of interest rates, it is likely that housing prices will continue to increase in the next three months", says Lawless.
The new Gösta Museum has drawn record holidays to Mäntä.
The new image and image art have drawn record audiences to Mäntta this summer.
By the end of August, more than 70 000 guests have visited the Serlachius Art Museum.
The Gösta Museum was opened in June and has been featured, among other things, in pop-art classics from Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, again, Mänttä’s week of photography told us that she had made a record of her visit this summer, after 14 500 visitors had visited the IK event this summer.
These figures have not been used to.
People have fallen out of doors and windows," says Pauli Sivonen, director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors per year will be approaching 100 000 in the Serlachius regions this year.
There have been some 40,000 visitors in previous years.
There are some 11,000 inhabitants in Mänttä-Vippula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä.
Museum Director Sivonen reminds us that the new museums are always opening up.
"The challenge is to make the manifestation permanent," he says.
It is therefore hoped that the season of art will continue far beyond the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened at the Art Museum.
The police are investigating four thefts in Kajani over the last few days.
On Sunday evening in the North of Langa, a window was breached by breaking the business property.
The unsub had received a small amount of money from the cashier.
Between Thursday and Monday, deep-season street had been stolen from the tank fuel of a truck.
Once again, between Sunday and Monday, the boat and its back engines had been taken from the rest of the boat's hive.
The rowing boat was the flag of the Falapalta on the outside of the light and from inside the basement.
In the interior, the text in the nocturnal part of the inside was written in the text "OVA."
A couple of suspects have already tried to catch up with the police.
On Sunday night, the commercial property was breached on the Tikkarupunk road.
A police dog got a trail and a 20-year-old palamen found himself hiding under a tree in the woods.
On Monday, the police caught another man from Paltamo, who is also suspected to have committed a one-off break.
The missing amphetamine brought a homicide in Kajani.
The disappearance of a minimum gram of amphetamine resulted in a murder charge for a Kaianist born in 1977.
According to the D.A., the man had gone to the apartment with his wife and another man and shot a woman, a 34-year-old Kayan woman, who was suspected to be a drug exporter, with a shotgun.
The defendant challenged the charge and was accused of being accompanied by another man as a shooter.
The incident was reported to the police when the police stopped the passenger car, where the company had been carrying clothes that were used in the blood work.
In addition to the burns, there was also a cut-off hake in the car.
The Court of First Instance shall rule on the case later on.
August was warm in many places.
According to the air science department, the average of the same warm readings will occur on average once in the 10th year.
The statistics of the airspace department show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In the majority of the country, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Due to the fires in July and August, all summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured during the first week of August in Pori, where the meter showed 33.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never moaned at me.
He never said that he would ever love me.
Henry was born to a seven-year-old immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley in the UK Midlands in 1958.
Henry's father worked at the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old, and his relationship with his father was far removed.
He is currently practicing for Rudy's Rare Records, a comedy show based partly on an imaginary discussion with his father and developed on the basis of a series of Radio 4 channels.
There is a mixture of rhinestone and raspberry in the incubation chambers.
Henry has had to go through painful childhood memories.
She's been in therapy several times since her mother died, and she's been thinking about her relationship with her father a lot.
Dad was very hard to read.
Never seen his face, only the voice said, "Stop the noise."
Take it easy on your father.
Move!
I'm looking at the cricket now.
My parents, Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, visited my father in the pub and discussed, for example, the form of a living or the beauty of a skating job.
I never spoke to him about such things.
For the most part of my life, he was to me in the corner of the man with the filth, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal beam in Dudley and got this idea of what his father's life must have been like, although the working conditions are now better than they were at that time.
The boilers are now a little brighter, but they are basically dark, smokey, Labyrinth-like depths, with flames, smoke and bright, which make you feel better.
Dad used to take a bath and just land in the bathtub, and slowly he started to sing himself by washing away the dirt of the melter from himself.
As I walked around the mill, I realized that he had worked for years to get us food at the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry’s race was still lacking in the closeness provided by parents.
My father never mourned or ever said that he would love me.
It wasn't until my mother started to get sick a little before we started to repeat each other's love for each other.
She has a Billie cousin with Dawn French, and through her own child she has been able to share the love she was missing as a child.
You have to repeat "I love you" all the time.
Come on, now, you're hugging me.
Dad, I'm 22 years old.
Dawn French and Dawn French.
Why wouldn't we be friends?
She's a wonderful mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why wouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
It was also one of the reasons that led to mother's death.
When I began to suffer from excessive overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor told me to make a complete translation.
Then I started to work out a lot, and I also had to start a rough diet for my reasons.
It's very difficult –
and boring.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's well-known short beard pictured his change during career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics from Othello, he is encroached in making a theater.
The next step was the comedy of the Errors and the Fences (Aids) of August.
The making of the theatre offers a different experience than the citcoms and comedys that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started in the field when he was only 16 years old at the factory.
One of the dishes caught him doing imitations on the stage and contacted the New Faces Competition.
Henry's TV career started in the mid-70s. "How long was I the only black impersonator and comedian on TV?" he says.
He learned to do his job.
I was supposed to grow up in the light of the public, I had to learn how to make jokes in the slide strap between 1975 and 1985, while living a purpose and being on TV. It was a very difficult time.
Lenny New Faces Competition in 1975
Henry's manager had the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show in which people appeared to be dirty makeup, so he ended up in a comics program for five years.
My family didn't like it.
On the other hand, I wish I had never participated in it, but I do not regret it.
Although my position was strange and offensive, I was able to work on huge events and learn how to deal with the public.
Then "Britti-TV awarded, multiannual favorite and light entertainment show" was at the same time "a bright parod of black people."
Henry worked in the second comedy series in the '80s, where both the prank and the black British culture were created.
The first episode of The Lenny Henry Show was shown in 1984, and in the 90s, Henry was known as the character chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series.
He spent the following decade with ads, IDs, TV series and film parts, but after his LennyHenry.tv show at the BBC in 2008, he said to himself: "What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems that you're just going to be on site or on sidelines."
The next item was the Radio 4 Channel Document Series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part of the discussion was on Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It wasn't really taught us well at school, and I think it belonged to a white middle class that wears tights and has money.
That's why the Shakespeare theme raised fear in me.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: "Test me.
Don't forget the whole idea until you know what you're talking about.
Meet words and understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Declare 20 letters on Othello's last speech for the document and he was sold.
I felt like I could do this.
It felt almost as if some part of me had been missing before, and now it was put in place.
"That's what this is about, this is important, so take it seriously, learn your line, do a little background check.
So the training process was tough, and I read the play for months before it was implemented.
The play was finally a success.
Apparently, it was expected to fail, but it didn't exactly happen.
Shortly thereafter, Henry played the main part in the Comedy of the Errors.
Suddenly I played in the British National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought of the idea: "Oh, you've changed.
There were technical problems in the play once, and Henry clearly felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice in my mind said to me: 'You must take 10 minutes alone until the computer works again."
Instead, the guide’s assistant announced that the proposal would start as soon as the problem had been corrected.
I walked out of the stage, and part of me looked at the relief.
That is not my responsibility,
I can leave it to the others.
"You're part of the play, stay in your position."
The "Fences" show in Duchess Theatre.
Moving the mountains to the "Fences" show was a challenge.
Panic is a good thing, it makes man more reliable.
This play was also well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; "This is what you have to do."
Henry says this, of course, with the voice of VONALLA.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I work in training rooms.
Henri, however, is still basically a comedian: small humorouss interrupt our discussions on a continuous basis in his exchange of imitations from one to another.
Withholding from the Stand-Up Commision is a question of intent, while giving immediate thanks to an unknown public seems dangerous.
If you keep thirsting for it, it could lead to a dead end.
I sometimes spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels like it does, but in general it doesn't cheer me up the way it used to.
I'm asking him if he's going to go on a new stand-up tour anymore.
It is a real pleasure for me to sit together with a guide who will help shape the beginning, mid- and end of the whole way, and I do not believe that I will ever want to give up that feeling.
So this is his new rebirth?
I think so.
I like acting...
It's really fun.
There's a story in the show that tells a story, and there's a lot of entertainment to do.
I love stories.
They love stories.
Who will establish a register of officials in order to remove "smuggling workers"
Who has begun to establish a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove "magic workers" from government wage lists?
Workers who did not register for the next two weeks would no longer be paid, the Government’s information was reported.
The government doubts that thousands will be paid to them after they have left their official duties.
President Uhuru Kenyata promised to eliminate public sector corruption after entering office in 2013.
In the previous year's audit, at least one million dollars per month were spent on the wages and other economic abuses of "smuggling workers".
The government suspects that salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left his official duties, the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri reports the capital of Nairobi.
All officials should report themselves to the register in the identification centres over the next few weeks, in order to ensure that their data is stored in biometric registration format, were reported in the Government’s press release.
According to the action taken, anyone who does not do this without due cause will be removed from the salary lists.
"This measure will significantly rationalise the public sector, as it will determine how many people really work, and it will also clean up wage lists at both levels of the government, thus resolving the problem of "smuggling workers", says Anne Waiguru, official of the Office of the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The profit for the 2015 financial year of the Seinjoki River may remain EUR 25,5 million in deficit unless the city adjusts its operations and expenditure in a tight economic situation.
On the basis of the current budget preparation, the annual budget is running for some 9.4 million years.
Possible tools of efficiency were the provision of services, the purchase of services, the sale of assets and grants, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
The total target of EUR 10 million for investment is EUR 8.5 million.
The situation of municipalities is not eligible for relief.
The new obligations imposed on municipalities, insufficient growth in tax revenues, rising unemployment and the 5% reduction in government shares will further undermine the prospects.
The purpose of the economic seminar is to find new ways of balancing the economy.
The Board of Directors agrees that savings must be made.
The ship must turn to its objective, says Kimmo Heinonen, Chairman of the Government of the Government.
The Board of Directors of the Board of Directors was informed of the proposals made by the Board of Directors for preparation.
The proposals of the Board of Governors are the basis for the preparation of the budget at the Board's economic seminar in Fram on Monday 8 September.
After the Board of Governors seminar, the draft budget will go to the Board of Governors and the City Council through the Board of Governors.
Tens of Turkish police officers were arrested as suspected of being "driving" against the government.
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in the Turks, suspected of "the anti-government plot", reported by local media.
The police did not immediately comment on the matter.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior police officers were held among the arrests.
Some of the police were involved in last December's corruption investigations involving government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several police officers were arrested in Turkey for organising large-scale crime and tracking of telephones.
President of President Recep Tayyip Erdoga (who served as the Prime Minister during this period) said that police activities were part of the planned actions of the Islamic Director-General of Fethuah Gullen against him and others in power.
Not all children will be going to school in the region.
Main Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk also took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told unexpected journalists that not all schools had reopened, but said he was committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremony of the first day of September was not held in every school.
There is no peace in the whole of the region.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole huge Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who is the lead teacher at Slavianski School, where Yatsenuk's daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will come back here and that children will be able to learn lessons that will benefit them in the future.
The first day’s celebration includes the children’s traditionally written shirts, balloons and the giving of flowers to teachers.
According to Perry of Texas, the defamatory twitis was unauthorised.
On Sunday evening, an agitating picture of the democratic district attorney was sent from a Twitter account established by Governor Rick Perry of Texas in the middle of this hearing the accusations of abuse of power.
The Tweet was removed later and followed by a new Tweet, where Perry swore that he had nothing to do with the picture.
Tweetti was unauthorisedly sent to my account.
"I don't approve of the Tweet, and I've removed it," said the later publication.
Perry's background forces did not respond immediately to clarification requests.
Although the Tweets were sent from Perry's established Twitter account, it is unclear who published the picture.
The first twite contained an abusive picturing picture of Travis' district attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunk in April 2013.
Perry stopped financing the Lehmberg's office when he refused to resign, resulting in a large jury meeting in Austin this month in the case of Perry. Perry is a possible candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of Tweet was: "I don't always drive drunk, I don't always drive with three times more than allowed proms... but when it happens, I'm governor Perry for finger-reporting."
I am the most human demon in the world.
The Group Office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
The investigation was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antionio, who was appointed by the Republican judge.
Perry has stated that he was innocent and called the accusations a political run.
His powerful legal counsel has asked the judge to dismiss the accusations and said that the law under which the governor most often in office in Texas was accused is unclear on the basis of the Constitution.
Perry cut down $7.5 million of State aid to the State Public Inviolence Unit, which operates in the region of Travis and handles public sector charges when Lehmberg refused to resign.
Perry's decision was received by the Monitoring Group on the left to issue a formal complaint on the matter.
The established Twitter account of Perry is regularly updated — and sometimes well known.
After reaching the fifth place at the Iowa election meeting during its 2012 presidential campaign, Perry threatened to stop playing the game by publishing a picture of himself flying around the lake with the text "Here comes South Carolina!" in the box.
Berkeley says that the housing market is once again "normal".
One of London's main builders has warned that the housing market in South-East England has "returned" to a normal level of activity.
The capital London housing has been plagued by huge demand and sharp price increases, while the fear of a widespread credit gap has led the Bank to set restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
The founder of a high-level builder at Berkeley and Chairman Tony Pidgley said on Monday that "from the beginning of the marketing year, the market and the number of transactions have returned to normal since 2013" and added that this has enabled "a stable environment".
During the recession, the London housing market went well in the pursuit of foreign investors to the capital.
According to the country register data, the prices of dwellings in the city rose by 18.5 per cent only in the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average of England and Wales, which was 6.7 per cent.
The average sales prices of Berkeley's private, affordable and student buildings increased in the fifth year preceding, reaching a price increase of 423 000 pounds by the end of April.
However, strengthened pounds have made London's real estate less attractive in recent months - some of the interest has also been influenced by new real estate taxes and statutory rhetoric on possible "kartano tax" before the general elections in May.
Last week, the London real estate agent Foxtons warned that the April mortgage loan report, which reported tighter loan orders, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in terms of sales and prices of real estate during the second half of the year.
On Monday, recent data from the bank indicated that the volume of loans accepted fell in July, indicating a cooling housing market.
The real estate agent Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast for London's real estate prices, according to which prices will fall by three per cent, because the index measuring the houseowner's opinion on prices has already started to decrease slightly.
The number of transactions in the most expensive areas of London in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has fallen by one quarter from one year ago, real estate broker WA Ellis reports.
However, home demand in the capital is a blessing to Berkeley, which increased income from the sale of real estate to more than GBP 2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that "the demand for a well-designed, correct product has remained stable at the best location, and therefore sales have remained lively".
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year before April, which is nearly a third more than during the peak of the economic crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits rose by 40 per cent year-on-year by GBP 380 million and turnover by 18 per cent to GBP 1.6 million.
On Monday, before the company's annual meeting, Pidgley reported that Berkeley's annual earnings correspond to current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the total annual tax revenue is GBP 450 million.
Berkeley's share sold evenly on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon at a price of 23,96 pounds.
The hacker leaked data from the branch Lawrence's traverses into the network.
Lawrence arrives at the 85th Annual Academy Awards Awards Awards ceremony.
A hacker who claimed to hold a hundred other star images leaked from the web by the viewer Jennifer Lawrence.
The Starfly Star representative confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker's "insolent privacy harm".
Contact has been made with the authorities, and anyone who publishes the stolen photos of FF Lawrence will receive accusations.
The images originally published on the 4chan photo page appear to have ended in the wrong hands because of the weakness of the Apple iCloud storage system. A hundred other hacks are said to be on the list of ten other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardash, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It is not known how much of the images are true, although Scott Pilgrim versus the World Star Winstead condemned the hacking to know.
"To those who look at the pictures taken by me and my husband in private years ago: hopefully you will be pleased", Winstead Twitwish said.
However, the 'iCarly' and 'Victorious' series of 'Vitctorious' by Nickodeon, which, however, denied the authenticity of the pictures and said, 'These so-called imagery images of me are of me, don't you understand?'
Let me finish this right from the start .
BuzzFéden announced at late Sunday that the representative of pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the images of the star.
The new novel, which is about love and a letter of J, which is the only novel that we have received thanks from the King Jacobson.
They slided, it pictured the best of what happened, at first they untied each other like a cardboard box that was left out of the rain.
Only occasionally he heard from the woman that it was too serious, too laborious, intense, untied, and perhaps a bit of a sticky.
That's when he swinged the left hand.
He recognized all of them.
Yeah, he was a tweezer, like a silk.
The last victim of his mark had been an initial relationship, which, however, had been promising; it seemed that this relationship could have helped to ease his lonely boredom and could have brought even something into his life.
Ailin's Solomons had irrefutable hair and he was a delicately tender beauty with a joyful heart, from a northern village that was even rougher and further away than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older traveler who Kevern thought was her aunt. She had inherited the house that was in the wet but modern valley, and the name of the valley was appropriately the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, there were spiders in all the bathrooms, the etans had left behind in the windows, the whole place in their own, the garden was full of weeds that resembled the giant kaleheads.
The cottage was like children's fairy tales, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
The author’s story: Book Jacobson, whose novel "J" is candidates for the Booker Literary Prize in 2014.
The conditions will be published next week.
Kiver had been sitting in the middle of a long hay with Ailin in the middle of a broken terrace chair, enjoying an amazingly warm spring afternoon, listening with a loud voice, through which the whole country heard relaxing music and calming news when the crosses of Ailin’s shoes brought to Keverni’s mind a song that had long been heard by a long-forgotten black character and often heard by his father’s playful fools downstairs.
Your leg is too big.
Such songs were basically too aggressive and were no longer played in the receiver.
They were not prohibited — nothing was actually forbidden — but they were not called anymore.
They were meant to be left to forget, as the word itself never did.
The public reached what had not been achieved by law and declaration: just as people in the field of literature chose to read the memories, cookbooks and romances of heroes, for music they prefer the ballads.
In the afternoon, Keverin began to play with an imaginary piano and sing a serenade to the big legs of Ainni with a horrid consummation of voice.
Ailin didn't understand.
"It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller," Kevern told him, and, by the way, raised two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was how his father had always done before the letter "j" was able to escape his lips.
It had started as a battle between him and Dad while he was small.
He told me he was playing the same game with his own father.
If you let the word "j" out of your mouth and you didn't remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you had to pay for the penis.
It wasn't very funny then, and it wasn't even now.
He knew it was expected from him, that's all.
I understood what jazz was about.
I had never heard of that before.
The jazz had not really been declared a ban, but it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was only one chance in life for one word.
When the song started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
There had been a similar course of impertinence.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was the embezzlement of jazz through music.
By the 10 years that Ever had not heard Sammy eating Junior, jazz music had become familiar to him through his former half of the CD collection.
Well, at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Considering the age of Ailin, it was likely that he did not remember the time when popular singers were not black.
Even so, there was no need for laws or forcing.
The famous society meant that each of its parts was gratefully accepted — gratefully grateful — that they were as saved as luck in trade — the principle that each group did natural things to it.
Based on their temperature and physical characteristics, African-Cabian relatives are best suited to entertaining and sports, so they sang and ran.
Originally originating in the Indian continent, they were, as such, gifted with electrical equipment, so it was their job to make sure that each family had an active telephone that was used to handle matters.
Those who remained in the Polish community worked as pipelines; the last Greeks broke the platform.
When it came to the truth, those from the Gulf of Persia and the Middle East who had not fled quickly, their grandparents, who had not fled in fear that they would be accused of burning flames and fear that they would be caught up next, opened up food stores, where Labneh lawyers were offered and burned down, and their lives would look down on the ground, created and depressed.
Let each act according to his rules.
All I had heard was the ballads, and he was hard to understand how the offensive words that Keverni had just sang could never have been put on as music.
Through music, the spirit was expressed as an expression of music.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except in the opinion of the obsessives,
My father never hurt anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already gone too far, but an abandoned forest created an illusion of safety.
No word would pass through the sound insulation of the massy cranberry leaves.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why did your father do something like that?
He was going to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he didn't want to put two fingers on his face with Alinn.
I think I thought he was weird already.
"My father thought it was fun", he said instead.
Alinn was disbelieving his head, and his hair was covered in Kevern's eyes.
There's nothing to see in the world but the huge, shaky hair softness of the air.
There's nothing else he'll ever see.
"If that's what you're saying," he said, but he didn't sound convinced.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
I was supposed to be genuinely confused.
My legs are so big?
He looked at it.
Your head isn't really big.
Your ankle, maybe, a little...
And you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
For you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"You're attractive to me because of your fat ankles," he tried to fix things.
I'm twisted in that sense.
This didn't help.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was quite different, because he, like his father, lacked that convincing charm to control the truth of the lie.
Maybe his father was meant to be true.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to do the same.
Despite the gentleness of his mind,
Ailin Solomons froze and rose from a terrace chair and poured a receiver and shiny wine they had just drank.
The wine was made only from the back of the back, so it was not possible for him to use it as a reason for the crash.
In his nervousness, he seemed to be shaking like palm tree leaves in a storm.
"And your fat head is what I am wretchedly attracted to you," he said...
Except I don't think so.
Kivern was sorry for Ailin, both because of his own unnecessary cruel words and because of the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailin decided to stand up against him.
Did Ailinn think he'd hit you?
He had never told Kevern about life in a good north island where he had grown, but Kevern was sure that basically it was similar to life here.
It's the same big, old sea that waved against them.
The same confused men, although after the fallout, even more pale and gnarly than their smuggler and decomposing parents, walked from the pub to the pub, were ready to hit every woman who dared to resist or tease them.
Big head?
He'd see a fat fist if he wasn't careful.
Ingest first – kissing had become the most common word for the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the antidote to the insignificant love cylinders pumping out the receiver – inhale first and then attack.
Keverni thought it was too much, too, because already the instigation itself was hostile.
The body body of Ailin Solomons encouraged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace chair like an old man.
Ainn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kevern's grief surprised him.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
I was going to follow him — just as his traveler watched Kevern go from the window upstairs — a man who was himself responsible for his serious life.
Adam from the garden, he'll think about it.
He felt compassion for Keverni and men in general, even though some of them had raised their hands against him in order to strike him.
A man who turned his back, cumbersome, disgraced, defeated, lost all the will of battle – why did he feel that he was so familiar with that vision, even though he did not remember that he had once again seen such a moment before this moment?
While Ailin Solomons was alone again, she looked at her feet.
A few years before the recent event described, smart and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked in a general opinion-gathering private institution in Ofnow, did a brief study on the existence of a small and mediocre violence in the areas of the country where the crackdown or the end of the violence was likely to occur, taking into account the money and energy used to eliminate it.
"A lot has already been achieved, and much remains to be done," he wrote, "to balance thousands of years of struggle and, most often, the natural aggression of the winning people, especially in abandoned and remote holes, where, despite the church-books that go beyond hedges, human survival is rare in the past.
However, some things cannot be completely removed.
The higher the tower, the lower its moods are its moods.
There is a public cry among sentimental ballets, anointing stories of the triumphs and swearing in the name of the benefits of marriage and family life, but, at the same time, a persistent cruelty will keep both rural communities and urban cohabiting, and there is also evidence of a new, more inhospitable conflict in homes, workplaces, streets and even in playgrounds.
"You must regret the tendency to dramatise", his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
The first Nussbaum laid eyes on the ground.
In addition, I have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that question," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbo?
Esme appealed to the court to refrain from answering personal questions.
How's it going?
Once again, silence.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said, "because I oppose atheism, lesbian sexuality and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of an impeccable society.
Although a certain degree of hypersensitivity is, in itself, totally acceptable and transparent, it can sometimes lead to distorted results, such as what you just presented to me.
Obviously, you have something against the church — and what you call a blasphemy or an outrage, others usually call a natural energy and a natural force.
The consultation on what happened yesterday, if it happened in general, would destroy the country's fundamental vital vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked over at Rabanowitz's speech.
Behind the head of Rabinowitz, the Flaming-Pink LED light announced a guide that Ofnow had distributed to the country over the past quarter or more of the previous century.
Smile for your neighbor, dear partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, don't agree, please, please.
Talking is better than silence, and the voiced word is better than written, but nothing wins the truth.
"I understand well what you want to say," Esme Nussbaum replied in silence when it was certain that his director had stopped, "and I just want to say that we are not as effective as we think we are being.
I am concerned that if we are not warned, we will find that we are repeating the same mistakes that originally led to SIH, which is where I am, and where I am.
This time, though, we will not pour out our lies and our mistrusts to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his fingers.
This gesture meant endless patience.
"I'm going too far," he said, "as you pictured "a mistake", the actions that our grandparents may have done or not done.
You are also going too far in saying that they poured out "his hatred and mistrust for others".
In such a way as you should not be reminded that when it comes to understanding the past or defending the present, we are not talking about 'we' or 'they'.
There was no "we" or "other".
It was a time of chaos, that's all we know about it.
"If we're right, in that chaos," Esme was afraid to go on, "no society can say that he behaved well.
There's no one to blame.
What was done, what was done, whether it was good or bad.
That's when it is.
There is no need to talk about it anymore – we agree on this.
And just as it is inappropriate to share accusations, there is no need to make corrections, whether they are justified or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But for what is the past, then, if not learned from it --
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more thing--
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
"I'm going through your report," he said, and indicated that it was time for Esmen to leave.
The next day, as usual, he was hit by a biker driving on the sidewalk, who was described by passersby as "evilly and fiercely" by the passersby.
Events are happening.
The Lesotho army is denying the planned blow; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa.
The Polish army officials have denied that they had framed the attack on the government and said that they were acting against a police officer who was suspected of trying to arm themselves against political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country, saying that the army had surrounded his official residence and took over government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The Head of State traveled with his family to a neighboring country in South Africa after telling him that he had been shot dead.
Major Ntlele Noto, a military representative, banned the attack and said that the army answered this threat from "political fanatics." The police have been said to have tried to arm the fanatics.
"The Los Angeles Defence Forces took action after receiving a number of intelligence that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they were ready to cause problems," he told the Voice of America Newspaper Office.
According to the President of the Government of South Africa, Mr. Clayson Monyela, military actions seemed to be a revolutionary attempt.
"Although no one has claimed to have overturned the government by force, the activities of the Lesocho Defence Forces show all sorts of signs of a revolutionary attempt," he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho army, soldiers return to their camps on Sunday, and the capital had a peaceful atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will lead the government in the absence of Thabane.
Thabane says that he believes that he is under attack because he has tried to fight corruption.
There have been tensions in Lesotho since June, when Thabane interrupted the session of the Parliament because of the differences in the government of the great coalition.
He thus denies the power of the government, although alleged otherwise, he denies the power of the government.
Newspaper: Microsoft will set up a data centre in Uusimaa.
The IT company Microsoft has set up a large data center in Uusimaa, a place where the company refuses to specify its location.
When sending information to Microsoft's media, the company notes that it does not tell the location of all its data centers for safety reasons.
According to Microsoft, the Centre is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars for Microsoft.
The audience had previously been bet on Oulu or Kayan.
Microsoft completely terminates its Oulu office, which takes about 500 people to work.
All in all, Microsoft has announced that it will give rise to a maximum of 1 050 jobs in Finland.
Camilla Lindfors, Director-General of Microsoft, tells STT that the company does not comment on the number of staff employed by the new data center.
The Data Centre was established in the U.S.A., which was informed by Newspaper on Monday.
The man is accused of assaulting the traffic lights.
A 78-year-old man is accused of taking a three-year-old view of a traffic lighting fire in Fife.
Gordon Stewart is accused of taking over the view in the vicinity of Pistween in the East Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart drove his Audi Q3 car with caution and caused injury to a girl.
Stewart, 78 from Auteri, banned charges during the meeting of the sheriff of Dundee.
Sheriff Charles Manar QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
Four tips for better underwater images and videos.
If you want to take a picture or video under water, you will have a choice between several options.
The best option is a waterproof, compact point-and-shot camera, such as Nikon Coolpixel AW120 or action camera, such as Go Pro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are about $300.
I personally took these photos from my family by using a number of different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
No matter what the device is, there are rules that you should follow.
Always check your device twice every time.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other parts are closed watertightly.
In addition, set the camera's description settings to match the image or video that is acceptable.
Some cameras or combinations of cameras and video cameras have a regulation to optimize the conditions under water.
In addition, before you jump into the water, make sure you know how far your device can take.
Some cameras last only 5 feet deep, while others last 50 to 60 feet deep.
Check out both normal and waterproof models in our shopping guide and digital cameras reviews.
Take several pictures – many of them will try in some way.
There is a LCD screen in the compact cameras that allows you to frame the image, whereas the action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see under water, and the compilation of a picture can either succeed or fail.
So take several pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows for a grip, which means taking multiple images at a time with different settings, use this feature.
Be close to the surface.
The light will decrease significantly more deeply.
If possible, stay close to the surface while photographing a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This way you'll also get more colors for your images; the deeper you go, the less colors you'll see.
Try to get close to the object you're describing.
This is an important advice when describing the ground, but even more important under water, because the conditions of light are limited.
It is very important when there is an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of view, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object in order to fill the whole image with frames.
China will not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear revenge.
The Chinese Parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing lack of concern about democratic reform.
It is likely that the plan will allow the long-awaited protesters in Hong Kong to design and implement demonstrations only hours after the publication of the decision by activists in the long-awaited business district of Hong Kong.
In practice, the decision of the Congress of the People's Party to give the Communists the power to rule out any candidate who does not obey Beijing.
"This was expected, but it's still intimidating," says the president of the democratic party, legislative director Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They have lied to Hong Kongers.
It is clear that we are working with the sovereign regime.
Li Fei, Deputy Secretary-General of the Committee on People's Congress in the People's Republic of China, defended the Chinese administration, saying that a general candidate in the election of the Director of Hong Kong would be too "cathotic".
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed over Hong Kong to China, Beijing promised the people of the region that it would have to choose its own management company from 2017 onwards.
According to the leaders, the Sunday decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the electoral process through the electoral committee managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be accepted.
The summer before the end of the summer in Hong Kong, some of the largest and most significant protests in the region took place over the years.
The campaign for the defence of democracy was largely behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which has been threatened by the organisers to prevent the activity of the business district if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine universal right to vote.
On Sunday, just hours after the publication of the decision, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in rain before the main government buildings in Hong Kong.
In the memory of the movement's operators, they announced that the movement would move to a new era of non-occupation and that they would create protestary waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently, fear that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In their information published online, the operators said that "the movement considers the Occupy Central stamp to be the last means to be introduced only if there is no hope for dialogue and no other way".
We are very sorry to announce that today's last chance of dialogue has gone out and the centre's power will take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday, the security measures were close to the government’s main buildings, including police and barricades.
In Hong Kong, the restlessness feeds many people the feeling that the residents are slowly losing control of their power.
The wave from the mainland has caused competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of expression, will disappear under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement because its protests threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions — the business world.
"The protest they are talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people take part and how long it will last," says legislator Regina Ip, who has long appreciated the movement.
We do not want to see to it that Hong Kong is falling out of our grip.
the image would be bad for investment.
There are also stories in the media of the state of China that Hong Kong's democratic activists are the moors of the violent Western powers of the revolution.
This summer, activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, involving 780 000 people – more than a fifth of the Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations in favour of democracy in the region.
The U.S. prom traditional hits British universities: new students have private cars for private cars.
We are thrilled to respond to the demand by establishing the first luxury British travel form for students today.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also provides other vehicles, such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable possible arrival at the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a safety aspect in the service.
The service is the best option for students who would otherwise drag their property across the country in loaded cars.
When this is combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide students today with as easy and high quality transport as possible to the university.
According to a representative, reservations have not yet been received because the service has just been established, but added that "students will start to order in the coming weeks.
The company believes that there is a demand for service, even though most students pay £9,000 per year.
Today's students are very different from their expectations and hopes from those started 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Now is more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is exactly the right way to do it.
However, the National Association criticises a service that is not realistic.
According to the Vice-President of the University of the Organization, Megan Dunn, "this service plan seems to be really far off from the lives of the student majority.
Many of their studies this month are starting to lose sight of the cost of living when the financial subsidies offered in the form of loans and grants have fallen short of the excellent increase in basic living costs, and the next thing you can think about is where thousands of people could be used for as simple a matter as coming to the campus.

Basketball: Fan encouragement too much: Sasu Salin had passed out on the field.
The basketball Sasu Salin was today the incarnation of Finland's victory.
He was able to forget the depth of his US match and tossed the blood of Ukraine during the second half of his sedentary solutions.
But Salin transferred all the credit to the susifans and did it in a sense:
I was about to fall out on that field at the end, and that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, my mist, there was nothing to do with it.
The noise and the white ocean were too much for me.
The power moments at the Hall contained nine surfaces in a speedy pace, ball-breakers, plates and temmel everywhere that happened.
I don't know how that happened, but I got into one of those Flow states that everything worked out.
They're just coming from something sometimes, right now, in an insanely important place, Sasu was glowing.
That's my role.
Do all that stuff.
I'm glad to see that others have caught up with the plot, too.
It grabbed the whole gang.
Salin is a team's piano and spirit, so it is no wonder that his mask lifted the whole team to a flight that was too large and hard-knived in Ukraine for five too many.
Finland's World Cup 32 years after the break: The past was left with the mind of a gross hit.
Heikki Montonen (oik.) was the main coach in Finland at the World Cup tournament in Argentina in 1982.
It's been 32 years since Finland's men's flight to the land team played the last time in the World Cup tournament.

Kosone and Parkkali remember the tournament as if yesterday: it was a fiery fight against France in the early stages.
"At that match in the finals, the game was rough," recalled Kosonen.
We had already won, and both teams had already settled down the line.
Suddenly, the game continued.
We lost it in 2-3, and then the passersby went crazy even more," said Parkkali.
Finland played head coach Heikki Montos in command and was ranked last year.
Finland is now again among the world's choices, as the Polish World Cup tournament is on Saturday morning.
Many things have changed radically in international aviation over the course of 32 years.
The strengths of the owners are about the same as before, but the quality and skills are now more high.
The average length of the players has also increased.
The game is faster than ever", think about Parkkali.
But what about Poland?
The gamer in Finland has expanded and the burden can be shared.
I expect Finland to reach the end of the first block.
Then you can get tight", you can judge Kosene.

In Norway, Finnish tourists saved Cita-dog from mountain in Norway, saying, "These men deserve all the gratitude."
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelen and his dogs fell down on the mountains on Thursday, Antti and Tuomo Soini offered brave aid.
This weekend, Mikkelen was looking for "International heroes" on Facebook to thank his help again.
Mikkelen reported in public Facebook update that his Cita-dog, who was with him on the mountains on Thursday, hurt his pocket.
An injured dog could no longer be able to erupt in a steep landscape.
I tried to carry it myself, but I couldn't, so I had to let it go.
I tried many times to lure and pull it a little further, but its feet didn't just carry it, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelen, the aid did not come from the police, from a nearby hotel or from passersby.
In the dark of the night, the situation started to appear to be an authority.
There were two walkers who were willing to help — Antti Soni from Tampere and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway on the Galdh øpiggen and headed for their camp as they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain slope.
(Mikelen) was relatively calm with regard to the situation.
We offered to help him with his dog, Antti Soini will tell him in a message to the Evening Sanom.
Soon there was also a German man who was carrying a roamer with him.
A few of the types of animals to which the injured dog was attached were sent from the bench to Cita.
The Germanman came here a moment after us when we thought about what to do with the dog and carried the dog with a moment of arms down the slope, Soini tells us.
NAME: Tuomo Soini
Dogs could be carried down by means of a travelling rug.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but the carrying on of difficult land was slow.
However, after about one and a half hours, Cita was able to get well down.
After the incident, Mikkelen was still looking for "International heroes" on Facebook to thank you again for doing this again.
Soyni replied to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unmistakable.
I don't know what I would have done without these heroes, but Mikkelen is happy.
If they hadn't helped me, we wouldn't have come back.
I'd like to find these people, because I feel like I didn't thank them enough.
They certainly don't know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all thanks and honor, I am eternally eternal to them.
On the night before Monday, the Soys were already on their way home.
They had been given the happy news from Mikkelen: - Cita said she was feeling better already.

The genetic abnormality is often misdiagnosed.
The British woman was afraid of years of dying because of false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of his youth that he only had a few years of life left because he had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth’s disease (CMT), which means a series of hereditary diseases that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
According to the Charity CMT UK Certificate Organisation, false diagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, as they are known to be so low.
It is estimated that around 23 000 people in the United Kingdom suffered from CMT disease that caused symptoms in motors, such as muscle weakness, severe walking and toes spout.
The disease can also cause feelings or pain, and it is healing and progressive, which means that the symptoms are getting worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was ill with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), which has a really bad survival rate.
Rodgers believed that he would go to a wheelchair before he turned 18, and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, the mother of 51-year-old two children says, "When I was a child, I knew I couldn't do the same things as the others.
I fell daily, and I took longer than anything else.
I was never able to skate or skate with other children, and I was bullied at school because I walked and ran in different ways than the others.
With Rodgers in his 13-year-old, he was subjected to a number of abstinence surgeries in order to complete his feet. In the case of surgery, the doctor left the room and immediately looked at his research papers, which said that he had an infection with Fa.
"I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I came home, I came home from the library and wrote to the F.A.," he says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and panicky.
I thought I was going to be in a wheelchair by 18 years and I'm going to die before I turned 25, and in the meantime, I'm going to lose my full function.
I went through this for myself and planned my own funeral.
Rodgers says that by the age of 17, he said that his suffering had not deteriorated as much as he thought and asked his doctor about this.
The doctor just picked me up and said, "girl, I don't think you have this disease because otherwise you'd already be in a wheelchair.
I think you're suffering from something far less dangerous.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
"When I was told what a CMT disease was, I thought I'd been delayed," he says.
The Charity CMT UK organises a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

Koönen: We have a good chance of winning.
The wishes of the basketball team from the rest of the world will be at stake when Finland meets today at the second match of the World Cups in Ukraine.
If the opening loss had been expected for the United States, Ukraine would once again belong to the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits to the next location.
Ukraine is a good gang, but I think we have a good chance of winning, Petter Koponen's prognosis.
On Saturday, the first match of the competitions struck the Dominican Republic 72-62.
The team will be coached by the NBB veteran Mike Fratello, in whose command Ukraine will play aggressive basketball.
The key player in Ukraine is Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, the head of the game, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is a hundred meters from the world's top three years ago.
The Dominican Republic against Jeter threw 16 points.
Pooh Jeter is a fast guy, but yes, we've been played against them before, and we need to get our standard defense back together, Koponen said.
Hanno Möllä promised that Finland would be better off than in his last loss to the United States.
We need to re-establish our own strengths.
I can guarantee you that there will be a normal pack of wolves in the field, Möllä said.
The claims of the Hollywood stars are spread online - part confirmed as genuine.
There are a number of broadcasts on the Internet that are claimed to be advocating well-known public figures.
Among other things, actor Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "global campaign".
The TMZ website has published an angry comment by Lawrence's representatives, which seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a gross violation of privacy.
Contact has been made to the authorities, and anyone who publishes (in the Internet) stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be charged, threatened by representatives.
According to TMZ, the actor Mary Elizabeth Orstead has confirmed that pictures of him are real.
He had taken these pictures with his husband years ago.
When I know that those pictures were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what a terrible trouble was seen for this purpose.
I have a feeling of sympathy for anyone who was the victim of hacking, he writes according to the website.
Instead, the actor Victoria Justice speaks of images that go by her own name as fake.
There are also real or fake nuisances on the move at least from Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grande, Hope Solo, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsk and Teresa Palmer.
The Honka-Major criticized himself: "Don't work hard enough to get you out of here".
Football Association FC Honka is currently in the last position of the Fleet League.
Painter Walter Viita's comments after the Sunday VPS review illustrate a very confusing situation.
I haven't had a goalie coach in four months.
Of course, everything has to adapt," Viitala said after the struggle that ended with the 1-2 kill.
Honka made a lot of defence mistakes, especially during the first half of the game.
Maalivar Viitala was not pleased about bad defence protection.
The public transport in Hong Kong has been busy this summer, and therefore the defenders in front of Viil have also changed at the turn of time.
As a result of the gambling game, many young players have also gained opportunities that they might not even deserve.
"Some people don't work hard enough to get you out of here once in a while", five grand, without a single player.
Hefki Kuqi, Head Coach of Honga, agreed to some extent with Viivi in the opinion of Shefki Kuqi.
"After the game, I told certain players that if you come to trainings and games, you'd have fun and you think you're a betting league player, and you don't have to work, so you're probably on the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I've given many young people a chance to play.
If they don't want to take that place and take advantage of it, it's not my fault.
Kuqi also recalled, however, that players cannot be expected to have an immediate success when playmates change constantly.
This period has not been twice the same as the present period.
In particular, the people in the defence have been changed.
That is the main reason why we are at this point", Kuqi said.
Honka is a serial jumbo, equal to the last TPS after the VPS battle.
There are still seven rounds left in the Fleet League, so there is still time for the espollates to avoid falling down to One.
I've never dropped a team before, and I'm not gonna hang out now.
We will never fall out of this series," goalkeeper Vitala said.
Lars von Trier has been doing a TV show after decades of break.
Film director Lars von Trier is planning to return to being the author of television series.
The Danish director prepares the TV series called The House That Jack Build.
The serial project was reported by Louise Vesth, who was the producer of Trier's films, on Monday at the Venice Film Festival.
According to the information provided by the producer company Zentropa, a series of descriptions should start in 2016.
Trier will be told about the manuscript work of the next series starting from this autumn.
The string is in English.
In the press release, Trier’s long-term partner, Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known as Peter Aalbæk Jensen, is also a source of information about a mysterious project.
According to him, a similar series "has never been seen and will never be seen."
"Keep your breath," says Aalbèk Jensen in the newsletter.
Lars von Trier, 58, has recently been known for its media appearances and novelties, such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac, which have raised the number of hearings in recent years.
In the 1990s, he directed the Kingdom Series to the television.
01.09.2014 15:20 The Trade Chain Lidl appears to have received Finnish side, at least if the results are believed.
The turnover of Lidl Finland’s commercial group Lidl, which is operating in Finland, continued to increase during the financial year ending at the end of February.
The company also raised its income.
Profit before taxes amounted to EUR 79.6 million compared to EUR 56.4 million earlier this year.
In turn, turnover increased from EUR 960 million to EUR 1.2 billion.
The increase was 25 per cent.
The company that increased its market shares also improved its operating income from EUR 61 million to EUR 84 million.
The percentage of net sales was 7.1%.
The financial year of German Lidli will last from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company claims to have paid tax to Finland on the financial year ending in February EUR 13.7 million.
The ever-exploited company has told us that it will invest EUR 100 million in Finland this year.
Finland currently has a 142 Lidl store in Finland and employs more than 4,000 employees.
The first stores were opened in 2002.
For the Ice Bucket challenge, please contact your customer and leave their seats at their disposal.
Brittany Roberts shouted so loud when he was poured on ice cold water that he damaged his face's bones.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended badly.
The woman has been taken to the care of after she screamed at Ice Bucket in her performance, so strong that her jaw went out of place.
Isabelle Roberts shouted so loud when he was poured on ice cold water that he damaged the structure of his face.
"The water was so cold that I was just yelling, but I was screaming when I felt my jaw getting stiff", he says to The Jä magazine.
Ice water is poured on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts moment before the accident.
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, my jaw was locked, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sisters took the same note and started laughing, but I had to thank the first aid.
A 20-year-old Brittany who participated in the super-popular challenge on Tuesday was taken to a hospital where the chin was put back in place.
Video recording has become an Internet sensation and has been distributed thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The angle of view of the wolves’ howling (above): How can the growth of fan numbers be explained?
Today was such a great time for you.
This is what the basketball player Sakari Pehkonen said in 1995, when Finland had played in the EM final tournament against France in the Athenian Marouss football hall.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I remember the game when you were there.
They were also about 100 Finns who shouted at 20,000 viewers who were drawing, otherwise empty-out, the noise of the hall.
I wonder what Pehkonen would have said 19 years later after the World Trade fair for the World Cup.
In Bilbao, there are 30 times the troops of a hundred Finnish fans.
The EM games in 1995 were the search time for a Finnish basketball game.
The men swept their way into the final tournament by winning, among other things, the fight against the Russians at the Helsinki Sports House.
Its victory will open doors to Europe's cream.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möllä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann put Möllä on a calcinal line to the final tournament team.
A solution that many disagreed with.
Now I can tell you that Dettmann was far-fetched, even though everything didn't go according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dived down.
In Athens’s competitions, Finns were known to have attended a total of just over 100.
Among them were journalists, gamers' relatives, Finnish basketball trainers and a few fans.
Bilbao also has operators, relatives and trainers, but there are also fans there.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown in imaginable proportions.
I'm sure you can't tell the exact number of Finnish cruises.
The estimates have moved between 7,500 and 10 000.
Whatever the number between here and there, it's an unintelligible number.
Here's an explanation for sports doctors.
In the global global economy, companies in the world economy move across borders.
There is still a chance for sport to see how we are doing internationally.
As mobility increases, we will be able to look at how our daughter and sons are successful in the world, says Professor Hannu Itkonen, of exercise ciology.
There will be Finns in Poland, both in Spain and in the World Cup for Aeroplanes, who apply for experience.
Common experience.
But that's not everything.
In sports, too, there must be attraction in sports.
In the first century, the popular culture of sport will be brought up into the world of sport.
It is a lower threshold to go to sports competitions than to watch the art in Berlin.
The prosperity of the massages is still a failure to get off on the ground.
Let's go back to 1995.
At the time Coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and the players to become professionally involved in top sport.
It took almost 10 years to complete it.
The turn of the direction changed and the national team activity was raised and raised to base.
The aerodrome crew made the same move sooner than before.
Now they both enjoy working together.
As Itkonen says, which species have managed to produce their top sport, where the sacred Trinity functions: sports-media-sponsors.
The public is also interested in it.
And the media has taught us what it is like to support a carnival, Ikonen reminds us of what it is.
Can the football species transfer this massive interest to domestic series as well?
At basketball and volleyball, the average play is for hundreds or just over a thousand viewers.
The East considers the question to be good, and it does not necessarily give an answer that would allow very good species.
One of the schools believes in the interest of changing.
Another is the one who doesn't want to make a sweet stomach full of it.
This group is ready for a live trip to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the domestic series do not care.
There's a challenge for the next person in the middle of the drug.
For Botksa plot confirmation - nearly 1.5 hectares off the lake -
Nastola is awarded by Valtteri Bottaksän, a public transporter, on the beach at home.
The government approved the transfer of a plot of 1.4 hectares at the meeting of the government each Monday.
In the future, free-time housing will be placed on the property.
In Názala, the success of Bottaksa has been monitored since this survey period.
He will be treated as a welcome to the market country of Lahte, Lahti region and Nastala.
The gift house is located in Koiskala, near Kärkjärvi.
It has come under the authority of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the area in which the municipality will land six buildings at a cost by the end of this year.
Bottas reached his fourth prize ball player in the Belgian competition this year.
He's five at Q points.
Bottas is a native nastolian and has lived in the crops of his childhood.
He lives right now in England, but he goes to Nastila every time he's out of shape.
Bottas has visited high schools and youth facilities.

The pilots of Ralph Lauren's intelligence are the field ballworkers, but also the top-notch actor Marcus Giro should do so.
According to her shirt, she helps her to follow her own development and to regulate her recovery.
There are silver sensors in their shirts, from which information is transmitted to the cell phone on the shirt and from there on to the cell phone or tablet computer.
The sensors mean the heart rate, the rhythms of breathing, stress and steps.
The mobile cell operating as a central unit is removed before the shirt is thrown into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not given you any precise time to start selling a shirt or even hinted at its price, Tech Times news.
Raph Lauren is not the only intelligent-oriented company that invests in clothing.
Avian Athos has brought to sale a mindset and an intelligent chorus.
They control heart rate, breathing and muscle work.
The claims cost 100 dollars apiece and the required thumb sized central unit costs two hundred dollars.
Red Orbit has also been written about the specifications.
Smart way to save in books.
The cost of college books in the United States is $1,000 for many students, so soon the new year of study by Matt>>eng<<, who started his second year of study, found a good way to save costs.
He developed a system whereby later year's students quote their books against the nominal remuneration instead of selling the books immediately.
"My book of mathematics would normally have cost $180; I spent the entire semester on the operation of $10 and a batch of sandwiches," says Schroeder, 19-year-old, who studied at Covenant College in the state of Georgia.
Schroeder tells us that his last semester's book would normally have cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the Board of the University, the average student spends over $1 200 a year on books and school supplies, but students have many ways to reduce these costs.
Students increasingly end up using online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's idea.
An increasing number of students hire textbooks so that they can use the book throughout the semester and pay for it clearly less than the students buying the book.
According to Neebo Inc., who sells over 250 books, the rental of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
The statistics on the sector confirm that approximately one quarter of the books of university bookstores last spring were rents, says Trevor Meyer, President of Neebo Enterprise.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from booksellers at the National Association of College Stores.
Here are simple ways to save real money.
Network trades
In online shops, a new book can only be obtained by a third of the price it would pay for the activity in the bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler's 9th edition of the "Calculus" book is nearly 290 dollars, but the book of Chegg.com from the store of the pictograms is 239,99 dollars.
Buy as it is.
The books used are a good alternative if the reader does not interfere with other notes and the appearance of the person who is reading it.
For example, the "Calculus" book receives $93.49 from Chegg.com, which is used for shopping at $93.49.
British Young University's last year student Matt Monday, 25 years old, says he bought a book entitled "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding The Business End Of The Surrendering company" from the Amazon.com store for only $0.42.
The book would have paid $48.
The Director of Amherst's College Without Worlds at the University of Massachusetts, Ingrid Pricey, and other academics, recommend that students ask their professors if they can use the previous editions in the course.
Sometimes the reforms of the new edition are not important for the teaching of people.
In this case, the correct edition can only be found at a fraction of the price that should be paid again.
In addition to bulk and eBay Inc's Half.com, eBay Inc's Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Rental
It is worth considering renting books if you take good care of them, remember to return them, and you do not need them for the course you have completed.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for the entire semester costs about $20.
Please refer to the rules of the leased company, such as notes, the use and use of the accent for subsequent charges.
Renter, beware: if you forget to return the book, the late payment may be higher than the purchase price of the book.
E-books
The issue of obtaining e-books instead of ordinary paper may also arise.
These books will be rented to the holder of the e-book, such as Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc., for example.
From the Chegg store, you will receive the "Calculus" book e-mail for six months at about $61.
Bracey says that many students in literature save the most because several classics can currently be downloaded free of charge, whereas books in science and technology can be very expensive.
It is worth comparing the different sellers to which option they choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon start Pepperdinen in law, recommends using the ISBN number to determine the price, as it will help to ensure that you are looking for the right book.
Before you order from the network, make sure that the book is definitely in storage, says Gaul.
He himself learned through the head of this.
The delivery of the book he bought was four weeks away, and he eventually had to obtain a book at full prices from the university bookstore.

Fires have almost doubled the number of people killed last year compared to last year.
This year, almost twice as many people have died in fires as compared to last year.
According to the media surveillance of the Finnish Civil Protection Agency (Spek), 55 people have already been killed in fires in 49 different fires by now.
At the same time last year, there were 31 fire deaths at the corresponding time.
Most of the dead, 36, have been men.
There have been 11 people over 65 years of age who have been 11 years of age.
According to the statistics on fire deaths of the organisation, the situation was worse last year in 2009, when by the end of August 64 people had died in fires.
The vast majority of fire deaths occur in homes.
17 fire deaths have occurred in the floors, 21 in the home houses and seven in the row and other small houses.
Spec reminds the home of re-establishing fire safety.
At least the performance of all home fire alarms should be ensured according to Spek.
In addition, everyone should check that the initial cleaning equipment is easy to use.
All the premises of the home must also have a free exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they are allowed to use while at home.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff.
The opponents of the NATO Summit protested at Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the city center of Newport to march against NATO.
On Sunday, some 150 people met at the so-called opposite summit in Cardiff.

Young people were rescued by flight from the Blue Mountains of Australia.
Two teenagers were raised to safety after night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia, where they were stuck in the middle of the night.
A 16-year-old girl and 18-year-old man left for the walk after noon on Sunday to Govets Leaf in Blackhead.
The people concerned about young people who had not returned home and called the police at 8:00 p.m.
A search party composed of local police and assistance officers was sent to look for young people, and two were found around 23 o'clock near the British Veil crash.
The girl had hurt her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with a couple, and they were brought to safety Monday morning morning.
The patients were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Foreign soldiers withdrew from Luhanski Airport from Luhanski Airport.
Ukraine's troops have retreated from Luhanski airport.
According to the military, soldiers were given a withdrawal order by the military.
According to the Ukrainians, the parachutists have been vehemently brought together with the Russian tanks in the field.
According to the military representative, the arms fire on the other side has been so specific that the shooter is likely to have Russian professional soldiers.
Over the last 24 hours, seven Ukrainian soldiers have died.
Ukraine’s patrol ship, which had yesterday taken artillery parts off the South-East Sea, sank in the morning, reports the border guard.
Eight Marines have been rescued and two are still missing.
The border guard had no idea where the ship was shot.
The Separatists already told us that they shot the ship last night on social media.
According to the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Russia will not attack Ukraine.
Lavrov, however, insisted that the Ukrainian forces immediately withdraw from positions from which they could not fire civilians.
According to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, an immediate cease-fire without conditions should take place during the Minsk negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the OSCE.
Lavrov also recalled that Russia will be responding to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economies, the social economy, our companies.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions from our partners' actions, Lavrov threatened.
The heavy rains got Malmö and Copenhagen flooded.
The streets were flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen on Sunday, when the heavy rains struck southern Sweden and Denmark.
The floodwaters split several times, mixed traffic and buried cars.
On Sunday, the authorities estimate that it may take a long time to slow down the flood, even if it was forecast that the rain would stop on Monday.
Hard rains were caught by the Swedish authorities and no weather warning was given in advance of the rains.
On-call meteorologist Ari Väela of the Finnish Weather Department estimates that the saderinma that worked in the area was very local.
The rain range seems narrow and on-site.
No wonder it's been hard to predict.
The French Socialists should "be quiet and help France", says the main supporter of Francois Hollande.
Valls strongly called for a split left "to show his feelings" to the socialist president in difficulty, whose composition of the new government did not obtain the approval of the French majority.
The President deserves all respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
"Our job is to stay by her side," Valls said, and deserved to be praised.
As a useful gesture, the Prime Minister calls on the Government to leave France, despite the French controversial 35-hour working week, in spite of a proposal by the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Emmanuel Macron, earlier this week, to talk about the rule.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the socialists to act in agreement with the government.
However, the Minister of Justice, Christiane Taubira, asked for a meeting of socialist citizens who held different opinions at the press and criticised the Socialist Party for allowing it to "to give up the hope of the future".
Marine Le Pen, the director of the National Front of the Ärikeist, mocked the constant mutual gap between the socialists and said that I do not believe that the new government of Valls will last a few months longer than that of the new government of Valls.
Francois Hollande may have gone to war, but so has Mr. Valls, who was obliged to form a new government after the previous one did not last summer.
"and the new government will not last until autumn or winter," Le Pen said to journalists.
He reiterated his party's proposal to decoupling the parliament and considered the election performance of his party in the premature elections, and he himself would be willing to chair the party.
The ruling party in France committed to crushing loss in March's municipal elections and the extreme right held the list of high-end EU elections in May.
According to the opinion of the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday, 76% of the French believe that a socialist party may break up with a number of competing groups before the end of the Dutch period in 2017.
Po University political scientist Pascal Perriné warned that French people would soon lose their patience unless the new social government managed to improve the economy and record-level unemployment.
"There is a small chance of success, but the public should be quick to note that change is taking place," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
Pokka was deceived by the Finland's founders Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkola and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka was badly betrayed in the section of the program that was written down.
The Suomi Programme published last Thursday on the website a fun video of the recordings made on Thursday.
The directors Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahhkola and the meteorologist Pekka Pouta are trying to record the main Finnish advertisement for the next day's broadcast, but the recording is not going to go right to the phone.
Alm-Sira is confused in his words when he tries to speak the word budget line, and his confusion also gets Pouda and Rahkola to go all the way over and over.
And these heroes should be allowed to launch a direct broadcast each and every one of them, says Finland's Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both popular and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pou, 68, who worked at the photo office of the magazine, was the third in a series of potrets in 1972.
Israel's Prime Minister Gold Meir is in the picture.
A meeting of the Socialist International was held in the House of Mayors in May 1971 at the Fredrikin Kaupthing in the House of Mayors.
There were many Heads of State at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven bodyguards went along with him.
However, at the beginning of the meeting, we had plenty of five minutes to photograph.
I took this picture from four five meters away.
The light and background were in place.
I just realized that this time I did it.
The manifestation of the mei shows that the Middle East leaders have had a difficult time before.
At that time, the competition was carried out with photos of known persons or events taken from them.
It is wonderful that today you can also succeed with other images, as long as you have an idea and a visual twist.
This is the second best picture I've taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's rollover image from Munich's Olympics.
I didn't send you to competition.
The argument: Aarnio's investigation has already cost more than EUR 5 million already.
The investigation of the lawfulness of the police’s drug unit has already cost more than EUR 5 million and has required 30 to 50 years of staffing.
This was assessed by Juri Rajamäki Jyväskylä in thesis on information technology for the University of Jyväskylä.
Mr Rajak maintains that the enforcement of law enforcement and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved through the integration of information systems for investigation and judicial processing.
According to Rajamäe, modern technology enables multiple use of crime-related material.
He notes that it is possible to build a system whereby the information collected to determine the crime is automatically sufficient electronic evidence to satisfy the chain of evidence and, at the same time, allows for comprehensive law enforcement.
The statement will be held on Saturday.
Yle: The 1999 idea of vegetable food was forgotten for the school wall: "Fish and chicken dishes are included in the video."
A picture of the special information found on the front of the hill of the high school of Women's Travel created a homepage in the social media, says Yle on her website.
Insect food business!
Fish and chicken dishes from school lunch were grown.
Only when there is meat on the list will we prepare a vegetable option.
This is what the school wall looks like in a forgotten, 15-year-old press release.
You can get a picture from here.
The image that is common in social media has caused people to send a hateful feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
Arja Vaarma, Head of Food and Cleaning Service, tells Yle that the lost note on the wall is not true and should have been deleted a long time ago.
Apparently, before my arrival, there has sometimes been such an idea that has been discussed with health care during my time.
Each student will receive a meal according to their wishes, he will inform Yle.
Today at the school of Pirkkala, students are offered a herbal food option only with the consent of their parents and with a certificate from their doctor or nurse on vegetable diet.
The danger justifies the solution to Yle that young vegetable-food experiments may leave nutrition short and the absence of meat or chicken may cause surprise from the children of the students.
Norwegian Cruise, close to the 3 billion dollar Prestige Cruise agreement, is worth $3 billion.
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise company in the world, is negotiating to purchase its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion.
The Norwegian Cruise company, which has a market value of USD 6.8 billion, would be available to the luxury cruisers and wealthy customers of the Prestige Cruises company against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N) companies which are more competitive in future.
According to the sources, information on a possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not produce results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), a private equity company, also owns 20% of Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not want their names to be made public because negotiations were not held in public.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to any comments and Apollo's representative refused to comment.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, has 13 cruise ships with a route map covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Mediterranean and the Caribbean.
Its turnover grew by 13 per cent from 2012 to 2013, when its turnover amounted to EUR 2.2.7 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates from Miami, sails under the name of the Ocean and Regent brand, comprising a total of eight cruise ships, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was EUR 1.2 billion, which is six per cent more than in the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the rise in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
Companies compete to become the top choice for these new customers when they choose to go on a cruise.
Prestige Cruises will register in the United States stock market the conversion of the first shares in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares since the 2007 trade, which had a value of USD 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was established with its current composition in 2000 as a joint venture with Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a Malaysian billionaire, Lim Kok Thay, a entertainment and casino company.
Apollo invested billions in the Norwegian Cruise Company in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise registered as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting accounted for 28% of the company, Apollo's 20 per cent, and TPG Capital LP's share was 8 per cent from the end of June.
The combined total share of Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise companies is 82% of North America's cruise capacity, as shown in the registration document published at the time of the withdrawal of the shares of Prestige Cruise.
The Government of Tampere will discuss this issue today.
Animalia wishes the government to support the initiative with strong support.
According to Salla Tuomivaara, the Executive Director of Animalia, the University of Tampere, who is preparing a doctoral thesis for the University of Tampere, for the period of dolphins in Finland and around the world, it is necessary to end immediately.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a generalisation of the view that the treatment of advanced mammals such as dolphins in dolphins in dolphins is not animal health or ethically sustainable.
This view would also like to be taken on board with regard to Latvia.
The abolition of the definition is not only a matter of animal rights, but also a question of the imaged tourist destination of Tampere, the Judge-in-Office points out.
According to the jury, the death of Näsi-defin confirms the requirements for the downside of the deliferous activity.
The death of the seen is a sad continuation of the dark world of the Delifaria of the Särkän mule.
It is time to set a point for death, close the dolphins' prison and find out how to move the Tampere dolphins to a limited sea area, a kind of dolphin shelter, the Judgeware demands.
It was not necessary for you to experience the return of dolphins to the original habitat, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Särkänym will be able to experience more life than their unsuspecting concrete, the Judge’s hope is.
The objective of the Animal Health Union Animalia is to ban the use of all wild species in circuses in the overall reform of the animal protection legislation in preparation.
This includes also the specifications.
In support of this claim, the Executive Director of Animalia Tuomivaara will take part in today’s 1.9th demonstration on behalf of dolphins.
In the demonstration at the Japanese Embassy in Helsinki, a demonstration will be adopted against the dolphin hunting season in Japan.
During the hunting period, approximately 2300 dolphins are severely imprisoned or killed annually, either for the use of dolphins or for food purposes.
Putin insists that Kiev open negotiations on the new state with the East.
President Vladimir Putin called on the Ukrainian government to fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and to immediately start negotiations on the "state" of the region, the Russian news sources.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the territory of the eastern Ukraine, controlled by the Separatists, would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine would have to be reconsidered in order to allow the people of the Russian-speaking region to defend their rights and interests.
The commitment made by Putin to the Government of Kiev to negotiate with the Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners is in line with his obvious strategy, which he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help separatists take over the region and thus to force the Ukrainian Government in practice to grant the newly declared Novorosser an independence that will enable it to move to the West instead of the West.
During the interview with the State Channel 1 TV channel, Putin condemned the efforts of the Ukrainian army to regain the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk territory dominated by the separatist separatists, which were occupied by separatists in March and April by Moscow following the Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on 18 March.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently watered the region into "Novorossija", "New Russia" – this term resembles the glory of the revolutions of the Russian power.
According to Itar-Tassi, the Russian news office, Putin, said that the planned peace talks are a "aircraft" as long as Ukrainian politicians are conducting campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government forces are attacking civilians in the separatist areas under separatist rule.
"We must immediately begin extensive negotiations, not only on technical matters, but also on the organisation of society and on the status of the state of the South-Eastern, so taking into account the interests of the people living there," he says.
According to Peskov, Putin's reference to "stateism" is linked to a broader independence, which has been discussed with the Kiev Management for months in its attempt to alert the fears of the Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only the Government of Ukraine can grant the Eastern Territories the independence they need, says Pesk.
This issue cannot be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, says Pesk, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict within Ukraine.
The interim comment of the Kremli representative, which was intended to correct Putin's comments on the 'false interpretation', stressed that the Russian administration is dealing with the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions in a different way from that of the Crimea, where in practice it took over an area where a majority of 2 million people are ethnically ethnically destitute.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect itself with the Donetsk or Luhanski regions in the East, because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region are not ethnically ethnic and because, according to pre-conflict opinions, the majority of the population was in favour of staying in Ukraine.
The independence on which the Russian diplomats have discussed in international fora would allow local governments in Ukraine to agree on their own trade agreements and external relations, which would give the Kremlin, in practice, the power to bring together the Russian Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was linked to Russia five months ago, is located in the main fleet of Russia, as well as the port areas of commercial shipping and historical coastlines.
In the area between Rostov and Crimea, there are also mines, factories and metal insulators that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators – after a new election – seek constitutional amendments in order to strengthen the decision-making powers of regions other than the core region of Ukraine in relation to their own economy and the position of languages.
However, its vision of independence seems to differ strongly from that of the separatists of the Kreml and Moscow, armed and leprosy separatists.
Putin's latest commitment to the Government of Kiev to negotiate with the Russian rebels as equal partners after the rebels went further last week after the Russian tanks and troops invading the formerly peaceful region of the East to the coast of the Azov Sea.
The Ukrainian security authorities fear that taking over the city of Novoazovski, the separatist city of the separatists supported by Russia, will be the beginning of a greater effort aimed at taking over the entire strategic region up to Crimea.
It is the result of a massive civilian and military staff mission to strengthen the city of Mariupol. Mariupol, a half a million inhabitants, is known as a steel-producing port city located between Novoazovsk and the narrow area leading to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, in Brussels, the Presidents of the European Union spoke about further measures to prevent future violations of the Russian Union in Ukraine, the former Republic of the Soviet Union, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We will soon recover a point from which there will be no return," warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in the region of the Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not take decisions on direct action; the leaders proposed further resolutions to enable them to be introduced if the Ukrainian crisis re-emphasises under uncertain circumstances.
Ukraine's soldiers had to withdraw from their position in the Ilovak region after the transfer of two Russian armored forces and 1 000 soldiers last week to Donetsk in order to strengthen the separatists in difficulty, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council, informed journalists on Saturday in Kiev.
