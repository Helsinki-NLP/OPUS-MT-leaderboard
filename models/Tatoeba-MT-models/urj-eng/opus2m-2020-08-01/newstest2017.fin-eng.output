A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco, San Francisco.
The 28-year-old chef, who had recently moved to New Francisco, was found dead in the local shopping centre's stairs this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt him and says, "His affairs were going well at last."
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galica, the San Francisco Bureau of the Death Doctor's Office.
The Police Department of San Francisco said that the death was determined as a spirit crime and that the investigation is ongoing.
The brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told KGO ABC's network in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a liner in Boston, had received his dream job as head of kitchen kitchen at the Sanfranciscolainen Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of Sons & Daughters said that they were "horrified and upset" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works like a close family, and he's gonna miss him very much," he said.
We receive our thoughts and our condolencess to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louisicia said that Frank was at the beginning of the hostels, but that recently "his affairs were going well at last".
"He found the apartment and he dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louisi said that he didn't know anyone who would have tried to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a big heart.
His way of feeling a bond with the family was to make us food, to have dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was the brother who ran the river along with him.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was an unwrought diamond that shined brighter every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on this matter is requested to call the 415-575-44 number of the San Francisco Police Department’s tip line.
Doctors Act: Requirements for new work-related measures to combat labour.
The representatives of medical professionals have asked their trade union to adopt new work-related measures in their dispute about the new agreement.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) invites the whole Council to support the new work struggle measures from the beginning of September.
JKK says that ministers have not been able to cope with concerns about the agreement.
In July, medical practitioners and doctoral students voted to reject the agreement that had been concluded with BMA.
58% of voting members rejected it.
In his letter to the members of the JDC President Ellen McCourt, published on Thursday evening via Twitter, the government had maintained the "self-sufficiently silent" issues which, according to him, led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this respect, the JDC Government has voted to reject the fully proposed new agreement and to demand formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the Government of the JDC has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to obtain authorisation for an early start-up and expanding work fight programme in early September.
It has been the result of the dispute that medical practitioners have participated in six cases this year, including the first complete work stop in the history of the NHS health care system.
The director of BMA medical practitioners, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote had been rejected, the terms recommended by BMA were rejected.
He had told the members of the BMA that the agreement was good and should be approved before 55,000 medical practitioners and students had voted.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be directed to doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: an external interface?
Ele, which ended the crisis.
On Tuesday, the Presidents of Turkey and Turkey held their hands on each other and on the end of the war on words and financial sanctions lasting eight months.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of the palace of St. Petersburg, I received a clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, we did. We did.
But Putin's smile seemed violent, and he didn't threaten the warmth, even his own quiet norms.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdoga was speaking again about his "loved friend" Putin - five times according to a report.
I went crazy in the bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to pre-crisis levels but to even better ones.
The next day's newspapers here described Erdogan as acting like nothing bad ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm was reflected in the opposite.
But the glitter of Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech was the crisis: when Turkey shot down a Russian combat aircraft at the Syrian border.
Moscow's response at that time was frantic.
Putin attacked Ankara on the ground that it stabbed Moscow in the back.
The insult was even worse when it came from an assumed friend.
The reconstruction of true trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to rebuild.
The public opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the government led to an amazing, profound attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seems that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal trade in goods in the Syrian territories ruled by Isis.
He has turned this down hard.
In St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the requested apology from President Erdogan.
War won some sort of victory.
The benefits of agreeing a hard rest are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all his friends after he was deported in the failed coup d'état of last month.
The current attacks in the oceans have also clearly shaken him.
There is already an economic motive.
The economic sanctions in Russia have been severe, in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The figure has fallen by nearly 90 per cent.
In the case of rural areas, local tour operators and charter airlines will certainly be relieved when flights are finally completed.
They wish for a late season's attack on the Mediterranean Sea.
And already this week, the state TV has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables after the re-importation of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed.
"tourists, tomatoes back here," as the Vedemost newspaper's report said.
However, the visit also had a positive added value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West about what is considered a weak response to the attempted coup.
With long-lasting resentment on the evasive front from the forthcoming EU membership negotiations, Puti stands out, who is eager to exploit the cool and to break Turkey's ties to the West.
The President of the Russian Federation must have received points of reference from Ankara where he asked for support from the designated authorities following the revolutionary attempt.
Of course, this is the light of Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the brown sea field enabled the "external association" presented by Russia and Turkey, as one analyst described the situation for me: two countries that experience the abandonment of the West and the wrongness of them, uniting their powers.
However, these two have great differences despite public reconciliation.
The key issue is Syria, where Moscow has recently attracted itself to the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of talk that, after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The President-in-Office deliberately avoided answering the question of their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can look for a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostilities, and given the possibility of a complete disaster in NATO member Turkey when shooting down a war aircraft, it is certainly better that the two leaders are still in a position to speak.
The Bank of Scotland will disappear from non-Scotland customers.
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand is reduced to the back office role.
The Bank of Scotland will disappear from outside Scotland’s customers.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s international objectives.
After the bank hit the bank eight years ago and had to save it, it has abandoned these goals.
The Bank’s policies have been using the RBS brand to protect other consumer finance brands.
It was supported by several pounds used to sponsor international sport, from Six Nations to Wimbledon Master Andy Murhaheh.
But it is now considered right to allow national brands to come to the front of the group.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not start again from the beginning.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, with the exception of headquarters and listings, shall be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already available to customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller, private banking brands with more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a round of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investor brand and employer of our employees, because we are now becoming a much more brand bank."
When the bank became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I'm saying that we no longer have global goals, that we have local goals.
Each of these brands means something very different in its own communities, and our staff works with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue the Six Nations sponsorship and has raised the profile of different brands in its sportsponsors.
"It is now time for us to move towards a brand bank, because basically (we have not asked) it is about how we can concentrate on making this a better bank for our customers," said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on customers' needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettor wins at Newmarket with Predition and makes 3000 profits.
The dettor injects champagne after having won a total of 3000 winnings after a double win.
The racer Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3000th UK profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He won the second victory of the milestone evening at home in his race for John Gosden by coaching the Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey that will bring about this milestone in race.
He's following Sirggets, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Edderry and Willie Carsonia.
The third-time Master Jr. Dettor, who previously won Ghayyar, said, "This is a special one."
I'm very emotional because my family is also here.
I am very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very humble.
The dettor is sucking his own horns when he tells Predilection to show up after the victory.
Two contestants have reached this milestone in the Obstacles - Master jockey Richard Johnson and a 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record of more than 4300 winners in a criminal career.
Lester Piggot, 9-time Derby winner, 4493 payouts.
Frankie is one of the best racers of today’s time, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which only a few have reached before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical dick will tear him away from you in the weighing room.
He's a great native to the competitions, his enthusiasm and his charisma have been pulling fans on the species for years.
Franki told Epsom a few months ago that she would have been riding a 6000 winner if she weren't just the jockey of the weekend and the big competitions.
Seriously, Frankie has been riding the winners in Great Britain for most of the 30 years, which is amazing to see.
He is a lively person who is a good thing for British competition, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori met up from a milestone to a trademark with a cargo landing from a fairytale.
Flying stop-downs for a long time, Frankie Dettor has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a mountain track.
A lot of profits in large competitions, including his famous 'Magnifcent Seven' victory in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and suffered from a competitive ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he was having a hard time coming back after six months of non-competition, but he showed a significant degree of character strength in challenging suspects and returning in good condition.
And he may still be going on longer - Dettor has said before that he would like to continue competing for at least 50 years of age.
Russia's Putin Selection of the Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanovin Sergei Ivanovin
President Vladimir Putin has suddenly been disfellowshiped by Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old is now appointed as Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
The Kremli opinion stated that Putin "has ordered Ivanov to move away from the duties of the Presidential Director of the Russian Government", but there was no reason for this.
Ivanov's Deputy Director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
The persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in 2012 in Tallinn, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's protocol and government staff, referred to as the Kremli website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main role of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the draft laws and the management of the implementation of your guidelines.
Putin told the new TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked for access to the place to come true and recommended that Iano be appointed as his replacement.
Are you sure you're okay with that?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served as a Soviet security service in the KGB.
As head of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a public television meeting with President Putin, the two men claimed that the chief of staff resigned on their behalf.
However, despite the smile on the cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, especially just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this just the last of some kind of power struggle?
He doesn't know yet.
However, the argument that the man who was once advertised as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy has been accepted with real suspicion.
In his comments quoted on the Kremlin website to Putin, Ivanov said, "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me this very complex task, I might even say, for four years in charge of this very complex job.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov approved the mission in December 2011.
Formerly acting as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service of the KGB, as well as Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was in charge of the civil service service in FSB, which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his Vice-President.
When Putin came to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted the most.
Once, it was thought that Ivanov could become the Russian President after the second period of President Puti, since Puti’s third period would have been against the Constitution.
However, this task went to another close ally of Putin, Dmitri Medvedevi, Dmitri Medvede.
Putin became prime minister before he returned to President only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds Star, Gibson, was hit after he hit the producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical dispute last month at the destination of the series in Los Angeles.
Serial producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his resignation in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Mr Gibson, presented an apology on Thursday before his resignation was announced.
There were creative differences and disputes in his asylum.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from a series of FBI agents will be later on.
The 54-year-old who had previously stared Dharma & Greg has been part of a series since its first period in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it all I can for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a report published this Friday.
I was hoping to be with you all the time, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our incredible task force, and above all the best fans that a series of fans can have.
The beginning of the 12th production period of the series is planned for the 28th of September.
The mystery fish ended up in the garden in Banff.
The man in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have formed in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that there could be 75 fish in the winds that have been left behind by the water cycle.
Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published the data on the revelation in Periscope, hoping that someone could explain the appearance of two inches of fish.
#FFerry Crossing transit: Bridge now extends to Fifeen.
By May 2017, the 1.35 billion pound project is expected to be completed by 1.55 billion pm.
Engineers have joined the north of the transit site of Queensferry, along with the land bridge, which means that the bridge now extends to Fife.
It is the first of the four brackets between the "cassettes" that are now preparing for each of the three pillars of the bridge.
Siltaus Fifesta is now 600 metres long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
There are 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 bristles.
The 1,35 mr. pound project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Prime Minister Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to be in the middle of a retreat from the country to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the transit site of Queensferry.
We are all witnessing a truly impressive engineering work in this project, which has used more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel alone to build this section of bridge."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the bridge between the land bridge and the bridge bridge bridge is a demanding operation where the utmost precise dimensions need to be agreed upon.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last part of the deck's concrete sheet lies today in Rosyth, which means that the whole deck is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructions project, said: "The first lock in any bridge project is always an important milestone of the milestone.
In this fantastic project, this lock represents the tip of the construction technology.
After the last part of the road had been installed and combined with an enlarged North-Western education, we had to close the remaining part of the north, i.e. the inland Republic, after that.
This was done by pulling the north route from the land bridge 700 mm southwards.
This was a huge and at the same time a very demanding measure.
Huge, since the ground bridge is 222 metres long, weighs about 6000 tonnes and has to be pulled around 3% in the slope.
It is demanding that the permissible deviations according to which the team was working were small, only a few millimetres each way.
I'm sorry, but it was okay.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky while alive"
The three men are "happy alive" after they fell off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNI rescue boat was alarmed at 1:20 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event developing in the Moelfre Bay.
Those who deliberately tried to swim in safety while their boats continued to move forward for themselves.
"We saw the boat coming closer to men and imagined the worst," said Vice Jones, the Grand Master of Moelfre's lifeboat.
Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we got moving," he added.
The local fishing boat hit two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging out of a boat without life vests.
The men were taken to a rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
said, "These three men who are caught in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a tap-toe line on it, but it had somehow removed the boat from the time the boat crashed.
Someone will take care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is an effective hunting of health and happiness.
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Over the past decade, many people have expressed concern that teenagers and children are no longer going out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time looking at evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and take part in some of the activities.
The show time was initially limited to television, then video games, and now recently to cell phones.
So it is wonderful to see that technology and outdoor air activity do not differ.
I refer, of course, to a wildness called Pokémon Go. Application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later born in the drawing series, cards and other additional products).
Like many pop culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
The release of the game in other countries then delayed, since the popularity of overloaded servers was enormous.
The only days in which Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as the Tinder.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nutshell, players use their mobile phones to search for Pokémon, who are traced using GPS, and who can be "photo" after being found (with the help of a phone's handkerchief) or "chapter" (with the help of a phone's handkerchief).
The generation that played the game younger has joined wildness and jumped off the couch to search.
In the United States, the game has been marked by a significant increase in the daily steps of the "centralist".
The Apple Watch app, followed by 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the publication of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% of the users following the Cardogram.
Who doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Gota, it just sees the level of training.
Many public health campaigns have not produced any results because the majority of public health warnings are boring and conveyed by people who appear to be unhappy.
However, the importance of sport cannot be ignored.
There is a higher risk of being infected with cancer or depression if you are not properly mobile.
The ability to help with weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, its benefits being too diverse for the purposes of this list.
The fineness of Pokémon Go is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
Three pillars of health will be covered: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
People even get to hunt for new new ones.
As a general rule, an abominable blasphemy is looking for these things that you're complaining about.
Yes, someone can walk towards the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although previously there were applications like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game did.
The freshness is lost and the use of the gravitational vibrate is slowing down during its time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, there will be other games that combine applications and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunters to be more active, better well and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in the variety of women's gymnastics.
Pressure pressure.
A public hearing is open to public consultation.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Energistic hypnotics.
I'm soaked in the moustache.
I can't believe it.
It's excellent everywhere.
And now, in the end, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast reached the diversity championship on Thursday, leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic Lights.
He's total score, 62.198, was clearly better than Aly Raisman and Aly Taefina, a teammate for silver medals and "Final Five".
US Simone Biles in balance at the final of the women's telecommunications diversity individuals in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
The party became the fourth American woman who has consistently won the Master of Diversity and, overall, the fifth American, and at the same time strengthened her reputation as her generation, and, of course, of all times, as the best.
He burst into tears when his final score was announced, and his long distance towards this moment ended.
This achievement brings him to the same level with the best athletes of his generation, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised his range to a new level:
The Biles has dominated the last three years of the round, winning 15 World Championship medals, including 10 gold, with programmes whose ambition and precision mix has been so amazing that the Olympics Mary Lou Retton of 19 A.D. called him "the best I see as a gymnastics".
The last test was in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between him and the burden of excessive expectations.
Returning to home in Rio without a handful of gold medals would have been disappointing.
The United States Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman hugs after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the finals of the diversity of women's telecommunications between individuals in the summer Olympics in Brazil in summer 2016 in Rio de Jul on Thursday, August.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday, when he served as a highlight for the start-up of a retirement national team coordinator, Martha Karoly.
Although Biles claimed that he would never be a future in the long run to the top of the road, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permantoe program - the one that includes the volition of his trademark - is adapted to Latin American music, which would also be an excellent match for the street next to the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted as a date by her grandparents, whom Coach Aimee Boorman's mother found while the girl was traveling to the gym where Boorman trained, has become a power factor.
She hasn't lost in the multi-formation since summer 2013, and this profit line will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although the joint was in a small chain after two rounds, it was just a delusion.
The Balanced Party and the Periphery, where Biles is the dominant world world leader, were waiting.
He hit the top at the boom point of 15.433 and crossed them to get 15.93 per diem.
Raisman held him well when they were waiting for the end points - just the truth - and the tears rose to the eyes of Biles’ glittery, white and blue, when the dream of which he once wrote his copy came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of renaissance four years ago when he was divided in the third place, but lost the bronze to the Cakefian in the newest place.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, called "mother" by the Americans, was clearly in charge.
He sent airmen to the public after his permanent performance, after a emotional loss of emotion, a return which at times seemed questionable.
With regard to Biles, this widespread T-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-Wi-W
Officer: Three victims of suicide were shot while they were watching music in the car.
Two women and a 12-year-old girl, who died in the most fatal assault of the first murder in Phoenix during the last decade, were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, as reported in the police release on Thursday.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the 12th of June on the road to a car parked on the parking lot.
The report reports that the shooter, standing on the passenger side of the car, fired the hand up to eight times and then fled on another vehicle.
According to the police, the triple death does not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the purses or another adult victim's $2,900.
Officer of the police in Phoenix, Sergeant EPS said that the shooting led the scientists to examine whether it had been linked to four attacks.
All seven people have died and two have been wounded in the nine attacks that took place during the four months that have taken place mainly in the Latin American part of the city.
"These are happening in the residential area in front of the home," said the CBS subsidiary to KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, such as the brown Nissania in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s and the White Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are related and are done by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, in case of injuries, went to a hospital where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Elise's daughter, Maleah, die at the scene of the accident.
The witness told the police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting of an open van, which was also believed to have been a serial killer's job only half an hour before the triple death.
The researchers found bullet casings, bullet seats and bullet fragments in the engine space.
Mother of a six-year-old with MD: "Your business will be easier".
Edmund Piccito, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund is small-handed, this is the result of a genetic disorder from which his mother, Elizabeth Picciu, did not know when he was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise you anything like this.
Which is not true, of course I did," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn how to identify them and that he may not even survive.
Doctors even suggested that he be placed in hospital care.
"The first reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Piccito explained.
Edmund's foot with a walkie-talkie.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl like he was only three years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he is slowly creating a few milestones in the milestones of the milestones.
He walks naked and rides a bicycle.
Besides, he loves to play with two of his brothers and sings.
Elizabeth shows how the sign of the sign with which Edmund came up with the sign "sing me a song."
"We teach him sign language," Picciút told CBS News.
But this is not an ordinary sign language - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own signs.
It may be due to a number of different causes: genetics, such as in the case of Edmund, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as cancer or Zika virus.
The symptoms and forecast may vary greatly.
It is too soon to say how this affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciu will remember the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going to happen?
She doesn't really know.
In fact, I haven't actually asked for a forecast in a long time, because I don't expect anyone to actually be able to give me one.
But Picciuu has a hopeful advice for mothers who have babies with birth defects due to Zika.
It's going to make things easier.
You can believe the situation will get easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
The loads and floods caused rescue operations in the Mississippi, Louisiana, Mississippi.
The massive rainfall and the widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to report an emergency on Friday, and the state was expected to have more rain on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that many rivers in South-East Louisiana and the Southern Mississippi are flooding over their asses and causing a large flood due to extreme rainfall.
The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that the state authorities are in constant contact with the local authorities, and that assistance is already coming to the regions that need it.
Mr Mike Steele, representative of the Governor's Security and Emergency Emergency Agency, said that they would receive requests from exhaust vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that there were tens of thousands of sandbags in the same district alone.
At the very least, the flooder is valid until the very end of most of the south of Louisiana.
In the opinion, the air traffic services said that the area is expected to have another three to five cents of rain in the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday, as the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River, which flows near Baton Rouge and the Amite River, which flows near Denham Springs, are both located in Louisiana, and are expected to set a flood peak record during the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could enter several houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat is the flooding of the Ascension County along the river, when the flooding rivers fall into Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the state border of Mississippi in Liverpool, South of the south of the state border, was at 9 a.m. on Friday morning at the highest level of all time.
Saviors are still picking people out of flood water in the Districts of Ami and Tekkinson in the southwest Missis.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and sons were on Friday near the Gloster among the saved.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the water of the Beaver Creek, which is located at a distance of over 400 feet from his house, has been rising rapidly during the night.
He says that the other neighbor nearest to him warned him.
"Awake up, and the water just kept rising," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
Hansford's wife told her again that she has not seen the stream of water so high in the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family have all injuries, and that he is the only swimming skill.
Hansford said that those who saved the life hit the trio in a big, army-style truck and took them to Gloster's firehouse, where the rescuers stayed at the night on June.
Krautmann says that the floods "slow quickly to a large extent" in the run-up of the heavy-duty roads, and that the authorities are planning an asylum order.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports 13,75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the country had been completely satisfied with the heavy rain since Wednesday.
The heavy rain and the flooding of streets led to the rescue of the inhabitants of Tangibad County from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five schools, they told me.
WWL, the CBS subsidiary, reported that a member of the Board of Governors at Tangibad said 200 homes had been caught by the flood.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are now under flood.
The president of the region, Robby Miller, said that the authorities were responsible for 72 people and 7 pets, who had remained islanded in the tide water.
In the cities of Misien and Hammond, shelters have been opened for those who have been evacuated.
"They get to come back to their homes when the water comes down," he said.
In the town of Hammond, in the Gout district, a couple of streets were closed due to rising water, and residents were allowed to pick up sand bags to try to keep water out of their homes and movements.
"The latest major flood here was in March," said Lacy Landrum, the City Administration.
This is going to be a similar case.
In Paris, Rupert Lacy, the emergency president of the Harrison County Region, said that the steady rain was on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were reported to have been flooded, but until Friday no flood cases have been reported.
Keith Townson, director of the Opera Value Foods movement located in the region, has lived in the region for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before", Townson said, "and the rain is still going on."
The six-year-old Mahaj Brown has been "full of bullets" for six years to learn about the shooting of Philadelphia.
The police are telling us that a six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old in town this week.
Parents of a child told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Yok.
Parents say that Brown had multiple gunshot wounds, including to the joint, leg, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," the boy's grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy’s condition has been recorded as critical and has been subjected to several surgeries.
The family will tell the station that he is expected to recover.
She was beginning her first class at a local undergraduate school.
The show was one of four subjects in the Germantown Quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-olds.
One-year-old men were reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car with one critical 29-year-old, the status report.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether or not one of the injured men could be the shooter.
The researchers will tell CBS Philadelphia that it appears that there was a marked presence between the shooters.
The type of offensive shells, derived from different attack weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was an absolute battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the sidewalk.
"It seems, therefore, that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in an active battle," said Anthony Ginaldi, Chief of Police of Philadelphia, to the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
The arrests have not been made and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance tapes.
The second six-year-old, girl, got a misguided hand on Tuesday while she was playing in front of her home in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
I hereby invite this year's Olympic Women's Gymnastics team to join me for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympic since 19th, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And so far: This team has three gymnastics, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, which is being banished by Aly Raisma and the Catholic Madison Kocia, will make everything proud.
This team seems, each and every one of us, to America.
It has also established itself at the top of the species of black and Latin American women's presence.
For the past four years, the most successful female camper has been African-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were the first and second.
This is awesome.
In the recent Olympics Gabby Douglas surprised the Olympic winner, and America cheered up.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernández, in which they present unexpected but masterly gymnastics programs.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman who has consecutively won the individual cult in women's diversity.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the world, but the situation does not look like this in gymnasts around the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all along the same path as Aly and Madison when they arrived at the Olympic Team.
They are "Final Five" (last five) because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is a very expensive option, and gymnastics generally practises in private gymnastics modules managed by parents who pay for training, facilities, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (teachers and their gymnastics and families) and the list will follow.
Most of these gymnastic cycles are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the species.
At these clubs, gymnasts get all their training, and this is a costly and long-term commitment to the gymnast families.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles coach, and Haney, Larie Hernández coach, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We should bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities where the numerous young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have offered express and affordable gymnastics to more than 15,000 young people in Harlem (mainly black and Latin) and have trained national and international masters.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) in order to provide high-quality gymnastics for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
The contestants will develop the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body, as well as the intensity, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination provides life-long benefits for good health and for school and work success.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls start gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sport is so important, especially for girls.
We're having an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympics team and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to begin on the road towards healthy, strong and successful young women.
Medical practitioners will arrange new strikes to be organised by doctors after they have rejected the proposal from Jersey Hunt.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association staff, but 58% of 37 000 medical practitioners who voted for the vote rejected it.
In July Hunt revealed plans to enforce the agreement, meaning that NH was "in the unknown soil", and that a number of further delays are damaging staff and patients.
The following medical practitioners will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during difficult hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee of medical practitioners at BMA last night, said in the opinion: "Doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, in particular that it stimulates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors fairly."
As long as the first group of doctors is only eight weeks left for the new agreement, progress must be made and the time is running out.
BMA’s attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have encountered the government’s willingness to participate and occasionally deep silence on the side of the government.
Despite all these promises made by Hunt last month, his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not do so, doctors trainees will be ready to continue working on the fight.
At the end of April, the most recent strike meant a delay of nearly 13,000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception periods, when nurses and consultants were recruited to act as a substitute for doctors on strike guard.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with the employees of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 55,000 medical practitioners who are subject to the contract.
Daniel Multimer, the Executive Director of the NHS Employers Employers, called on medical practitioners so that they did not quit.
Multimer said: "Work struggles are very few or nothing, but they put pressure on the teams and services already in a demanding situation, and they cause concern, anxiety and disturbances for patients, carers and their families."
In the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, positively responded to their concerns regarding the role of control (Gurdian Role) and the announcements (Whistleblowing).
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, further education for those returning from the Sabbath, training costs, mutual recognition of the programme, leave and pay gaps between men in the medicine - has shown how seriously the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A two-pound daily drug may reduce the risk of a heart attack.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are at best two pounds per day of the paying drug after they recommended that it be given longer to humans.
The anticoagulant medicine, tiagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or second seizure.
NHS administrator NCE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now NCE, the NHS administrator, has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Some 140,000 people are having a heart attack every year in England, and one quarter of them are having another seizure or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are the result of a fat material accumulated at the heart of the artery, which forms a destabilisation.
If the collapse breaks, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the heart of the bloodstream, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks off, it can carry blood and break the blood circulation to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at an increased risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, a company of the United Kingdom, which is known as Brilique, reduces this risk by making it less likely that the coagulation will be done.
In today’s NICE draft guidelines, it is recommended that humans be given 90 mg ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg aspirin twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, head of the NICE Health Technology Centre, said: "In spite of the availability of effective prevention treatments, even a quarter of people who have had a heart attack later receive another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often devastating."
The fear of creation can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person.
The evidence shows that it is effective to calculate the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack together with aspirin.
When we initially recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to add available choices to several thousand people who may benefit from them.
Given that data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly as regards the risk of bleeding - are limited over a period of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend longer treatment than during this period.
The protection of political correctness allows for the flourishing of the ground in Muslim regions to flourish in Muslim territories.
The former Mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was devolved last year due to corruption, giving impetus to the report of the government.
The culture of political correctness has led to the fact that the widespread vote fraud in Muslim communities has been ignored, the report of the government that is going on today is being revealed.
Former Minister of State Sir Eric Pickles is setting up police, election officers and city councils to ignore the evidence of the election because of "extremeness of race and religion".
The former Secretary of the Community, the new emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up a guard chain to protect voters who are afraid of voting outside the polls.
He recommends that voters should submit an identity card in their vote to prove who they are.
Today, the voter just needs to say his name and address.
The report also suggests that the finger of the voting person should be placed on the infinite ink so that no one can vote twice.
Publicity should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access for the press to the documents and decisions of the Board of Governors that have been taken by the informal committees or working parties.
"This would not only protect the community, but would protect the local government from a wider culture of corruption and economic fraud, which goes hand in hand with the farm," he said.
The Board commissioned a report following the vote on the Tower Hamlets of Eastern London.
Last year the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be suspended as a result of numerous charges of corruption and illegal acts.
The Court noted that Rahman's "quitely distorted" Muslim community's religious feelings and the accusations of his critics about racism andtired Islam.
Rahman says "sponsored his electoral campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were reasonable or the result of the vote of the individual on each other.
Sir Eric said that proof of fraud was found all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the public administration post in the vote where members of the Muslim community were said to have put pressure on people to vote for their choice of candidate.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on the cleaning of the voting system, including the identity card.
He says in his report: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote, in the opinion of the elders, especially in those communities that have a Pakistani or a Thai background.
"There was concern that...the state institutions had ignored this behaviour because of the "seriously correct" race and hypersensitivity to religion."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean the system, including the refusal of political activists to deal with post-post voting tickets, so that the "gathering" of votes would end.
The report reviewed by Theresa May also calls for stronger amendments to be made to registrations in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for the identification of voters before voting.
Use the finger of the person voting for the infinite ink so that no one can vote twice.
Make systematic adjustments to the nationality in order to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a limit of three years for requests for automatic mail voting.
Avoid political activists from dealing with ready-to-read voice and envelopes from the post in which the voices are sent.
Let the police set up a security chain around the places of asylum.
Other laws that make it easier to blame people for their panging under the Act of Representation of the People Act of 1983.
Make the photograph illegal at the polls.
You demand that only English be used for the purposes of the polling exercise (except in the United States).
Be sure to ensure that staff comply with the rule that the voter must go to jail alone.
Sir ~ the forces in Great London say it's "excellent" that no criminal charges have been brought up after the case of the Tower Hamlets.
"The election will remain with Lutfur Rahman and his official as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegality," he said.
On the basis of several grounds, he was found guilty of no doubt, based on evidence of criminal proceedings.
He also criticized the ineffective "cross to the square" checks at the polling offices of the councils.
Sir Eric said, "Last year's ruling on Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious legacy as the guardian of parliaments, but this worrying and mysterious spread of land and the denial of the facts of certain groups threatens this good reputation."
Crazy Kate's cyclist double-sharp and other celebrity-expected images at the Olympic Olympics in Rian.
This year's fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone from Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, a French cyclist, who has been proven to be the most active creature of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But a 24-year-old Olympics member is certainly not the only gold-trucking athlete this summer who can brag about his own famous daughter-in-law - at least according to social media.
For the sake of the Rio competitions and all the famous faces on our screen at the moment, the FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who appear to be clearly famous in Hollywood.
Hunter and wolf: United States Men’s Fleet Team member Brady Ellison, Left, is a Lingu Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child.
In addition to Kate's double life on the bicycle track, many people online have been quick to see how a certain bowman could be the star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Member of the U.S. Fleet Team, Brady Ellison, has caused a storm on the ground since the surface was raised in his pictures, where he seems to be intimidatingly the same as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And, in fact, to be aware of the passion for social media, the archer admitted that he has heard from a child that he seems to be Le.
"I don't see any great odds, except maybe about the beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly emerge again this year: an amazing similarity between British short jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The largest Russian gymnast Alya Mustafina, with a clear sight, has been said to be a Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan's twin creature.
In Yalta, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burghi has for many years been at the Glee Star of Matthew Morrison for several years.
Larger gear for the eye: This user thinks that Nathan is the Inception actor's "sport version".
A further long-term comparison has been between Pastor Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have the same strong brows and lips.
Russian silver medalr Yulia Efimova has more than just the same actor Annalynne McCord as tanned skin and blonde hair, while the United States team Nathan Adrian is reminded by fans of "The sports version of Josh Gordon Levitt".
Hard ladies: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actor Jennifer Carpenter, right, share the same face shape and eyes.
Not only: one user was very pleased that others also saw similarities.
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a difference between a pair's similarity.
One Twitter user recently found on the site his happiness that "other people on the Internet think that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the star of the United States and the actor of Dexter really have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical to the song of Laura Linene, and the most beautiful winning gymnast of Gabby Douglas, whose own, beautiful wide smile matches the bike It On star to the smile of the Union.
The CBC's Olympic Commentator apologizes for the Chinese swimmer's "dead as a pig" after his apology.
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth instead of women's 4x200-metre-free swim message sent out the CBC's direct Olympic broadcasts on Wednesday.
The Canadian media company CBC has had to apologize after one of its commentators said, during the race, that a 14-year-old Chinese pantyhose "damaged like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig" from a 14-year-old Chinese pantyhose.
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was off when he began to share some of his own opinions at the women's 4x200-metre free swim message final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC reporting groups to bring in "color", was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old from China hit me, baby.
Too enthusiastic, lost as if it smelled bad, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese suomi Ai Yanhan, 14, swims in the second part of the message 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the chance to catch up with China.
The viewers from all over Canada react quickly after being shocked by the language used and its voice.
Emmett Mafarlane said, "Did CBC's reporter just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "dead as a pig"?
The idiot didn't realize he was still on live."
China's Ai Yanhan was filmed in the women's free zone 4 x 200 metres message final as follows: "That little 14-year-old from China was bludgeoned, baby."
The review of Byron MacDonald against Twitter was tough and fast, and many would challenge him.
Users of Twitter did not hold themselves to hear how indifferent Byron MacDonald was to them.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist crowd.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who presided over CBC's transmission, apologized for MacDonald's comment on the live broadcast, saying, "We recommend that a comment on the swimming plan has been sent.
It was a unfortunate choice of words, and we regret that this happened."
The CBC decided to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Scott Russel and his fellow reporter had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and joined an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and issued an opinion.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent directly.
Yesterday, we quickly took action and asked our viewers and followers in social media for direct transmission.
For the sake of clarity, it must be concluded that Byron's comments relate to the bathing performance, not to the person himself, but to the performance of the swim.
However, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized for the direct transmission and tried to specify his comment by saying that he did not mean to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the media with the ladies," he said at the CBC Olympic Mission.
"I was referring to the performance of the swim, not to myself."
"It seems unfair to say that I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was stunned by a woman who arrogantly made up her underwear in the middle of the trade.
Customers didn't know what to look at when a woman was taken off in the middle of Primark's movement to watch underpants.
Things were not better than the fact that after assessing how she looked in her pants, she pulled them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and finally arranged for four pair of panties in a store that was located at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Flekestee.
Primark’s move to Bouveree Place’s shopping centre in Folkestö, where she made up her underwear and then put them back in the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children who had been in the store at the same time said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, "Man didn't believe in his face."
The woman stood in the middle of the trade floor, took the underwear on the pair, took off her own socks and underwear and put on her to make a living.
"He's not even trying to find an outlying place for the arrangement, he just stood there in the face of shame."
"They were all staring, while he was wearing his underwear, and he certainly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for another three pair before he finally decided that he didn't like anything he saw, got back on his feet and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care about who was watching or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he made."
Davidson, a 33-year-old resident in Kent, said: "It is disgusting to think that someone is taking home underwear that someone else has tried but not cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I told him that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothes from the sale of a woman after she left, which is fine."
"It would be a shame to go home with new underwear and see that the other woman has dressed them on and removed them, and they have not been washed."
Primark's representative said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place at Folkeston's movement on Tuesday, 9 August.
All these products have been removed from sales."
This is how you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga.
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little better for you.
We talked to the headmaster of the Krav Mag Federation, Rhon Mizrach, in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-shaping shooters in close proximity.
Whether you were sent for or guaranteed, this video shows how you can pay the attacker at the same rate.
According to Mizrachi, if you're coming after him, the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attackers and "blow the line of fire."
Then you catch the gun between the elbow and the shoulder before you hit the adversary in your face with your free elbow.
Continue with the knee to the joint, and when the assailant goes in pain, turn the gun off his hands, hit him in the face with a gun on his face, and hold the gun on to him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is the same: take your body off the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the offender can't fire it.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and hit the enemy in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back off and stick him with the gun.
Does that sound like a problem?
Watching Mizrachi do this exactly how he does it.
But remember, if you are not the Grand Governor of Krav Maga, the safest way out of the robbery is to give up your money.
Tourist Ian Wright licks Europe's narrowest places for a travel guide.
A British traveler has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most elusive places.
Suffolk’s director and mobile writer Ian Wright, 51, licked the euro banknote, the envy of Piccadilly Circus, the humidifier of the train’s toilet, and sent a public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a photographer to show himself and us where he was going.
However, the experiment made by a film named After Internal Power produced surprising results.
The idea of licking a train used by thousands of people may seem quite unpopular, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
On the way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about the enhancement of intestinal bacteria and about his own health.
Fortunately, none of his licks left him any other bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as the tester of endurance of his intestines in his journey around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This public service task of railway stations in the toilet seat was indeed tested for his immune system.
In the movie he made, he said: "From the time I was a kid, I've been pretty worried about my health, and I've been putting in my mouth all kinds of things from the soil, worms and dirty water."
He really created his reputation during the film.
The very thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
On his display, he had more than 4000 units in photometry.
For the purpose of comparison, the number of hands of counter-pests should be less than 60.
But in a public toilet, he refused to lick when the photometer was shown to be more than 4000 units, and the result is less than 60 of the hands of the censorship.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, after internal strength, together with a Finnish dairy, Valion. The film shows a temperature in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is the worst thing I've ever smelled on the toilet."
There's nothing more serious than that.
I'm not going to lick anything, because it's nighty here.
After the inner force, a Finnish dairy, Valion, was produced together with a Finnish dairy.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
The leader of the selection of snacks, juice and new items, Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at and which, at the same time, would explain the interests of probiotics.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas into the air, and we ended up with the idea of 'call Ian'."
They claim that the interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: tell us about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, about the meaning of intestinal health and about its connection to the immune system.
An increasing interest in bowel health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary allows us to tell consumers more interestingly.
I think the document also shows that we have a good sense of humor.
The card director Tom Hakala added: "Let's say this now: if Ian had kissed some of the things I asked for, like the owl in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the things that I said were easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows saved."
In the course of the election in 2015, 84% of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria specifically with the well-being of the stomach and intestine, and 58% said that they at least sometimes use products with the addition of lactic bacteria.
The blind family destroyed the rental house in the Saltash of Cornwall, before the eviction.
The blind family caused the damage of GBP 50 000 to their rent after they were deported for the terrorist attack on their neighbours.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Rebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwall Saltash after they had been complained several times.
Once they had been removed by force from the property, the upset housing company employees found the property to be in bad condition.
There had been exhausting holes in the walls, floor boards had been torn, waste had been spread to the floor and walls were covered with graffiti.
The family has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the owner of Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said, "This has been a real nightmare for the people, and I don't think I should live this way.
There is much to consider here, because this property is likely to be known through less comfortable groups at Cornwall.
This environment is poor, and their name is bad."
The county had three boys living in a real estate, and according to the police, the violence of the family involved a street fight in the baseball world, the intimidation of people close to it, drug use, drug sales, and public yelling, fighting and cursing.
A 47-year-old Skkeldon, whose name was a lease, received in June a decision on non-social behaviour.
Old waste was found in many of the rooms of the house under the drain.
The property from which drugs have been transmitted by hand, the floor boards had been pulled up.
The neighbors said that the family was seen fighting on the street and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing forced the property of a woman and this partner this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to change voluntarily.
The reformed neighbors thanked me for saying that their lives had become one of them.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and things have always been good.
We've seen the police around here an incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it.
I love it, now that they're finally gone."
Adam Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood, said that the family did not cooperate with the local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often called to the property.
The trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own conduct and for the conduct of his or her family, as this decision is always the last way Cornwall Housing would have done it.
This was a very difficult case, because the conduct was extreme, and their actions were certainly atrocious to their neighbors.
I appreciate everything I have done to my team, to the police of Devon and Cornwall and to the brave members of the community that informed us about us.
I hope that this development will bring some comfort to our neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the property at different times, but they were all in the twenties.
A dirty pillow left on the floor of one bedroom after the wedding.
The housing company's employees now have to clean up the waste dumps around the house.
In 2014, the police made a raid on the property and found more than 70 g of hemp as well as vases, supplies and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skkeldon was fined for the treatment of category B drugs for which he was charged, as a means to continue to handle them.
He claimed that the money was meant for his son Lee Skkeldon’s tombstone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her partners live homeless after staying in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Several walls in the house had been covered with graffiti.
They say that they are trying to desolate residents who keep the rules of their blasphemy leases.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall's police department said that the decision was a clear warning to other tenants who would continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is free of consequences, and to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate crime and antisocial behaviour. The police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified when a jet jet flew down the beach in lowlands.
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal, suffered the shock of their lives.
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft would have passed really low.
Air force said that it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
At the moment, terrible tourists began to panic when a low-fly jet was wiped over a full beach.
The dramatic recording shows how a military aircraft came to an almost contact distance from the sun - worshipers on a sandy line in Aveiro, North Portugal.
The breakers stood up when they understood that they were concerned about the noise from the jet, even though they did not see at first which clouds were coming for them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the numerous holidaymakers who created videos of a dramatic pass in the social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It passed really low, and one point seemed to be running to the ground."
Nuno Arrogja added: "I was surfing and I really felt like the plane was falling on me."
Tourists along the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly low.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight designed to identify fishing vessels close to the coast and had to land so low that it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown considerably lower than usual due to the poor visibility of the smoke from nearby fields, but the Air Force assured us that all safety was not in danger.
Earth fires have destroyed parts of the mainland Portugal this summer, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to the adverse conditions of visibility, smoke from the ground areas and thick fog.
The aircraft was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The result of the first half of the first half of the year was better than expected.
South Karelian social and health (Exote) work in January - June EUR 3.4 million for a better than planned outcome.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to decommission the facility.
The health guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, Exote will try to shorten the lines of action.
The deficit will cover the deficit previously created by the surplus.
The residual amount is used to attract queues and to buy measures for patients.
The year-on-year result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Jewish government will discuss the six-monthly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
Seventy-seven special border tributaries swore a military whale in Immala.
70 members of the Border and Marine Guard School took an oath to the military on Friday.
A military event of the armed forces of the Border and Sea Guard School was held in Immolla on Friday.
The 10th special border roller course swearing event was held in the security sports field.
A military force swears 70 backups.
Cross-border teams are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They will pay 347 days.
This year, a special border manager applied for 310 young people.
They were invited to the selection tests in 250.
Immmala has been trained as a team of challenges since 2007 in Immala.
At the event, the Veteran meeting was attended by five veterans of the boundaries of the five seasons of the season.
The average age of those who are included is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans taking part in the event were born in 1918.
Crime intelligence helps to investigate crimes and expose serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland’s 11 police authorities has been a unit for RTA or criminal intelligence and analysis.
The operation of the unit is outward viewless.
The Hämee Police Department comprises a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's drawn by a Sergeant Sergeant in the Bay.
The chairman of the discharges board is the Lieutenant in Lahti, Finland.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to the IT service in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone works in a dormitory.
The unit has demonstrated its usability and necessity, considers Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit provides different reports to other police officers.
In an emergency, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
Reform of fresher working methods
Setting up analysis units is a reform of the latest police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to ensure that the police are more and more likely to take off the whistles when they receive an alert.
With the information collected and analysed by the unit, daily police activities are targeted where it is most necessary to do so.
A single criminal intelligence centre, under three national units, and each police department, was set up with the reform of the local government.
The PTR Centre in the context of the central criminal police in Vantaa is run nationally by the PTR Centre.
In PTR units, people from the police, customs and border guards work according to their name.
The RTA units, in turn, work according to the police departments in the divided areas and are responsible for providing information to both the local police and the national units.
Intelligence has the effect of outside the territory of the country.
Where a single police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on in the entire area of the police department.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution, because that is what crime does.
Those working in the RTA unit have better computer skills than the Basic Police.
With the help of registers, alert database and observations, the unit seeks to draw the police's attention to new phenomena, productive criminal or similar offences.
This is referred to as a series, and it is one of the most important criminal intelligence tools available.
Everyone has their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it is genuine or criminal.
On the basis of the method of action, a certain image is formed of the author.
The selection may be made either on the basis of the way in which it is made or on the basis of a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes.
RTA unit workers do not travel in the city with collars standing up, but their work is not fully public.
The methods used by both criminals and criminals are not being reported, as this could result in professional criminals developing their activities and thus seeking to prevent police law enforcement efforts.
The police will publicly report on the conduct if it foresees a threat to them.
This case, for example, was updated from early summer, using the identification of empty dwellings used in housing breaches.
The authors put the apartment in the outer door with a stick, a pin or a piece of tape they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The pre-testing material shall be made public at least to the interested parties.
The analysis unit has found that professional criminals are learning from mistakes they have made.
The nobility order the minutes of the district court, which may indicate, for example, that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we're going to steal a glove with our hands on it.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Commissioner Tero Seppä on Hämee Police, Inspector Tuomo Lepola on East Finland Police, Detective Inspector Sami Joutjärvi on the Joensuu Police Station and Inspector Arto Tuomela on the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information that enables the planning of practical activities.
In the background, the decrease in labour and financial volumes will be brought about by a reduction in the volume of labour and finance.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last amendment was a three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation shall collect information from outside the borders of its own institution and Finland.
A schoolgirl related to fathers from London was killed in Syria.
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolworkers who left London last year to join Isis, has been reported to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasname Akunjee said that the family heard this dead in Syrian Raqqa a few months ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that he was believed to have been killed by Russian air raids on Raqqa, the organisation's base in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was planning to escape from the country of war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of this case is that it can act as a tombstone and as a testament to others that there is a real risk of leaving the war zone - that it could cause people to abandon the decision to make such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other Eastern schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that the girl had married Isis in Syria and that she had only become a widow after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will consider Mr Garland to be the candidate for the Supreme Court of Garland if he is elected.
President of the Senate, Harry Reid, says that he is convinced that Hillary Clinton, president of the Democratic Federation of Presidents, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Senate Republics have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mr. Mitch McConnell, director of the majority of the Senate, says that the next President will elect the most senior right of the person who has passed over to Mr. Antonin Scalia to replace him.
Reid said at the telephone conference on Thursday that he would predict "with a degree of certainty" by Clinton's chosen Garland.
The representative of the Reid later stated that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would appoint Garland and that it was speculation.
He complimented Garland and said that the Clinton team would not like to "play the boat" with a new option.
Garland is the Supreme Judge of the Court of Justice of the United States District of Columbia.
Reid said that Republics that prevented Garland from being appointed were the "movers" and "reporters" of Donald Trump, President of the Republican Federation of Presidents of the Republics.
He said that Trump was not fit for office.
Treats says that a low-level calendar is "women as well as men".
Dates magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemer to publish the calendar inspired by Pirell in the 1970s for 2017.
Instead of being a nude celebrity, they intend to find their next peak generation in 2017 NU Mys calendar.
The President of the Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his magazine, which contains a lot of nude images, is different from the Playboy of the old school because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for the ladies.
Apparently, he thinks that each one is for them too.
"We must start again to present timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the naked body", said the press release in which the release was made public.
Women may be part of this project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can leave images online or in personally transparent selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Destination of the styling: Who really buys discs?
Single, middle-aged men love wild animals.
Before you try to fill in a comment on irritable infringements that are written by the author not all single-aged men, you will find that this argument is based on real data.
According to YouGov, a lot of talk about re-entry of disks is not because more and more people born in this millennium are excited about the novelty of physical objects, but about the flood of middle age.
Apparently, those who have bought the vinyl plate in the near future are likely to be 45-54 years old.
In fact, in all likelihood, discs are most likely to be purchased by 18-24-year-olds age group.
The issue is not only about collecting amateurs, but also about having a sense of emotion: it is more likely that those who buy vinyl are more likely to like their feelings (56 % vs 53 %) and enjoy being alone (69 % vs 66 %).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me when I'm in the middle of a busy street at Soho, I'd be wearing a modest gray suit. I'd be quick to wave before I come, I'd make up my hands and I'd say something authoritative, like, "Let's find out more."
Let's take a closer look at this.
While Soho's charm and dirt is slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants, shops and office stores are now building buildings with previous independent movements - a lot of amazing specialty disc stores are still in place.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to different men in some of these shops when I try to assess their age and emotion.
Glasgowian Stuart, 55 followed by Sister Ray (the counter: two young women, three middle-aged men) in the Rectless Records (the counter: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably twenty-two), spends her afternoon in London due to a meeting, and tours the shops in order to spend a few hours.
I'll ask him if he's a collector.
"I'm all right," he says.
I've got about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates that appear above the picture (for sending a sample by e-mail, I did not follow her home), cover the walls of her living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge amount of disks and singles is partly due to his available income: now he can buy discs that he could not afford when originally published, and he can re-purchase those that he sold when he was young and broke.
"A great deal of the material I bought is from the late '60s and early 70s, the albums that were published when there were 11 or 12, the albums that I was probably too young to obtain," he says.
He agrees that the buyers of the albums are probably introverts who enjoy their company and adds: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my bad."
Wez, 25-year-old, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he has encountered fit in with the YouGov profile.
However, he has noticed the new wave of people affected by media enthusiasm, people who have heard that the plates have come back to fashion and who have had the chance to buy back their old albums.
On the basis of the discussions I have had, people have been separated from their collections in 1998 or 1999 as a general rule.
Customers who sold their gadgets to buy CDs are now selling their cds to buy their albums back," he says.
This may lead to an increase in the number of wine awakes of certain age groups.
But what about the alleged sentimental meaning of the discs?
In a trade like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to realize that disc shops offer comfort to similar Community types of people.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured, in particular by the short-term payment system.
Some vinyl fans can fool themselves from a digital world and choose to trust in the stability of familiar disk files; objects that create memories of a teen-age happy day.
"I think that sometimes it might be about filling in a hole or some kind of comfort that owns things," Wez says.
As the collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to make ideas.
"We're like their social workers!" the other worker said, "unmistually, from the record."
The April ICM opinion poll revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl plate last month had not yet considered it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% do not have a record player.
In this section of the news report, I would probably look seriously concerned to see the stack of bossa nova collections on my back.
This "feature" aspect of the alarm is something that Jonny, 42, who works for the Sounds of the Universe (the counter: three middle-aged men), is also aware of.
"Somebody came in a little while ago and said, "I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead album so we can put it on a shelf", he says.
This is not a big part, but this is absolutely the case.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not the parents, but the younger people, the late-age people who are just getting excited about it.
In a cabinet where today an almost entire floor is reserved for hot spots, I arrive at a much wider audience.
Seventy-five-year-old parades, tourists to take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the climate is less relaxed than in the previous movements - louden up Wild Beast's latest pop, sex-like pop, and no improvisation jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem to be very lonely, but it is difficult to prove that a dilapidating psychological trauma is happening at one side of the street for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes, looking at various discs in sales.
He's making purchases, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make a lot of money, so collecting the albums isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or through some other way, but the beauty of the violet is..." he goes in love with him.
"I don't know how to explain it - it's truly unique."
My last stop is said to have created a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to seem like I'm looking at the cockroaches, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering for a moment around the Polaroid cameras before Dad and daughter were thinking about buying a Crosley record player.
On the left there is a stairs that are covered with the albums of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates of any collection of averages.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are merely decorative, and others are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It is purely "art mines".
However, given the fact that even a small amount of attention received by these objects may mean more money for the industry and send some customers to Soho's people to collect more, this is not much to complain about.
It should not be surprising that the population, which is more likely to have more time and money, is also the one who uses the most luxury uses, such as rites.
Even though my findings suggest that youGov's results are correct at Soho's stores, they do not exclude the large number of fair collectors and violet lovers that exist in the real world, in discs and in network forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or in the office.
They really don't spend their Thursday mornings mazing around Berwick Street's record stores, going through plates and avoiding a creepy 30-year-old artificial drinker looking at this as he looks over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Holkeri is the most live live live animal - video report of the animal.
Scientists say that the Holker has a longer life span than any other planet on the back of the planet.

The Court of Justice rejects the application for the unloading of trade at the Jungle refugee camp in Jungle.
The French court has rejected the request of the Calais authorities to land tens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jugle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be able to land a total of 72 temporary trades, where people sell goods inside the camp from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell 50 cents (for 40 cents), or sell plainly in a few Euros in ad hoc restaurants.
Calais Preekt's office justified that the places would be decommissioned because they represent taxes on unpaid farms and because they are a risk of fire and cleaning.
Humanitarian groups have told the Court that trade and restaurants are vital in saying that the free meals offered by the State-supported organisation and other groups do not provide enough food for the increasing human being in the camp.
They argued that ad hoc shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free meals for those who need them.
In Lille, the Court of Justice stated that there were no legitimate grounds for deportation of 72 people who were in the middle of a temporary trade, but said that the question of Calais prefect "was perfectly understandable.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that stores, cafes and restaurants had a much bigger role to play than only feeding people "in extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the facilities offered peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under the discharge was the camp Jungle Book Kids' Cafe, whose activities are non-profit-making, offering 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors in the camp.
Over 700,000 people have signed an appeal to protect the child’s coffee shop.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe would be "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charity organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to peak - since the number of arrivals hit strongly during the summer.
The price of food in Finland is falling more often than in the EU on average in Finland.
Food is becoming extremely cheap in Finland for the pleasure and trouble of consumers and producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly five per cent in Finland in three years, while in the EU countries their prices have fallen by VAT per cent on average.
At the same time food in Germany and Sweden has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices in Finland have fallen to two most in the EU countries with the same wage level as in Finland.
In Britain alone, the price of food has fallen more than in Finland.
The information is presented in the publication of Statistics Finland's Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen's article published in the Data & Trends blog.
Entrepreneur compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportionate to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest data will be from June this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013 prices fluctuated close to 1994 price levels.
The situation had to be alarmed.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," says Lehtinen.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper for a year.
Now the Russian import bans on food, imposed at prices by Russia, have failed to export food from Finland to Russia.
The supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have decreased.
"Putin's policy has helped a Finnish consumer with a short-term goal," Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition between industry and trade has also affected the fall in prices.
The large trade chains S-group and Kesko have both calculated their prices.
For the consumer, the competition has been seen as a display of promotional campaigns.
Finland is still not a source of favourable food, even though the price of food has fallen greatly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive EU country in Finland, with a level of pay similar to that of Finland.
According to the magazine, the price of food sold in Finland has a significant effect on value added tax.
He found that if the analogue countries had the same percentage of VAT, the third cheapest food would be sold in Finland from the countries with the same wage level as the third lowest priced food.
Lehinen compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in comparison countries, only the Germans and the Dutch would be more affordable food than the Finns.
"If we want to get to the old EU countries at the price of food, we need to halve the VAT on the average of the EU countries and continue the price competition", Lehtän writes.
Note that the percentage of VAT calculated by him is indicative.
The school is no longer exactly the same as it is.
Returning to the school bench may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the academic period in all primary schools, has been developed.
It is a guide according to which all Finnish schools operate.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New instructions have been prepared for several years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of a journal is abandoned, and, on the other hand, the school is starting to practice coding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education begins at the fourth level.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
It used to be thought that the teacher would teach students, but now everyone should be active and learn from each other.
This is how you try to make school visits more interesting.
The life of the most long-last long-last long backs he was found - the ice ice cold may live up to 400 years of life, up to 400 years, and up to 400 years of life.
Yähikanin’s well-known Greenland halibut (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches the age of 150.
It may then live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The figures make the species the longest long-lasting vertebrate in the world.
In the natural world, it is only passed by an Icelandic shrub whose oldest known individual has been scheduled for 507 years.
Landland sharks travel all the way to the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch the dogs longer, they can grow to over five meters.
Since the growth rate is slow, the follow-up indicates that only about a centimeter a year, the adult individuals have lived for a long time.
For how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University, together with his colleagues, found out.
He determined the age of adult ice-creams from the 28 females that had remained in fishermen's fishing gears.
The age of fish was revealed by radio-carbonisation of eye lenses.
The average duration of the search was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters were found to be about 335 and 392 years old.
As it has been found in previous studies that the ice-hainars are less than four metres old, researchers calculated that they were about 150 years old at that time.
The publication of this study was published in The Science.
Emissions from Stocking to almost 300 - sellers will not be deducted from the deduction of salesmen.
Almost 300 employees are hired from Stockmann, a freight company.
The Joint Undertakings in a company in difficulty ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the awards, approximately 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will take place in the form of layoffs," Stockmann explains in his information.
According to it, the number of traders in the trades will not be reduced so that the customer service does not pay.
In addition, some 80 employees of support activities are offered new jobs as a seller.
The YT negotiations in Stockmann concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the reduction need was estimated to be around 380 workers.
This reduction is intended to target annual savings of around EUR 20 million, which are due to take place next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme with a view to achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulties in Stockmann’s ability to make goods trade profitable.
Although the Group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, trade in goods still makes losses.
According to Stockmann’s CEO, Lauri Vejalainen, sales in the trade sectors have not achieved the objectives set by the company.
"The reduction in human resources is, unfortunately, necessary to ensure the positive result of Stockmann Retail in 2018", says Veijalainen in the bulletin.
The result of the second quarter was particularly driven by the good success of Lindex in the food chain.
The Ketju achieved the net sales and profits of the best second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating profit of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million cost-effective.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's net sales for this year will fall last year.
The adjusted operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - the temperature is less than 20 degrees in the whole country.
The low pressure centre in the north of Finland keeps the weather rainy Friday, reports H's meteorologist Ilona Ling.
There will also be rainfalls in the central parts of the country, but south is poury.
The temperature is no longer very summer, as mercury is below 20 degrees in the whole country.
In the northern rain areas, 10-15 degrees remain in the north.
Kena's public sports team is shaking the dopingsandal coach's speeding a strange explanation.
Austrian sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympic Olympics in Rio after it turned out that Anzrah was a national team athlete in the doping test.
The press agency AP reported that the athlete Anzrah tried to appear is a 800-meter star of the Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap, a member of the national team leader of Kenya, said that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a demonstration of Rotichina in the surprise test.
The Doping Officers came to the authorities of Anzra to report to the authorities of Anzra.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because "he committed a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behaviour", the president of the Kenia Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, on behalf of the news office Reuters.
Olympics' public sports begins on Friday, and Rothin is scheduled to run right at the time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was ranked fourth last year in the World Cup on the fourth and is an ex ante match for the winner of RA.
According to Reuters, the source in Kenya's public sports team claimed that Anzrah was only allowed to travel with an athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he was afraid to reveal himself," he said.
Who is everyone?
An empty numeral of a public sports platform in Rio is an important part of its empty space.
Where is everyone?
At least at the Olympic Stadium in Rio, they will not be watching public sport at the Olympic Stadium.
On Rio, a Friday’s struggle was started on public sports medals, but the world’s top ideas were able to demonstrate their skills to an unsuspecting naked view.
On the Friday, the Ži organisations reported that only 58% of the first day’s morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets were sold.
The second one was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulsing from a cheering crowd.
The finals' flags are already sold out in the country.
Even before public sport, the loss of the Olympic Olympics has attracted attention to the loss of audiences.
For example, thousands of empty parks have been seen in Rugby, Melon and Horse Viewings, for example.
When Brazil’s medalheads Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played the beach volleyball in the original Copacabana, only 70% of the scene was full.
After the other two, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12,000 views were full.
At least the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far removed from European and Asian racing tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to the used Brazilians.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian football team could not have been flushed to a football stadium.
Mario Andrada, an official of the contestants, reported at the weekend that 82% of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly lower than four years ago.
"There is still 1.1 million left for sale," Andrada said according to Reuters.
8.2 million of the 8 000 London Olympic flags were sold, even though the flags cost nearly half as much as the Ostrobothnia flags.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from around nine euros to over a thousand euros for openings.
Over half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16 per ticket.
At the London Olympics volunteers and military staff were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because the organisers are in need of money and are trying to get tickets to the market until the last minute.
True, operators have given 240,000 tickets to less well-known species in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were empty places at the Rio Stadium this afternoon.
Even a beach volleyball in the Copacaba sand has no interest in the audience.
Jukka Kessalo was competing in London in 2012.
People's magazines have had enough.
A new way to protect nature - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in nature conservation by new means.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically important natural areas of ownership.
After that, private, corporate and community entities can redeem the right to land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The area has been allocated in a virtual way to the blocks that those willing to purchase for payment of the right of right.
The administrator receives the right of veto in a section of 187 square sizes, which in practice means that each holder is not required to be approved if the use of the land is intended to be changed.
Administration rights can also be acquired in more than one cell.
The acquisition of jurisdiction is something concrete that can be left for inheritance or given as a gift.
There is no need to go carrying banners or chaining yourself somewhere to protect nature," says Juha Levikov, who acquired control over the property.
The contracting authority will receive accurate location information from its department, which will allow for example a visit to the block.
The names of the rightholders on the Foundation’s website, which appear on the Foundation’s website, shall appear on the same map as the country’s parcel data.
The grass sees its nature conservation procurement as a risk only if the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting the protection of the environment and the environment.
The reason is that the Foundation would act in some unethical or commercial way, but that should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Manager project is the protection of natural habitats so that they can remain intact and at peace.
The foundation acquires land either by buying or by making a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of rights, but the Foundation has acquired its initial capital from its founders.
The purpose of the foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It also aims outside Finland's borders and plans to re-integrate from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop-up forest at the Helsinki Market on 13-19 August.
Cycling thieves torture large cities most of all Thupu - look at the situation in your home.
Cyclists torture Finland’s large cities, the worst of all, in the world of Turku by cyclists.
This year there has been stolen from the population in proportion to the number of inhabitants more round than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of the cyclists reported to the police, the number of bicycles and parts thereof stolen in the ten largest cities this year in January to August per thousand inhabitants has been determined.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to the police, there were four to five bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, the police were informed only about two cyclists per thousand inhabitants.
There's a big difference.
“In other cities there are double thefts relative to the number of inhabitants,” explains Tommi Reen, Inspector of the Police Board of Finland.
The police in Turku are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than in other countries.
I have no answer to that.
"The general public may be affected by how much the city moves around and how many wheels there are at all", says Sergeant Teemuäs.
Tommi Reen, the Board of Directors of the Board of Directors, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise relatively high.
The amount of bicycle theft goes largely depending on the cities of study and trading.
The market has a central center, short distances and plenty of round supply for thieves.
For example, Espoo is a very different city, where urban centres are far away from each other and bicycles are not necessarily a primary means of transport," Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police information has become a little less about bicycle theft in January to August than in the same period last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police will receive little more than 20 000 cyclists per year.
It means 50-60 fibrils every day and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 people per year.
"They're huge amounts," Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only some of the victims report theft to the police.
Reen calls on people to make a crime report on cyclists, even if it is less recent than any 10th of the police reported to the police.
Typically cleared bicycle theft is where the police receive information about the theft immediately and the thief is caught in blood.
"There are also cases in other investigations where, for example, a drug case apartment may have stolen wheels," Reen says.
In Helsinki, cyclists will be caught weekly in connection with their own work or police investigation, says Senior Officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, the wheels are stolen from, for example, the bicycles, interiors, warehouses and bicycles of the shopping mall, i.e. virtually everywhere they are usually stored.
Of the individual wheel models, the most stolen are the previous years' way of doing Things.
U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
For example, some people take a loop for their own use, but most of the stolen circuits end up sold online, for example.
They remain on the domestic market.
"At least it hasn't been known to the police that there's a lot of stolen balls going abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the shoppers of stolen wheels are common Finns.
I'm sure you can buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
A used-up buyer must be careful, as he may be guilty of a hiding offence or infringement.
"The alarm bells should be ringing if a good spin is sold to the bottom of the clear", Reen says.
Severi Härvi, the publisher of the library Severi Härvi, bears the colour Nopsa for his working day for the protection of the library of Kallio in Helsinki for the duration of his working day.
He's had five wheels, but no one's been stolen, the monster says. "There's never been taken, there's been a good monk."
"Maybe this does not attract thieves so much, this may not be a hipster value," the Helsinki Horrible wonders.
Siuri Valve, who quickly visited the Kyosk in Kallio in Helsinki, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now the wheel threw a kisosk against the wall, but in general, Valve is locking his bike on something tight, like a bike.
"There will be a lot to think about, because this bicycle is the most expensive thing to own," says the Helsinki student on his white bike, whose body alone spent about five hundred euros.
"How long does it take to hear from your friends that you've been taken away."
"Mostly bad wheels, such dirty boys."
A bicycle was stolen from the control of the company's inner yard a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been compromised, Valve could expect it to be stolen.
Under the age of 15 responsible for his crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with a peer review team known from the United States of America.
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-review team is being tried to prevent young people from becoming involved in a crime cycle.
The initial experiment is applicable to persons under the age of 15, who are now left without criminal liability.
The peer review team is missing the first young person to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer panel will discuss what happened with the offender and impose a penalty.
A week later, the offender may himself join the peer panel in order to verify what he has done.
For example, the other consequences may be a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Latio, the youth director, tells us that the model is not strict.
We also have other models of mediation that are used in parallel.
"All young people are led in a more responsible way so that they do not get involved in the first mistake," Latio says.
A model of the United States of America, where it is widely used, has been taken on board by the peer review team.
The idea is that the young person, after his first murder, will not face the adult panel, but will reflect on what has happened with those of about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The service author of Palmu, who followed the trial, Ilkka Lovio, says that this was an assault that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first cases of persons under 15 years of age may not have been discussed before.
"It's been a message to keep up your choice on the road," says Lovio.
The peer review team is part of the Helsinki Project for Immigrant Youth, which is based on the City of Helsinki and Me Foundation.
The review underlines that new policies are offered to all people who need them, not just to the immigrant youth.
More than 70 Republican players want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign.
Over 70 Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to cease funding the Presidential campaign of Donald Trump.
The book was reported by the United States newspaper Politico, who had received a draft for that purpose.
According to the magazine, the open letter is addressed to the President of the National Committee of Republics of the Republics, Reince Priebus.
The authors would like the Party's money to be channelled to the Congress elections instead of the Olympic campaign.
"We believe that the differences created by Donald Trump and his negligence, incompetence and record disadvantages threaten to bring these in elections to the Democrats a sound circuit," says Politico.
The direct trend in all possible assets towards the Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning in the Trump-decorated anchor at their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, since the chances of winning the Presidential election will decrease from day to day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent over next week.
Among those who have signed are politicians such as Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organised persons in the letter is obviously the Republic of Andrew Weinstein, the Republic of the Republic against the Trump.
According to the politician, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority of the people in the United States" and that it is not about supporting anyone.
The letter lists a number of actions by Donald Trump, which are believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working in the field of national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton's permission to provide relief for families with children in the United States of America.
In the United States, President-in-Office of the United States, Hillary Clinton, United States, told of the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I am trying to make sure that the U.S. economy goes well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy is doing well for him and his friends," Clinton said.
The Clinton plan is focused on a massive five-year programme of $275 billion to improve US infrastructure, roads, bridges and airports.
This would be the case in the case of the various increases in taxes, in the case of private money.
The construction programme is a hand allocation for the American southern edges that suffer from the shift of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme a major investment in well-paid jobs after World War II.
We are the people of the art, we must go back to construction.
Clinton said.
Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children working in the workplace.
On Thursday he sounded like Sanders when he pointed out that the real people would have to pay a fair share of the taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States for tax liability, it has to pay the tax, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he supported before it.
"As President, I object to any trade agreement that operates against employees or wages", Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was going to criticise the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it would “only favour millionaires of this kind”.
With more than any bid, Clinton has previously called the "Trump loophole" a reduction in company tax.
Thursday Clinton stressed that she was the daughter of a small enterprise.
He reminded the hearers of small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump has not paid and of the items Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America," Clinton pointed out.
These are Rio's viewers: Cats have not glued Finns to the screens, but mobile applications are interesting.
Usually sports competitions appear in TV viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Olympic Olympics in Rio have not reached a lot of ratings.
At one time, competitions have glued at the top of the squares 12% of the population: on Tuesday night the swim was followed by 615 000 viewers from the High Olympics TV2 at the same time.
For the sake of comparison: six-monthly public sports EM competitions received nearly 800,000 viewers each time over TV2, and the football EM competitions received a fair second million.
Most of the Olympics have so far been interested in the Sunday night’s biking and the fiveth day of the competition, which both reached the Olympics at a time with nearly half a million viewers.
The Yle Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the ratings, and reminds that viewers are divided into several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition to television, the Finns will be following the Olympic Olympics from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers in general choose the Olympics.
On the television side, viewers are divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympic Olympics in Rio are the first sports competitions that Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast arrives 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000 all the time, that is a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in 2012 in London or 2008 in Beijing, but the difference is explained in part by the time difference - a large proportion of Ž’s broadcasts come to Finland during the nighttime.
Another reason for the lack of interest - if someone now thinks it's a thin one - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken one of the surprises of the initials, the interest would have gone up with it.
In addition, sport in general is only beginning, as is the case with other Finnish interested species: sailing and horse riding.
The initial ratings have been, according to Pokki, close to what was expected.
When public sport starts, viewers will explode.
Yle launched a Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for the competitions, which on the first days of the competitions went up at Apple App Store for Finland's most downloaded applications for free of charge.
By Monday, the application had been loaded 150 000 times.
I guess we're already heading for 200,000 downloads.
"We'll get the numbers of the online viewers later," says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked for all users as intended.
Positive says that feedback has been received and errors have been corrected.
Rio Areena’s use has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
Applications have produced up-to-date versions that should correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio will be more visible on the Yle channels and in the arena than any other sporting event ever before.
Yle Fem can be used to track some species, and Yle Talks can be broadcast on the Yle Fem network every day.
Olympics are not only the most working for the Yle, but also the last ones that can be followed only by the Yle channels.
From 2018, Olympic sports will be featured both on the Yle and on commercial channels.
How deep is Finland's deep lake?
According to official statistics, Finland's deepest lake is the Päijä, whose depth is 95,3 metres on the Cross.
It may be even deeper.
Technical research coach Matti Kannela found a 20-square-metre cut from the crossside, the bottom depth of which was found in 104 meters by the diving machine.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency attempted to confirm the observation by means of a so-called so-called so-called so-called so-called ‘externalisation’.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 meters, says Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, therefore, the official depth is still 95,3 metres.
The deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 metres) and Suvasvee (90 meters).
More than 80 metres from Saimaa, Toisvesi and Peajärvi.
They haven't been studied as well as on Sunshine.
The bottom of Inarijärvi has not been carefully mapped.
"There could well be unknown deeps from there," Kannella wondered.
If the deep lake is determined by means of a central depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As a result, your Sunshine will not get into the ten deepest groups and Suvasvei will still be at a distance from the tip.
Correction 12 August at 14.29: Revised last paragraph, where the most deep lakes in central depth were wrong.
A beautiful tax field: Pensioners' tax continues to be tighter.
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that there was a misfortune under parliamentary elections and that it was promised equal taxation of pensioners against employees.
This is not the case in the Government's draft.
We think that that would definitely be the case.
The promised promises should be continued after the election, he will tell the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, employees received a reduction in their earnings, which reduced taxation.
The matter warmed up the opposition representatives of the Parliament, who giggling the then Minister of Finance Alexander Stubbi (coc.) for the election promises.
The purchasing power will be secured, it will not grow.
In the line presented by the Minister of Finance, Petter Orpon (Kok.), Ihalainen believes that the main issue of tax reductions is to safeguard purchasing power and not increase it, as next year no increase will be made.
He says that the tax reduction will have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) and Orpo with the intention of respecting the Treaty of Accession, which has been reached with great pain.
He says that it is crediblely important to respect this agreement..
It is the main economic and employment policy activity of a regular period.
It has been made with the powers of the industry, so it should not be called into question.
This will be necessary because the economy is so much for domestic demand and for people to believe in their own future.
Long-term unemployment in the catchy turn of long-term unemployment.
Ihalainen appeals to the government to seize long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth, in a budget line.
In June, the number of long-term unemployed persons was around 17 000 higher than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72% will run away.
He warns that if the challenge of long-term unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline in the permit.
Ambassador: There are no known Finnish victims of attacks in Thailand.
At least four people were killed in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The embassy invites Finnishs to be alert in the country and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for Finnish civil servants to withdraw their travel to Thailand because of the explosions, but there is a precautionary need to follow the instructions of the embassy, says Westphalen.
Very few Finns in the suburbs are very few in the suburbs.
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their precise number is difficult to estimate.
The period of travel by Finns in Thailand is scheduled for an annual period of time.
Most Thai tourists come from Southern Europe and China this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The embassy has tried to reach out to Finns in particular in Hua Hin, in order to get information on the local situation.
However, several of our contact persons at Hua Hin are gone at the moment.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, says Westphalen.
No known reason for its development.
According to Westphalen, there is not yet any information on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The Ambassador believes that events may be linked to the political restlessness of the Thai society and to last week's referendum on the constitution of the military junta.
The Act was adopted by a vote.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, there were arrests for people who said they were against the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic-national conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
The Muslims want to add to the right of self-regulation.
However, since then, the attacks have not been extended to tourist sites.
It's a big, local day in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
According to him, the town celebrates the Queen's birthday and the Mother's Day.
Transport in the city is very small.
The effect of these attacks on the day's flow is that the authorities are very precise in terms of security.
Thai police: The attacks are not about international terrorism.
According to the police, attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from ordinary terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism is also excluded, says the Thai police according to AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand during the last 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the tourists' favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the favourite tourist destination in Finland, the holiday island in Phuket exploded at night by four bombs, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
Current data show that they did not demand death victims.
Two bombers from the bombs, according to a magazine, at Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the magazine.
According to the local authorities, in Hua Hin, a total of four bombs have exploded yesterday and today.
At least one died in both double-bomb attacks.
In addition, at least one bomb exploded in both of them in South Thailand in the village of Surat Than and in the town of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists, as it is a way to go to Ko Samu, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
The factor of the attacks is unknown.
According to Prayut Chan-O-Cha, director of the controlled military junta in Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We don't have to make people panic any more, he told the reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, Deputy Prime Minister for Security, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are connected.
He told Tai BSB that the purpose of the targets was to destroy the country's trade because all attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people to be alert and to avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish people who are going to Thailand should not withdraw their journey due to explosions, but it is wise to follow unwarranted guidance from a precautionary point of view, says Westphalen.
In the case of Europeans who are affected, the Europeans are in a position to act as Europeans.
Very little is known about the attacks during the summer night and their victims.
About last night's attack in Hua Hin, a little more information has been needed about Hua Hin.
The local woman died and more than 20 others were wounded, including at least nine foreign tourists.
At least among the wounded are Germans, Italians, Dutchs and Austrians.
At least three people were injured in the last attack by Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded near the well-known bell tower.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from an area where it believes it will find another bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower bench, according to the governor of the county.
At the time of the attack, a municipal worker was killed.
There is at least one case of vulnerability.
The chief of police interviewed by the CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded approximately half an hour ago.
According to Post, bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Biles won the women's quadruple.
The United States of America Raisman was the second point on 6 March 1998 and the Russian Subja Blackfina was the third with 58,665 points in performance.
Biles, 18, still aims for telemetry in Rio's competitions on perm, jump and boom.
Biles has been in control of women's gymnastics in the past few years to a large extent.
For three of his previous years, eight personal world betrotheds from each of the previous three years.
He has won three consecutively and in the last year and the second year of the year in the fourth round and permancan titles.
The United States team in Biles has reached the world-wide level of the two team competitions.
Shorter MM medals The Biles have a jump and a fag.
Taiwanese civil servant: "The father has no effect on tourism".
Esa Huvila, who runs the real estate agency in Phuket and the children’s playground in the same property, has not been concerned about the impact of the attacks in Thailand on the audience.
If there are no more attacks, I don't think it's going to be any more amazing, but as a Finnish company in Asia, it's estimated that Huovila, who worked in Asia for some twelve decades, is the Finnish company.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many of Thailand's tried tragedys.
There's always something.
At first there was a tsunami, then a bird flu, and last year there was a bomb attack in Bangkok.
If these formers have not deported the turses, then no one will.
The hospital’s office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
The lobby heard a blow from its own staff.
The employee called about nine local hours and said that it was not worth coming to the office.
Huvila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local staff arrived at the workplace in the morning as usual.
They thought the roadblock had been set for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to the anniversary in Thailand.
The atmosphere at Patong was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open about 10 o'clock local time.
Many people on the beach had never even heard of attacks.
Half-thirty days at the Thai time at Patong, traffic was normalized and much of the trades had opened its doors.
On the basis of the site of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the site of the attack.
Later that car was seen at the Jouxholmini in Kruunjusk.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The patrol found two men matching the signs hiding in the nearest six.
Another man was caught immediately.
The other one escaped, but the man was later found in the woods using a police dog.
Men are suspected of stealing, stealing and committing gross damage to motor vehicles.
The police thank those who gave me the tips.
Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Foreign Affairs and Security: Clear
On Friday, high-ranking leaders were made in Russia for years when President Vladimir Putin separated the head of his administration from Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov’s successor is Anton Vaino, 44 years old, Estonian-based Anton Vaino.
He's an ex-diplomat and worked as Ivanov's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the cause of Ivanov’s dismissal may be Putin’s desire to prevent strong people from taking too much power around him.
He adds that the recycling of executive functions is one way of controlling power.
This is a way of preventing people from asking for the President to exercise self-responsibility.
According to the Kangaspur, it is also possible that Ivanov has been in contact with other directors or has failed.
Armour drop to Ivanov.
Ivanov, a member of the inside of Putin, is going to be assigned tasks in the field of environment and transport.
On the tape presented by the state media Putin referred to the change as a common decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for the transfer of duties and proposed a replacement of persecution, said Russia Today.
The fabric purro says that Ivanov's view is a clear fall in position.
In Russia, environmental and transport affairs are not very high in order of priority.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of the Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era at the KGB during the Soviet era.
He was considered to be a possible successor of Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev was elected president.
Kangaspuro points out that the old guard, such as governors, has recently been replaced in Russia.
Senior Researcher Katri Pynönniemi from the Institute of Foreign Affairs says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's site is that Putin is going to change his/her area of interest more highly.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human factor when they withdrew from Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield when they fled to Jarabulus in order not to target them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, the Arab and Kurdish fighters gained around 90% of the important city of Manbij for their people.
According to estimates, however, ten jihadists remained in town at the time.
Revised news at 7:30 p.m.: In the past, we were wrongly told that civilians were on the run from the city, in fact, Isis fighters kidnapped civilians while they fled from the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior’s Documentary Directorate is unlawful.
The Ministry of Interior’s orientation on public disclosure is unlawful, says Tomi Virutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland, Professor of Public Law.
A multi-stakeholder tells the STT that the document can't be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of Interior refused to release the list of participants at the Minister of the Interior’s events to the evening-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision on the instructions of the Government Office and on the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not on the file.
The Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tells the STT that there is a noticeable need to reform the policies of the Ministry.
Usai Bolti’s last Olympics show begins in Osai.
In recent years, Bolt has been running against time under value charges.
He hurt his past in the early days and had to skip the Olympic Games in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I am in a much better condition.
I've been doing well and that's the key thing, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
The press conference included low-dressed pillar dancers and fans who turned into fans.
While around the Pomina Bolt, it is clear that the Jamaican star has risen during the period when public sport has been struggling with doping scandals and sledding interest.
The last loss of Bolt at the Olympics came to Athens in 2004, when he lost 200 meters early at 21.05 p.m.
At that time, Bolt, aged 17, was a young promise slowed down by injuries and loose exercise.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, where he crushed the world record and the competitors’ confidence in the end of the grand jury in spite of the year 9,69.
This is hard to do.
One year later, in the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the mark at the clock.
World records created in Europe are 9,58 at 100 metres and 19 in the 19th century are still valid.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is reaching 200 metres of world record and 19 seconds below world record, but nobody believes that it is created but Bolt himself.
In the 100th century, the Botti’s first challenger is Justin Gatlin, the winner of the Athenian 2004 100 Olympic Award winner.
Last year in the Beijing World Cup, Bolt defeated the American in just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has not lost its worth in the finals of value losses since the reign of Beijing, if only has been completed.
In Daegus 2011, the 100-mmm final was left on Bolt for running for a fake start.
Bolt fills up for more than a week after 30.
He's an old man among young men, and Rio's competitions are his last Olympics.
For the first time in a career, Bolt has set the World Cup in London next year.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest of the world.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.
Distinguishings about Italy: two athletes are suspected of doping.

He was located in Rio, fourth of all, on a hundred-metre fly-in flight of women.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estao, the Chinese fin has taken a case of doping before the International Court of Appeal for Sport CAS.
Xinhua tells us that a sample of Xinyin Sunday would have shown signs of a diuretics called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspicions of doping have also been reported in Rio.
The BBC wondered that Bulgarian female drunkard Sylvia Danekov had given a doping sample showing signs of epi-hormones.

The International Olympic Committee on Thursday reported that the Kenyan coach had acted as an athlete in a test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is Kenian fast-run coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been on a 800-meter race pass from the runner Ferguson Rochi.

I'm just trying to have a little fun, Olympic Commenter of the BBC, Helen Skkelton's laugh at the quick interview with the press.
The case of Helen Skkelton (of course) on Monday is one of the most readings this week on the website of the Evening Newspaper.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skkelton is not much stress if the som or British press has a small mess of his undiscovered and special costumes.
Television is a visual media, he stresses.
Skkelton has put on high-interest shoes and short dress, which certainly has at least sufficient transparency - at least for many conservative British girls.
However, back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and small cases are just a funny thing.
Skkelton certainly wants to be astounded and perhaps astounded, but he points out that he does not want to play the main role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't really matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the court has reached Finland?
I can't, but all that matters is how much these swimmers are doing and how much they're making, it's okay for me, Skkelto grinning.
You know what?
It comes out of nowhere if it comes from (the drinker) looking out.
I'm a little amused if this guy's hit someone's radar.

The Argentinian lady was advocating Petja-Sirenä - Finnish questions about protest.
Tuuli Pető-Siren had a colourful competition day at the same time.
Tuuli Pető-Sire experienced hard on Thursday.
On Thursday, the Argentinian lady was Parker Tuul Petja-Siren at the opening of the day of female surfing in Rio on Thursday.
The wind was broken clearly.
The opponent issued a breach.
He got stuck because of the crash, and the others escaped, the Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
An athlete would consider long-term protest.
It was not worth doing so, because it would have been in line with the Olympic rules.
I should have dropped in the water so I could have been compensated, Petja-Siren said.
The Finnish people hung on their decks until the last time, because they did not want to go into the dirty water in Rói.
The Finnish person remained in place of the 27th time after the crash.
In the overall situation, London's 2012 Olympic Capital medal for 2012 is the eighth.
The damage to the fever does not have much effect on the crash.
Friday is an important day when it is time to race for departures 10-12.
Modify 2013/9: Unlike from the first information, Petja-Siren did not object.
7 specific issues which, according to science, are long-term on-age.
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These matters have been proven to bring extra years into the life of a person.
There are ways in which a person, directly or indirectly, is directly affected by things so that his life is extended.
Sometimes, things that you cannot influence yourself can bring him additional years.
These include, among other things, a tendency to have a central body household or social status.
Immediate shopping may be of a longer age.
There's always no need to be snuffed at all - just getting a milk cup is enough.
The long-term secret has been addressed through a number of different studies.
The Medical Daily rapporteur presented the five most recent results of the study.
Science suggests that all these things may lead to more life years.
Drinking beer and coffee.
It has been shown that culinary drinking protects against some cancer, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.
Research from Harvard University found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the "low risk of death", especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
On behalf of alcohol, the studies once again state that reasonable use - one in three days - may lead to prolonged life.
For example, one found that wine-drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
The normal use of a toothpaste can prolong a person’s life for up to six years, one study reports.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents the idea of being infected.
On the other hand, they can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases in other human bodies.
A study conducted in Norway found out how a person’s life was affected by a person’s life span.
The seven-year project surveyed more than 55,000 people.
Those who nabbed more were the most hideous individuals 35 per cent likely to survive after the end of the test.
Sex, when gender-related protection is taken into account, according to many studies, is good for health.
Besides, it can also last a lifetime.
It's just that having sex is not enough.
In order to gain additional years of life, a person should also have an orgasm.
Of course, mobility brings additional years, it is not a dispute.
However, reaching a long age does not require absolute solitude.
One study at Oxford University found that women with large buttocks had higher cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega 3 fatty acids.
The same study combined these elements with lower mortality.
Whether it was an athlete at the Olympics or an actor who won the Oscars, he is more likely to live longer than the usual layman.
Many research has tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation can be that an ambitious human is likely to live in a way that brings more years into his life.
Participants suspect that, for a long time, the social status of a person is due to - which, for its part, allows for the purpose of awards such as the Nobel Prize - for example.
A study on shopping behaviour among people over 65 years of age found that daily shopping is likely to be a parent who makes purchases.
This is due to the fact that, in the current trades, rounding reduces loneliness.
It has been re-assessed to launch biological mechanisms that may lead to death.
Thus, calculating your credit card by hand - online shopping does not therefore have the same effect.
A drunk drunk driver in the U.S. driver's car swept out towards the truck.

Post sent raspberry candy to the wrong city.
There were deficiencies in Salon K-City brand's bulky range because the mail had delivered part of the load to Seinäjoki by accident.
Teija Haltia, who was in the perni, was on Thursday to buy raspberry candy at Salon K-Citymarket when a funny sign hit his eyes.
There are product deficiencies in the UK because Posti delivered our loads to the Seinäjoki River.
We'll get more when Post gets the load delivered.
So if you don't fall in the lawn cut, you'll find out in the sign.
The trading sign relates to the fact that Posti extended its services last spring to grass cutting as well.
The grass cut is available for Post until the end of August.
According to the administrator, the chatter was mostly entertaining and decided to share it in social media.
The update's popularity hit me with an ass.
The representatives of the media have been calling all the time, and the point of this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia was over 700 copies on Facebook.
Haltia was able to get her own favorites caught in a wallet bag, even though a few of the lairs were empty.
Jaakko Kaideja, who was responsible for the business of Posti Business Transport Services, was sorry for the damage to Ista-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stagers were lost yesterday in the right place (Seinäjoki) and we were no longer going to make a sub-action (Salo) on three, but we only took five stage today, Kaedesoja told Evening Santom.
The first news of the matter is the Evening Sanomat.
Teija Halti did not complain about the sign because she found all her own favorite fruitcakes in the selection.

The court delivered Post a judgment on non-compliance with the equality law.
Post did not have the right to reserve the salary of the employee who refused to examine the temporary worker, judges the district court of Kanta-Häme in its judgment.
The court of origin ordered Post to pay the employee most of the amount of the salary withheld and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Posti could have arrested only a portion of the publisher's salary which corresponded to the share of the whole day's work in the media.
According to the district court, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to equality.
The staff member had complied with the decision of the Union for Post and Logistics (PAU) on a ban on marketing.
During last November's postage strike, PAU took a decision that Post employees would not be looking at temporary workers who break the strike.

In Flow, mass mass waste is a virtue.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of convenience have established Flow Festival's position as an internationally respected event aimed at the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival will begin on a Friday in Helsinki.
The painters have typically expressed themselves with their own personal work.
One of the artists on the main stage is this year's punk-legenda Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival event area is stowed by artificial grass and art installations, for example.
It has never been enough for us to be just a headboard and a beer, says Thomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
The Flow Festival held in the Gulf of Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small block festival to tens of thousands of visitors’ events.
As a result of the success, the simple question is: What kind of event do the authors want to go to?
In events, it is quite different to think this way.
Often, the objective is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the decisions, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end of this year's sale.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 last year by 5,000 people.
A number of interesting national and foreign artists are also seen at the festivals this year.
The increase in the quantity of the product is a good thing, because it's supposed to be funding in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much, because at any point, it would be like a cattle herd controlled by a huge lineage.
We don't want to.
The ideology of a successful event has expanded over 13 years with some of the presence of 130 sites, art installations, numerous restaurants and drink bars in the artificial grassed area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller performers, 15 000 tents will be available this year as a venue for the year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out again.
I may be a little crazy, but at the same time we've been able to preserve Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our thing anymore.
The greatest pleasure and reward for the work done is that even today, large visions are in practice possible.
In the early years of the event, activities in the mid-2000s were highly dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some 20 000 euros.
Last year, the turnover of a public limited company operating Flow was around EUR 6 million.
It can also create "creepy things", such as building a 73-foot wide tent.
Flow visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own personal dress.
In addition to the musical event, it is possible to talk about the community of trendy older adults.
However, the event is not consciously profiled as a very fashionable event.
The right to distinguish first and foremost with content is the right to separate.
Yet fashion phenomena also match Flow's values: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the top artists on the stage is a punk, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan group in his own generation, but he does not have the most typical features of the festival that combines indierck, pop music, rap and solo.
According to Kallio, Iggy was flattered because it is probably the last time this is seen in Finland.
We are interested in everything, the world and the future.
It's not just what's playing on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good and he's done a hell of a job in recent years.
The bombs of the Thai tourist destination were hidden in flower jars - tourists fled in their horrors.
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman was killed and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs had obviously been hidden in a flower jar and blew up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of which were foreign customers.
They were blown up while tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, according to the CNN of the police representative Samoer Yoosumra, CNN.
The image of your attacks by wild animal guardian Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia since 1989, is a great talk of the attacks of the wild animal guardian Edwin Wiek.
If the tv doesn't look good, you can take a look at it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded by the bar.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Emeli Olsson Aftonbladet, Sweden’s secretist Emeli Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than, the next morning of the local time.
At least one death.
The number of wounds is not yet known.
Shortly after this, two bombs exploded on the most popular island of Phuket as well as in Finland.
No one is known to be dead.
Meanwhile, there was another double-bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
The police informed them about Hua Hin, who had yet to explode, that at least one bomb was reported to be missing.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to the public authorities, there may also be criminal organisations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken advantage of the activities of criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new stand-by team leaves in the event of a war situation before the battle.
In an acute military situation, soldiers are asked to perform military duties only after several months after the oath of the military force, reports Central Finland.
According to the head of the Defence Forces interviewed by the magazine, Brig-Gen Jukka Sonninen, for example, 5.5 months of military service personnel in the event of a war, only those who are at the end of their training will be able to fight.
According to the Head of Education, first of all, the service is assigned to the service by the reserve personnel of the stand-by force.
No backup or reserve member is required to carry out a mission that has not been trained as required, says Sonnen.
Earlier in the summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces are about to train military personnel to the immediate standby units from next year.
If necessary, the units may be used for operations already during military training.
Pamela Tola received a second contribution from the Home House.
Actor Pamela Tola and her former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a fierce dispute about the housing they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The price of the dual-layered coal had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trading in the house, a serious moisture problem has been revealed, which has created a dangerous micro-nuclei for health.
The municipality announced that it would sell the dwelling as a decommissioning condition in 2014.
The sales price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so Tola and Waroma had lost up to EUR 1 9 000.
The couple brought the case before the court and demanded that the price be charged to the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the district and the province.
The court delivered a judgment on Wednesday.
It maintained the district court judgment ordering the seller to pay Tola and Warma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 per couple's costs of court and settlement.
The court held a slightly reasonable price reduction because a certain amount of the need to pay the dwelling had already been known by the purchasers in the course of the sale of the dwelling.
However, according to the court court, the manifested errors in construction were substantially more serious than what had been reported.
Tola is looking for a good home.
Tola told me in the marriage that the couple had actually sought a home of good faith because they didn't want to go back to work.
He had been given the impression that the building had been renovated and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the fitness check report would be of no harm to him.
The rehabilitation report mentioned the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of flooding rain and melting water.
However, the work did not show that it was in any way of urgency.
Tola and Waroma remained convinced that the rainwater of the late days might need to be channelled a little over a few years.
The trades took place in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the wetting problems of the apartment were much more likely to be serious than expected.
In 2012 and 2013, the buildings found microbial growth, according to the evidence, due both to the rainwaters of the rock and to the humid agriculture of the capillaryly.
On the west side of the house, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector's estimates, have reached the indoors through the porch as well.
A safe and safe-to-health-to-health-to-risk, limit values were found in the interior of the home-room, the basement stairs, the living room window and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also held a dispute as to whether the housing was in breach of the extended building permit.
The court ruled that Tola and Waroma had not known before the trade that the decision of the City of Espoo to change the residence was contrary to the consent of the City of Espoo.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there was not yet an appropriate permit.
However, problems were a key issue in justice.
According to court law, buyers, on the basis of the information they had received from the seller before the sale, assumed that the building was suitable for living on its own and that there was no need for substantial repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider that there was any reason for the court to carry out a wider standard audit.
The purchasers have not failed to fulfil their reporting obligations, the court ruling in its judgment.
Scary archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children in the Natsi register, including Finns.
In a recent article by Dagens Nyheter, the editor Christher Andsson writes that the National Library of the United States of Maryland has recorded microfilm records covering a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most women are German, but there are also U.S., French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, Norwegian and 14 Finnish women and 31 Swedish women wanted to be a Nazi bride.
The documents and licenses originate from the Nazi German Racial Office.
The racial office was under the authority of the SS Director-General Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he was examined by an SS doctor.
Equally, to an even greater extent, women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynaecological studies were carried out on women in order to find out.
The Racial Office examined the background of women, among other things, through the study of church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in women's lineage.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the race agency the manuscripts of life and good recommendations close to them.
The Racial Office wanted guarantees that women were "beloved children", "saves", and "good national socialists", who knew very much about German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as a bride of SS men.
The story is not about how 14 Finnish women found in the file were found in the archives.
The leaders of the SS created a state-supported program known as Lebensbor in 1936.
The programme provided, inter alia, that each SS official should have four children, whether in marriage or outside marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside their marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very active, but the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum are on the pages.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The State's initiative to get married provides loans and support for having children.
A German mother’s honour was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, the marriages between "Aryans" and "Non-Aryans" were legally prohibited, the site of the museum was noted.

Jari Sillahään Random City was taped for a couple of hours of nights: "I was so in a bag".
Jari Silalä has been a member of Finnish favourite artists for more than 20 years.
The Star of the cruise ship's barge to become the tango king of 1995, the solo artist most widely sold in Finland, and the Star of the Dances and Festivals, the Sillapää will continue to snort and she is currently at a sharp rise.
A book on the life of a pet singer, written by Koppinen, was published today on Thursday by Jari Siltanpää.
In the book Silanjuää tells about his life and career as well as about evil.
The career of the bridge rose to a total praise for his victory at the Tango King’s Tung market in the Seinäjoki Tango Market in 1995.
In the competition Sillajää sang tangos, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuopopamaki had composed a tango piece for Silla pole at the request of a man, which Kassu Halonen put in a slightly different form.
In fact, it became one of Finland’s most popular songs in the music history of Finland.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: The head of the tail sang it on the tape in a terrible hangover and only after a couple of hours of nights.
We had a party last night.
I was so in a bag.
The head of the bridge remembers in the book.
You wouldn't know that it's been written next door.
Although I wasn't physically at my best, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to insist on being perfect and perfect all the time.
The second one of the most popular songs of a man, which is mentioned in the book, happened nearly twelve decades later.
In 2013 Silt Head resigned from his then partner, and the case finally ended up with You too earned a gold copy of the texts published as single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered at the Saara Crescent were not like the Songhead wanted to.
The head of the bridge had imagined making a record telling the truth about his own life, but the words of the song telling the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper Jari and the ex-loved divorce, Jari was told that she was over-represented and alcohol abused, but Jari said that it was full-blown and that it was not true.
Jari called the book, saying that she was mad at the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up meeting it - and that's right.
In June, the British were holding themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
In the end, 52% of voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, although the polls of the voting week suggest the opposite outcome.
The British economic and economic leaders and economic institutions were close together in favour of staying in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university applied for a divorce, although a few individual researchers may have disagreed with the power of their profession.
The theme of the former US President Bill Clinton's election campaign yesterday, called "It's the economy, step", flew to the ground in the British Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices didn't hear.
They were shocked when, apparently, the economy is not the real thing about politics.
The economic passion language of the country.
Centre for Macroeconomics in the latest monthly survey of professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most common answer is that the economic owners and the polls were not, because this time the voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
An explanation of the loss of the economic position of one-on-one owners is that people do not understand the economy.
Many people still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people working, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British side.
Many also have the impression that a fall in the value of a currency would be a good thing, as it would favour the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economic Commission for Europe, the voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of the economicists was not sufficiently established.
They were particularly praised by the equality of the BBC, which gave just as much space as a couple of per cent of economics in favour of the EU as an overwhelming majority.
The EU's hateful press did not care to share the views of IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE on the consequences of the differences in economic capital letters.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke truthfully of economic growth, trade relations, debt and currency.
And if the messages of the Economists were both heard and understood, they were not conveyed because the Economists represent an elite with which voters do not feel that there is any common interest in voting.
Of course, the academics of big cities such as economics would have remained in the EU, but the message was not effective in small towns and rural areas.
Immigration is also an economy.
The overwhelming profit argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant will take your job, an immigrant will push you into a hospital, an immigrant will take advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Each cafe has foreign workers.
How much more work would the workers have if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, you see immigrants.
How much easier would the British get doctor's appointments if they weren't?
There are also children of immigrants in each school.
How much easier would the children of the right Brittany get to a job if we got rid of them?
In each region, foreigners live in foreign countries.
How much more space would the natives have if they were gone?
This is where they are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to respond and, if successful, their replies did not gain visibility.
Economists failed to explain that immigrants have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security, thanks to the immigrants.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net contributors of the British public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
The Aberdeen real estate reserve was reserved for Brexit in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments were made by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to her, in Aberdeen there was an early booking for Brexit by developing plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote on Plan B, i.e. the EU-responsible camp, began to be reserved for the victory of the camp in favour of the EU, in the event that the result would be on leave.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their funds away from the market.
As a rule, real funds do not normally have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could be necessary now.
We used to pay off cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or in liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily book-circulation fund that the news was about.
According to the elderly, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the Fund was GBP 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company’s funds is approximately GBP 20 billion.
It was the highest number of nine open real estate funds, and Vanhanen says about all the open real estate funds of UK real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
Thus, the reserves were prepared for Brittany in a very different manner.
The funds shut down the trade.
When the European camp won, Europe went awry.
However, the last few two weeks following the vote on the real market were quite calm," Vanhanen says.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Central Bank, in which he estimates that Brexit could be a major risk to commercial real estate operators.
Base funds first, Standard Life, frozen its trade.
These two combined beat the situation and raised the matter to the main ends of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared between 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained close, but private investors were nervous.
Snowball began to spin, and the fund had to shut down after each other.
Aberdeen’s situation was good because of the collected cash, but it also eventually had to freeze for six days.
According to the old man, they didn't really close the deal, they changed the pricing downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out paniclessly.
The message of Aberdeen was that, if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would be a loss.
It calmed the situation, and most of the report was withdrawn.
Since then, it was quite even, and now the market has been very calm for a couple of weeks," says Vanhanen.
He points out that, for example, there has been no similar cohesion between the Manner European Funds of Aberdeen, for example.
A lot of polls came up.
disproportionate attention to the reserve funds.
The elderly felt that the closures of the trade in real estate funds received disproportionate attention.
The open funds covered by the closures manage approximately 4 % of British real estate.
Aberdeen’s closure lasted six days and the company sold less than 10 properties from 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned their investors this week that it might retain its fund for 2017 onwards.
At present there is uncertainty, and economic growth forecasts have gone downwards, but the situation does not look "more direct" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite doubt, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen points out.
The rate of pounds and dollars is lowest in 30 years, and in addition, the market has 15% discount sales compared to the Brixit vote at the earliest.
The dollar player can now buy the same property at a cost of up to 30%.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Vanhanen.
Brexit brought sales to London's real estate market in London.
At 2:00 a.m., the situation did not seem to be much different yet.
However, at 4 a.m. when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, the UK Real Estate Fund, woke up to see the results of the Brexit vote again, the situation was different.
There you go.
I realized this was going to plan B, but Vanhanen says in another home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already fully alive in spite of the morning.
The television screens, which were normally meant to be silent by the office, were familiar with the news, and the people who were usually silent to listen fully when Mr. David Cameron stepped in front of the camera this morning to tell the difference.
When the market opened, the screen terminals blinked all red.
It was a morning that never believed to be alive, says Vanhanen.
It is not true that, despite the riot, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, finished two real estate transactions on the day following the Brexit vote, i.e. on the basis of two real estate trades.
The atmosphere was confusing.
However, the option was well prepared for the future, and therefore the situation was quite calm," Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote started with a change of order.
The vote was followed by a storm.
The pound went out, the British leadership went on a shift.
The market was expected to have fierce bills for the British and especially London real estate markets.
Up to 20% mines were planned for London offices in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze into trading one after another.
Aberdeen did so much for six days.
Now the noise has spread, but there is still uncertainty in the air.
True, it does not appear to be the last summer holidays this week in Helsinki on the face of the Ancient.
In his view, it is far too early to say much about what comes from Brexit.
So much remains to be done: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been identified as a matter of priority.
The information from CBRE on price developments of the CBRE covers about one-third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all London real estate fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, the deficit increased by 6.1 per cent, Old One is reading.
The figures aren't so bad, but they're month changes.
The monthly index began to be published in 1987, and only five months have had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the same high figures occurred between 2007 and 2008 in the period 2007-2008.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was quickly available for the fall of Lehman and the global economic crisis on the US real estate market.
The old man thinks that the comparison is not quite appropriate, as this is a British domestic crisis.
The atmosphere is different, too.
The real market has not now seen a sale like that time, but a willingness to sell in order to improve liquidity, says Vanahanen.
There is also a normal amount of money available.
In any case, the repair movement could have been in the face of any event the repair movement could have been in the face.
As a matter of fact, the price adjustment is no wonder of him - it could have been ahead without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen's estimate, the prices of London and other world-high city buildings have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and the offices are overpriced," says Vanhanen.
So the fall started very high.
London prices have written up for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown strongly, the population of London as well as the population of London.
The second major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalising, says Vanhanen.
New players have become markets in the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for property investments abroad.
London is an easy destination for a well-known city.
In addition, low interest rates have been used to feed prices, which is why pension companies, for example, have had to look for income from new destinations.
The loan for this loan has been readily available - although the bond has been used, according to the old man, now clearly less than during the boom preceding the 2008 crisis.
Split up, spread out.
In London, the rise in prices stabilised last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen, too, began to lighten his own holdings in London, and last year was a net sale.
There was some kind of translation to be expected, and now it's here.
What about from now on?
It depends on how the British economy is developing, says Vanhanen.
He's afraid to judge what's coming, but he's telling me that he's hardly gonna be able to do anything about it.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a downward or even process ahead of us.
The old man has seen several movements up and down since 1988, as he has been in real estate.
And he's still an optimist who thinks we're getting through the holes at work.
If you are well prepared for risks, you will be in a better position.
He believes in global decentralisation.
If you have invested in a single market, there is too much of a victim of it.
If it is decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, says Vanhanen.
The S-group will begin to register for more information about shopping information.
The S-group will know what you are eating, as the commercial group has told you today that it will start to collect more detailed information on the purchases of its customers.
So far, once the data has been collected from the total amount of the receipt, the group will begin to fish for the products purchased at the beginning of May as well.
The S-group is coming after Kesko, because the data on the goods purchased with the extra card have been collected in the Kesko Customer Register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riita's feedback on the programme has been very positive.
Detailed information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing on an authorised basis.
The most effective channel is an email.
In rare cases, the customer has banned the use of product information, Riitala tells Ässanom.
According to him, Kesko is not going to respond to the transformation of the S-Group.
Kesko already categorizes its parent client in ten groups according to simply purchasing operations.
The classification is updated monthly.
The applicant customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount used.
The information is used for targeted marketing for the customer.
The detailed purchase data will only be collected from the K-Group's own chain.
Partners, such as Lester Oil, do not give up their information.
Lidl Finland does not have a host client program and does not have this kind of planning.
Finland's Finland's local retail has its own Yhikösbonus customer program, which can be associated with selection houses, Siwai and Euromarkets.
Currently, we do not collect data at product or group level, we stick to the total amount of the receipt.
So we know which store the purchases were made, the day on which the purchase was made, and the total amount of the receipt from the customer.
We have not gone to the level of K-group or S-group, says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer programme will be reformed in the future, but the Mediterranean trade will discuss this later.
However, the Ora does not promise that the product information will not be registered.
At first, you're going to have a little fun.
The SOK Customer and Customer Register has so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal data and address data, the basic information has included vocational training, education, housing, years of birth of the child and personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The S-Presidency purchase has been entered in the register for the date and time of purchase, place, total amount of purchases and method of payment.
In addition, the S-boning partners’ data have been obtained from their cash register systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at the product level will start to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, data on S-marks, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a long time, customers have had the hope that the marketing could be further targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, the customer and partner manager of SOK.
The S-group informs the customer of its way of informing the customer about the change.
These may prohibit the use of specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the information is recorded in the baskets, in any case, whether or not it is stored.
A willing person can check his or her deposited data on the S-Group website.
For example, cashiers do not have access to the information, stressing Saarikoski.
Video: Heila's kid is the newest dog-reinforcement in Customs's newest dog-to-dog platform is going to be the first explosive dog in the world.
The masculine doctor's cub pours up five similar boxes placed in the same country line at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long before it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs Inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with its favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a jar of shells snoring the field gas.
The liquid gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of Heila-dog.
Security and Online Trade Accesses
Heila is the first dog specialising in the search for weapons and explosives in Customs and will be placed at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Suntio to other border crossing points and ports as necessary.
However, the airport will be Heila’s main job as the international security situation has changed due to serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have led to measures in Customs and, following the attacks, controls have been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, the Inspector General of Customs.
The second access to training for weapons and explosives in Customs duties is the delivery of mail via Helsinki Airport.
Every year, as a result of the increased internet trade over the airport, up to 40 million mail broadcasts, including weapons and explosives, may be available abroad.
In recent years, customs has made some 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition, ammunition and explosives, as well as their departure materials available from online shopping, passenger baggage and air cargo at Helsinki Airport.
Heila will be working all over Helsinki Airport.
It will examine registered baggage and mail items.
In the ports it will be of great benefit in the future when it can go through large containers and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of its performance, Customs will assess whether further weapons and explosives symptoms will be trained in the future.
Grönberg welcomes the idea.
School Monday
Heila-puppy training is co-ordinated by the Customs School of Dogs at the University of Tull on Sundays.
The force also visits police and defence personnel to train with Heila.
The police have strong experience in the training of dogs and in the training of explosives known to the Defence Forces.
Customs, together with other authorities, decides what smells Heila is taught to identify.
They will always be trained as appropriate, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six drug dogs, money and drugs Massi.
Labremister Heila has been selected from the ten puppies of the puppy.
The selection criteria of the dog chosen for the airport include snooping and hunting, as well as calmness, as the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntion, is a close working partner with the inspector, but also a family member.
There's no way without Heila getting at home, Suntio goes to the house.
Mild orders go to Heila from a one-off box.
The camera camera in the evening is missing a fast dog's mike cover, but Heila will immediately restore the cover from a soft toy from the "irti" hand.
Hard competition from work to work.
The initial training of the helke will be completed next year.
There are still levels of tests ahead, next October, where an assessment of whether the training is necessary for the necessary tasks to be carried out is to be carried out.
Heilä can see a job in Helsinki Airport next year, if everything goes as planned.
Passengers cannot, unfortunately, come to iron the dog on top of the work vests, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one dog at work is about EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owner.
The working days may be longer, from 8 to 10 hours, but the active part of the job lasts only from 10 minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Customs.
Heila was the owner of about 20-30 Customs employees.
On the site of Suntion, which has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs and in the field of supervision in Tulli.
The country was given its first Olympics - the nation gets a day off.
The Olympics in Fiji, with less than one million inhabitants, are valued so high in the country that the government has set August 22nd as a national day off.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fijian Government has confirmed that the matter has been resolved by the master's title.
The day off will be held the day following the team’s return home.
The hero team is also authorised by national courts in its country of origin.
Fijian Rugby Team Festival Championship.
The Guardian says that the country was followed by the final capital city of Suur, where a screen had been set up for the stadium.
Normally only the native Fijians are interested in Rugby, but this game united our multi-cultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encouraging, said Maikele Seru Guardian, editor of the Fiji Times.
Dramaa, in the island of Rio Dramaa - the Finnish Finnish translator fainted after the performance of the miracle after the miracleing.
The printing company, Milko Tokola, managed with the last company 175 kg after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature to provide for the take-off.
During or shortly after the pick-up of the loads, he has been fainted many times.
No one's ever known why.
In Tokola, the outcome of the push was 1,75 kg and the blow was 1,5 kg.
The total cost of her co-financing was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get a job last week at least 1,75 kilos, as well as another one.
In the wild business, the weights rose as a result of a fierce screaming.
The body was shaking under weight until the Queen accepted the lift.
The fact that he has suffered from knee problems was a joy for the Finnish publicist.
ROPS got a Estonian-sponsor Prosan - Fleet League - Evening Sanomat.
The Rovaniemi Ball Society, playing in the men's football league, has concluded a permanent agreement with Albert Prosa, the Estonian champion, for a period of time.
We are looking for a lead player with power and a threshold to enter Finland and Rovaniemi for our team.
We went through a lot of 50 players from around the world with 10 player agents.
As a good alternative to Prosa, coach of ROPS, Juha Malinen told us in the bulletin, Prosa began to separate himself from the crowd.
Prosa, 25, arrives at Rops from a farm-based Flora, where he scored a total of 51 goals at 109 matches.
He has also played with the Estonian national team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with ROPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemis face the SJK of the master of Finland.
There was a need for another assailant for Rops when last year's earthly King Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star once again meets: the teenage Shorts reveal almost everything.
The modern Family Comedy of Alex Dunphyna has become familiar with Ariel Winter's comedy comedy comedy again by introducing her mighty body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in ministurs, which do not leave much to imagine.
The Shorts revealed not only the player's legs but also this backside.
Winter, 18-year-old, has recently given much attention to changing his style and behaviour by making much more courageous.
The star has posed very little in images published in social media and has taken a number of tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen in very few costumes.
Winter, which is the threshold for all eternity, has recently also published several pictures of himself at the meeting.
If the image does not show, you can look at it here.
Last summer, Fox News asked the assistant why Winter has changed his image so radically.
Then, the founder and CEO of ThormenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had "typical Hollywood transformation" going on from a child star to a child star.
He has been on TV for almost his whole life and grew up in the time of the Kardashians.
He has learned that the more he shows the surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, the more Palmer says to Fox News and adds that the exact exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series, which was only 11 years old.
The actor has been agitating some of his long-term fans with his immigration.
It is not hard to know where she will be in 10 years, when she is already so tough, says a woman in Winter.
On the other hand, some of the fans of a woman are defending an actor and insisting that criticism be ignored.
You look great.
What others say is exactly what they say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a young woman excels.
People of the Nordic countries prefer to visit Finland - tourists are tempted by a revival: In the autumn, it is possible to see a random miror aurora in the autumn.
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start their refover trips from the beginning of autumn," says Visit Finland in the newsletter.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of the Japanese renewal tourism.
Revoon lights are super cards for our winter trips and are closely connected to the winter and snowy landscapes of the heart.
There is a good demand for the winter winter renewal stores of the magazine, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Rarely knows that the restoration season begins from an early autumn and goes on to spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see a so-called ‘mirr aurora’, where the surface of the lake reflects the revisions of the vision of a double-fold random, says Anne Lind, marketing manager at Visit Finland.
The main focus group of visit Finland’s revival campaign are wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city who dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, through online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by the University of Aalto and the University of Turku and Tokyo researchers, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture among the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see the most obvious unique attractions in Finland, and this fleet has a huge potential, according to Lindi.
Nights spent by tourists in Finland have increased clearly more in other Nordic countries than in Finland.
Last year they spent more than double nights in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting for Finnish tourism as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese used EUR 183 per day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain will be satisfied with Rugbywar as the master class organized by Fidi is headed by gold.
The impressive progress made by the United Kingdom in the Rugby tournament broke into the final challenge presented by Fiji at Thursday night's final when the team experienced 43-7 crushing losses at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji organised a Master's Course in Reading, Drizzles, Traditions, Supporting Game, Running Courses and Instincts when winning gold - their first Olympics - their gold medals.
The loss was accompanied by a reasonable comfort from the silver medal list - the third of the day of Britain - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic Rugby opening tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The hard 7-5 win of the semifinal played on the same day in South Africa could have plagued them in the finals.
However, in spite of this, Fidi would have won as many as 15 top-quality teams in this state as possible.
Great Britain may - but probably not - be relieved that at least one of the Britishs has a gold medal on their necks tomorrow: Fid's head coach is Ben Ryan, former boss of Wimbledon.
The trip to Great Britain has been quite a challenge.
Eight years ago when they trained Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This mood is happening, but development is astounding.
Fidi very much began to reject UK tacos for fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team were like they were running busses moving in the direction, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived in the corner of the target area.
At the time of four minutes, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown in the right side of the right side led to a goal.
12-0, and the United Kingdom had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's great shock stopped the male mountain Leone Nakarawa from making a third paint, but that was only a slow stop for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Bloodloaf scored at the right corner of the goal, and the United Kingdom was 17-0 losing.
Nakarawa scored again on a new start, and the clock was still over a minute... the first half of the day.
Vatemo Ravouvuou then rushed through the British Tacos and rushed to the line to score.
After the Earth's bombing, the situation was 29-0 on the way to the break.
It looked like Fidi was born to play Rugby, while the United Kingdom was just starting to learn the game.
And that is the reality of the matter.
During the break, the United Kingdom made numerous changes that blocked Fidi's pad... for four minutes in total, which was good compared to the first half of the year, until Joshua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pitch game.
Dan Norton caught a goal in the UK at the left corner of touchdown and narrowing the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose supporters were singing, swinging flags and dancing in the sights.
It was hard not to admire Fid's joyful approach.
Mata Vilime last minute was hit by a maze in Fidi's cake, which didn't need to be mashed.
There was a whirlwind, a fidish hug, and the United Kingdom fell on the lawn, completely beaten.
On the same day, Fidi had hit Japan in the semifinals of 20-5, and the United Kingdom won South Africa at a strict semifinal, where each scored one goal - the UK goal was solved.
Brown took over South Africa's leadership in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal area with a dazzling footwork and scored under the paint poles in the second half.
A huge late shock from Marcus Watson, the brother of the UK 15-aside-rugby team of Anthony's brother, ensured victory and finally a silver medal.
The coach's fight against cancer led Helen Glitter and Heather Stanning to a rowing victory.
In these games, there will be no gold that will grow in feelings, and that really does mean something.
From the first bet to the final, 220 hard shots on the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning from gold at the Estacio da Laga.
There were three votes in the boat. Coach Robin Williams’ echo was present all the time when the twins were fighting for the second consecutive Olympics at the women’s competition - the first women in British sports history books, which are all over this achievement.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance undefeated, which is also recordable.
This is what we see, two great athletes attached to the surface with a bow of grace, not a complete picture of the nature of victory.
There is a group of helpful handshakes behind each row of gold that are gradually promoting the things that matter, and none of them was as essential as a coach who, 30 months ago, after receiving a cancer diagnosis, knew whether he would live until now.
As he said, the situation was close.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could've been a while.
It will change your way of ruling.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Wednesday was fortunate that his treatment was able to begin at the beginning of 2014 during the period during which they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression could ever be used in such situations.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better quickly.
It made me want to do it.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around Division 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Warming itself is a long way away, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first couple’s thoughts were William, who had been nervous in the morning, and he had spoken a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, an experienced recipient of the royal cannon from the regiment of Afghanistan's command, said: "I've been feeling emotional this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just stresses how important this is to me, how much I and Helen, and also Robin, we have worked.
The past three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Robin would be nothing, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better trainee or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost their competition for five years.
The partner set a rough rhythm that their competitors were not up to.
Even at the last 500 metres, when the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were all right in a moment.
She cried out "in the psych process, stay in the process."
It is really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we tried not to do anything special.
We did not look for joys today, we were just trying to win a good war and a race, and that's what we did.
A couple of years wait before deciding on their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he is married to TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't mean to say that this would be my last competition.
That would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland is exchanging the Government of Panaman leak-circulated government.
In October, Iceland will hold the early parliamentary elections required by the protestors of Panama database leaks already in spring.
The so-called Panama paper revealed the tax burden of several Irish politicians by means of tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but that was not enough for protesters.
His successor Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson promised to hold a new parliamentary election at the time.
The election day is now closed on October 29th.
Analysts suggest that it is difficult to predict how much last year's passion affects the autumn election.
During the June presidential elections, criticism of the rulings was clearly evident, and a policy was elected as President of Gudni Johannes, a candidate from the outside.
Trump said that he was sarcastic in claiming to be the founder of Obama Isis.
Donald Trump, president of the United States of America's Presidential Committee, has withdrawn his most recent referees.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder of a union organisation, Isis, and Democratic League Hillary Clinton, involved in the establishment of an organisation.
The Democratic Party was upset about the speeches and asked for forgiveness from the Right.
The commander of the army should never be allowed to let anyone who could sink that way, your Clinton sign.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a muslim-like burkini swimsuit on the beaches, for example, the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that it is forbidden to go to the coasts and to go to a swimming area without a good manner and a secularismic swimsuit.
The decision also states that bathing suits, which are highly expressive of religious ties, can increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the subject of a terrorist attack.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove into the population celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two fact-finding organizations, who joined Isis, attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing waters in the Oulu region passed through the selenium - on Lake Pyykösjärv, the blue seam.
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue-collar rescue has been observed on the shores of Lake Pyykösjärvi.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, environmental action in the Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches in the Oulu region and 30 other common bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the coastline of the sea basin, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococcal bacteria in all bathing waters were below the limits laid down by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The water content of sea basin bathing water E.coli and enterococcal concentrations were established on Wednesday, when the concentrations of the bacteria had fallen below the limits of the measures.
The blue seam found on the shore of the lake of Pyhäsjärvi does not yet make water unsustainable, but in favourable circumstances the situation may change even as a bluefish flower, where the water surface is composed of blue-green resting plates.
The measures will follow the situation with more frequent checks.
If there is a change in the blue-league patterns, the information on this issue will also be provided on the bathing record.
Look at the results of bathing water samples from here.
MKK's HARTA's Forest Gift Reduction: More than 80 per cent of forest owners outside of forest owners.
The forest contribution is one tax transition in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance for the next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax levy to be granted on the basis of a gift tax on the conversion of the forest holding.
At the Ministry of Finance's initiative, forest talent reduction has four objectives: to promote the generation changes in forestry, to increase the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest space and to increase the supply of wood.
The purpose of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial agriculture.
The forest owner would make a deduction from the pure income of the forestry industry.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forestry is good, to comment on the forestry producers' association (MTK) Director-General Juha Haharainen.
However, the venturer finds critical tax returns in the proposal.
It is proposed that the reduction in the forest gift should be made to the pure income of the forest owner.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
In the opinion of the MKK and Hakaraiinen, the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the sale of wood.
At the VM's end-of-life survey, the fact that a reduction in the net income of forestry is prevented prevents the loss of forest income, which should be deducted from other taxes, would result in a loss of income from forestry.
A person will gain tax benefit even if he does not wood mine.
The calculation model is too complex.
The average forest owner is unable to visualize it, says Haharainen.
The model also applies, according to him, to only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit for the value of the forest is set at EUR 40 000.
It's been drawn too high by Häärainen.
As such, he said that 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners are excluded from the scope of the exemption.
The model would have an impact on about 10 % of the forest management community, he says.
In VM, it is considered that the border guarantees the purpose of growing the farm size.
The forest-based forest gift reduction has been drawn according to Haharais for decades.
Against this background, the management of forest-ownership and land-use management is based on the management of forest-ownership.
According to the JRC, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and around half of forest owners are retired.
The powerful raspberry surprised the carmakers in Himanga - two cars went back into the ditch and ran into each other.
There was a special pursuit of the Kalajoki Himanga on Friday afternoon.
According to the rescue facility, two vehicles in a row of time went back into the ditch, after which the rear came to the rear after the previous drive.
According to President Harri Pyhäti, the fireman of the Sun's Fireflies, the abandonment of the ditch is suspected to have been caused by a strong coup.
There were two people in the car that were back in time who were both transported to the hospital.
There is no more detailed information on their injuries.
The driver of the driver of the driver of the driver of the driver of the driver's car did not get hurt.
The accident occurred on the highway from 8 Himanga a few kilometers to Kalajoki.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments.
Recent research results from the University of Turku researchers can help to improve the efficiency of cancer treatments.
The findings of the research group of Academic Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the cancer's hardness increases the malignant quality of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as chest tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in this environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the cancer surrounding tissue to the normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by concentrating treatment with cancer cells in addition to the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue.
The results have been published on 4 September in the Nature Communications magazine on Cell Biology, which is rated in the field of cell biology.
In the court, the D.A. demands a murder conviction also for another perpetrator.
The death of Muhtu's family home is due in court for both convictions.
Two young men were sentenced in June to prison for family home deaths in Muhek.
The second received 8 years of 4 months, among other things, from the murder and the gross robbery of a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and brutal robbery committed as a young person.
The convicted person was also convicted of the gross protection of road safety as a young person and of the transport of the vehicle as a young person.
The Prosecution was chosen by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received the severer judgment.
The D.A. demands that a less convicted person be convicted of a murder of a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in complete understanding at the time of making.
According to the district court, the 17-year-olds killed the school’s child care unit supervisor who worked for the man last July.
The 17-year-old, who was the victim of the murder, attacked the manager on the sofa in the back of the living room, according to the reasoning of the judgment.
The director had taken off and put up with a young person in his room, when one of the youngsters hit him with a suction pipe.
The director was also strangled with leadership, hit and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to the mental analysis, both convicted persons were fully understood at the time of the act.
According to the right, young people had planned to escape from the family home at least from the previous day.
Ice is the world's longest long-lasting vertebrate, and it will only grow at the age of 156.
The ice is confirmed in ice, reports a study published in The magazine, in order to become the most remote living vertebrate.
In the north of the north, such as the ice-cream or hosker that wanders around Greenland, the ice-cream or hosker may live to the age of 400.
The female will not grow until 15 years of age.
The fact that it will only grow a centimeter a year makes it more sustainable for me to live more.
Only one species of clams is known to be longer than live iced sharks.
Researchers found out about age by radio-carbonisation.
Due to nuclear tests carried out in the 1950s, there were radioactive residues in some sharks.
Based on these, researchers were able to estimate the age of sharks.
The parent's age was estimated at 392 years - although the throw in the right direction or on the other side may be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic guide - News from the People
Donald Trump's America does not change the world's needs.
Up to a third State would not be able to obtain any income from any tax revenue if the change in the business tax imposed by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, by means of tax incentives that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as a revolution in presenting it on Monday in Detroit.
The company tax fell from 35% to 15%.
It would not be worth picking up a really high sum of 1 000 billion dollars a year.
The excess income tax rate now stands at 39,6, after the reduction proposed by the Finale 33.
The levy was fully waived from the levy.
Trump accused the State of overregulation of the economy and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The aims of the hurdles must be re-established and energy regulation must be re-established.
The security reform of Barack Obama must be brought to a new discussion.
The administration must designate "experts instead of bureaucrats".
According to the "damaging" trade policy, the US is one of the major causes of the US problems.
The Free Trade Agreements would be set aside.
Imports from China would be reduced by 45% for imports and 35% for imports from Mexico for penalties.
We will provide a new future.
Americanism, not the universe, is our creed, Trump declared.
Donald Trump in Europe does not change the world's need:
American cars will be driving on the streets, American aircraft will unite cities, American ships to control the sea, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully examined the talk written by the assistants, even though well-organised protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see the Trump program leading the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program early on Friday in Finland.
A wave of attacks from the past - News of the People
The sea is on its way, but the actual wave of attack strikes in the middle of the bridge of Madrid - the accounting of the past can begin.
It summarised the story of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous guidance tour lovers (2013) was a funny and ronch-side satiric comedy, before the skin where I live, the tops of my career as a Spaniard.
Like Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between those two works.
It is an ideal sedentary love, human relations and family drama with a mother-daughter relationship at the heart of which is the relationship between the mother and the daughter.
The story is simple and is widely seen as a long blockage.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged name person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
A new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) in the latter notes of a random encounter may be wonderful all the way to the end of the movie.
In the form of a return and a long letter, Julieta time life stages for an adult child who grew up.
He begins from the time before the birth of his daughter, the moments when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta, as a young teacher, stands for Adraina Ugarte, from the TV series Ommelten (2013-2014).
Ageing has been dealt with in a way that can be considered as a shrub, but I would say myself that it's a bit strangely and literally by means of a wipe-out.
Almodóvar movies often have a fair distance to being so characterized by blasphemy as always to humor in Julieta.
It is a smoothly played, silent, place with good music in place and quite a dissatisfactioned film, which, as such, has an element in its life.
On the other hand, a typical visual colour vision for the light director is still maintained and so that it begins to give a brief eye-to-eye more pure shape than an effective dramatous effect.
The diseases, deaths or otherwise sharp losses that people are experiencing in the film, but the surface persists in a single cross.
This is particularly the case for a petition: in the case of a name person, housing changes from scene to scene, and the same applies to the remaining ears.
The almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing, i.e. the presentations of each scene, is not much better.
The mechanically repeated impression is external and little breathless.
Almodóvar has written a manuscript based on three novels of Canadian Alice Munro, awarded at Nobel in 2013.
The Novellit has been published in the work of Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a little tacit written literature filming.
Subjects would have been emotionally inextricably inextricably more intense, so much big stuff - especially the subject of the film's subject, particularly the blatant guilt.
Guidance and manuscript: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Majors: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Ruby de Palma, Daniel Grao, Drio Grandinette.
The first night of the film is 12.8 p.m.
The government is trying to re-elect - News of the People's People's News
No new surgeries are being done, pulsing ministers, so that the Finns don't collapse completely.
However, in the spring, head-to-head surgeries will be carried out at the top of the store.
There will be no new surgeries.
The four billion savings already made are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (medium) and Minister of Finance Petter Orpo (coc) under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM's performance because the cuts in social security were decided on already in the spring circling.
Children's, national pensions, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the national pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of compulsory insurance is reduced from 500 to 400 hours.
Training courses are in progress.
How do you expect to be treated?
Why do ministers so easily stress the fact that new cuts are not being made on these?
The year next year is the year.
The relics will be held in April and will be the main heat meter of the season, not the gallulps.
It has also been shown that the outcome of a meeting in different directions of government parties is ruining the government's atmosphere for a long time.
However, the Gallets tell us that the government party expects the basic Finns to be killed, although the outcome of its previous election was a modest 12.3 per cent lower than that of the parliamentary elections.
The Finns received 752 new councillors four years ago, most of which first spring will be realised at the cost of influence by the right government.
The life story of a three-part government of approximately equal size is in the case of the survival of the native Finns.
It has not been the case, but more than half of the voters got out of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's visit have also surfaced.
There will be no new surges in rhetoric, not to be confused by the fact that next year they will be carried out radically and, secondly, they will try to soften the expected blow from the base Finns.
The majors in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be the other way around if the government of Sipilä is still in operation.
The government has set itself the target of undermining debt during this period, but Petteri Orpo's draft budget will take EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After a great government, the government has two options.
The first is to raise your hands already in the middle of the semester and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: indebtedness does not bend or even slow down.
The other one's holding on to the program.
This means more and more severe events over the previous budget line for 2017 and beyond.
The budget would be poetized at least close to balance during 2018 and then, in spring, the parliamentary elections will take place against what will happen.
Such activities did not qualify for credit.
It is absolutely clear that the current measures of debt did not overcome, even though Juha Sipilä was trying to cause a positive feeling.
Secretary-General Martti Hetemäen's presentations to the information conference of the budget prove against it:
The growth forecasts of the global economy have repeatedly proved to be over-optimistic, i.e. there will be no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy temporarily pursued in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent this year and has lasted from 34 to 54 weeks on average.
Unemployment now costs EUR 3 billion per year more than in 2008.
With the immediately presented curves, government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 % in the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the debt recovery made by the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around EUR 6 billion, which will in fact be fully covered by new debts.
This is the idea of what is responsible for the central, assembly and basic Finns.
Question: The municipality wants to leave a lot of work to be done.
Three out of four think that organising children's day care, work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, as demonstrated by the study of the KAKS Foundation for Local Development.
The majority of the people also assume responsibility for a single municipality for libraries, culture, civics, building supervision, university education and waste management.
The responsibility of the region as a whole is more clearly sought for regional planning, specialist care, vocational training, vocational schools and occupational care for the disabled.
None of the tasks under the authority of the municipalities is intended to be transferred to the State.
A underage driver drunk ran after a chase to get away from a cop.
In Joensuu, a 16-year-old motorcyclists drove a police patrol to escape in Joensuu on the Ilomants road at half past half an hour.
Police were trying to stop an air-light motorbike, but a young man went to drive the police to escape from fair speed.
The back drive continued on the Soyajarnanta road, from which it continued to the Sorronahot and the lower forest where the motorcycle ran out of the way.
After that, a young man ran away from running, but a quick-legged cop ran off to the fugitive.
The driver's breath test showed 0.75 percentage points.
He also had no driver's license to drive a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated, among other things, as a serious safety protection measure.
The truck in the rock truck fell into the ditch.
The truck that was on the rock fell in the ditch on Pävijärvi Cavin Road on Thursday night at 21:15 p.m.
The truck had driven to the left in a curved bend out of the road and fell to a large extent in the ditch.
The rescue facility lifted the injured driver out of the broken truck through the door above the vehicle, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first-aids.
The owner left the vehicle to pick up the vehicle.
There was a hydraulic oil spilling out of the fallen truck that was absorbed by the rescue plant into the peat.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An elderly woman disappeared in the afternoon on the air river.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since afternoon in the Lahti village of the air river in southern Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for a woman about six inches tall, tender and handsome, with white hair under the jaw.
Notices and hints of missing movements are requested to call the Ostrobothnia centre’s tip number 0295440513.
Large-scale materials in the air - see the image gallery about the destruction of Parafest.
Para-Festival tents poured out by a flooding current caused by massive destruction.
The president of the Joenuu Para Society, Mr. Arto Pippuri, estimated that the festival would get to its feet economically, and the event could also be organised next year.
The last performer of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on the market at the end of Friday night.
On Saturday, the program will be held at the City Theatre's premises at 13.00 p.m. on the occasion of the presentation.
The Art Centre in Ahjo is a Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The programme will be organised as planned.
The fluctuation flow occurs in a cloudy cloud when rainwater and its weight triggers a falling air flow.
The changes in the state of water in the cloud are binding on heat and therefore the falling air is cooling and its speed towards the earth is speeding up.
The Meteorological Department has been informed that there are several flood flows in Finland during the summer.
The route of late flows is difficult to predict.
The crash current hit the scene of Parafest in the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum in the afternoon afternoon before 5 p.m.
The three tents fell to the ground, the tents had a total of about 200 people.
In the accident, four people were slightly offended by the accident.
There was one child who was transported slightly injured to secondary care.
The air temperatures are ageing in a variety of areas.
According to the study, the skin of the hips is getting older than usual.
Air pollution is the cause of skin aversion.
The British study is described by Evening Standard.
The British parent company Caci analyzed London's air’s most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners in London is two and a half years older than, for example, the elderly living in rural areas.
Small particles that age skin are very bright dusty, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Evening Standard, kill nearly 9 500 lontomas each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to deliver the outer layer of the skin.
In Cacin's study, it was found that early ageing is a risk, especially for those in London who travel on their way to work in the vicinity of congested streets.
London residents may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example in different masks, but it is recommended that regular skin cleaning be a more comprehensive solution.
The driver's brakes failed the man standing in front of you.
The man had moved stones in his yard on a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went ahead, the tractor’s brakes failed and the tractor poured on the man.
The man did not fall under it, but the tractor did, however, push the man to the point where he was transported to the central hospital, seriously injured by the investigation.
The tractor did not have time to go any further, as it ran into the stones ahead.
The flow of new power into the coming period of time will take place.
The Liiga-Riento, who plays at the Ball Championships, leaves in October for a series of better starting points than I remember man.
The team has been together for three weeks now.
The common tune is better than in previous periods, when the beginnings of the series have been dark in Rienno.
Jani Säsä, who continues to serve as the main coach in the field, will praise the new team to be tried and united.
From the foreign three to the middle combatant Fred Musoni begins another season in Riedon.

Through Joban, Kataja and the River Boys, to the U.S. national team.
Anne Jumppanen has been playing in almost all of the Salibandy World Championships since 2003.
Now the sixth race is going on, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better off in North America.
I was working and working with women in Turku when I took note of the announcement.
The U.S. was founded by a Salibandy national team.
I'm interested and here we are, Jumpanen, 48, says.
The champagne was born in 1967 near New York City in the city of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki the year before the year of birth.
In 1987, Jumpanen made it to the University of Joensuu to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, such a species is not yet played at the SM level as a salibandy.
The ball was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja, and later I played hockey in the SM series at the Yokipos, Jumppane's memory.
Jumppen played with the university's Salibandyn MS series for the period 1991-92, the next three years passed in Josba.
At the end of the meeting, he trained the Society's A-daughters at the championship.
The female MS series peaked in silver in 1995.
All in all, Jumppane played through the women's MS series 10 and the balance was set at 169 in a total of 51+34=85.
The last SM period is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were appointed to the national team.
Joban was raised by the Joensuun Salibandy Society in Perttu Puska and the Enolike Tatu Kõnänen were elected to the Finnish national team, who will play in Czech Brno's EFT tournament on 6-8 November.
In Helsinki, a 25-year-old Perttu Puska in Erkä has played this game before the six men's land fights, where he has had a total score of 9+4=13.
Zelkkaen Wiler-Ersigen's 32-year-old defender Tatu Väänänen has recovered from the tourist and is part of the national team's standard equipment with 117 landscaping.
The national team was also appointed to the tournament player Mika Kohonen, who was seen in the Finnish shirt last time in the World Cups last December.
The main coach of the Salibandymaa team is the Kontio Bayer Petri Kttunen.
The Essi Hasun circle of the volley artist closes to Kouvola - the SM-Skulka is missing from the prize cap.
Essi Hasu is about to end up as a beach volley player, at least after at least the current season.
Finland’s national championships will be decided this weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals will be played in adult and young series.
In cooperation, six best pairs of each series of rankings will be awarded for the SM final tournament organised by Kouvola Aeroballers and the Finnish Airlines.
The live color of the tournament is represented by Essi Hasu, who has been a member of Finland’s Beach Volley summits for several years, raised by Elimäe NMKY.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible will be allowed to go to the pyjamas this weekend.
I'm sure the pesis stadium is going to have a great arena.
I haven't often played in the adult series in Kouvola, so it's nice to play in the finals at home, Hasu's feeling.
The Kou Vola region lit up Hasu's spark in sports and gave me a great break for a great hobby.
There are well-remembered memories of a child.
I started a volleyball when I was nine years old in the E-tails of Elimäe's NMKY.
On the top of the mind is too big a toy shirt, the knee protection on the ankles, and the big hypes and choreographs after the point, Hasu remembers.
In a small locality, the sports club was a community in which everyone knew each other.
The collective spirit of the group created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were closely involved - the teammate's father trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the club for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beat volleyy was already a natural selection of species during the junior season to counterbalance the inner balloon.
In the mid-1990s, biking has been played on the shores of Kärämmemi since the 1990s.
The operation of the resort has always been active.
I also visited myself to watch the competitions of the junior MS tour, thinking that one day I would be at the game myself.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu will play the weekend together with Anniina Parkkis in the MS finals.
After Rikka Lehtenen and Taru Lahti, the second-rate twin's goal in the tournament is clear.
A realistic goal is to have a medal.
SM-gold, we're still missing a prize for a prize, hasu throws a mystery at us.
The event of the weekend in Kouvola may be in front of the last familiar audience in Hasule.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work await new challenges.
The final round is after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least at least the toes will be placed on the nail, Hasu will plan.

Tón Koli bravely left to become a farmer of the farm.
Agriculture, as an entrepreneur, means taking risks, sweat and power.
Young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
The work started shortly two years ago with his little brother, Valteri Kol, who worked as a waiter for their home.
Markus Koli, his father’s father, helps and advises his brothers with his own experience.
As a rural enterprise, the start-up took over the debt and increased the volume so that the bread could come into cash from agriculture.
This has been my thing ever since I was a kid.
I've always been on the farm, and now that I've started myself as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in place.
If you start something, I think you need to do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started building a driveway, and at first, the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I myself was very brave to join the project, and I have been fully involved in it, and Solomon Koli tells me and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Kol, who increases trucks, is to invest even bigger in his navets.
The work has brought results, since Solomon's College has been selected among the 10 best in the competition for young food producers in the Rural Future magazine.
At present, he is competing for a possible profit.
He will be able to vote on the website of the newspaper until 21 August.
Bulgaria shall report inflation for the first time in eight months to the Commission for the first time.
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest number of years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after last October, when a positive 0,2 % was reported.
The average annual inflation, measured by the cost of living index, over the last 12 months was -0.8%) (December 2015 - July 2016) compared to the following 12 months (December 2014 - July 2015).
The cost-of-life index of July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2 % compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, there was an increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothes and footwear (2.2%), furniture, food and routine care (0.0%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchatin's "anname" effect is considered to be the Asian "aname" class.
According to Snapchat, an anime has acted as a source of inspiration on the filter, but some observers believe it to be racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables some 150 million new new ones to shape reality and play real ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can change yourself into ananax, a dog or a character that would fit in with painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lises are simple, facial-shape tools that produce more than 30 million improved self-sufficient per day.
All misleading steps quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat lenses have been previously criticised by the accusation that the application advertises blackface or "black face" masks or prefers to bleach the color as a beauty design.
So, when Snapchat advertised this week for some users of the lenses that gave them the eyes, the teeth and the cheeks, some critics called it a racist circle of travelers from Asian people - "grained" or " Yellowface".
And they wonder if these recurring zeros could be a sign of the company's major problem regarding diversity.
News and misfortune spread widely on Wednesday, following reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day later Snapchat said that it had ceased to have properties.
The author offered the explanation: Lensi was meant to be a tribute to anime characters, not to be a cartoon from Asians.
But for the observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the harmful stereotypes of activity.
Others denied anime-comparison with passion.
In his e-mail, Spapani, a Korean-American art student who was widely distributed from photographs, said that the lens was "at least insulting and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to object to a comparison with the side-by-side gross Asian carpentry and filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not only yellowish, but yellowish taken with extreme contempt.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
The global culture seems to be in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, corporate meeting rooms in Hollywood and devices that we all carry in our hands.
The vast, racially more diverse audience of the public of Snapchat can mean that they are more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
The 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a person's image, "it is much easier for these guys to be unnoticed.
Thursday, Zhu, Product Manager and Engineer who works for the Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and invited others to do the same.
In his paper to the Medium and in his phone interview, he said that he believed that racial disputes reflect the lack of diversity of Snapchat's pay practices.
Zhu criticised the company's principally white man and decided to write his paper with hashtag #DeleteSnapchat (#PistaSnapchat)
Either they do not have a diverse representation of different colorings on their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have representatives of different colorings, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or can speak out."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not disclose the diversity of its staff, pointing out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the breeds of his staff, but the representative said that the company hired the recruiter to focus on the derelict populations and to carry forward internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for its part, said that he would keep his Snapchat account closed by adding, "Well, they actually need more of our people to say that this is not a good thing."
According to the Congressional panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Panel of Nations said that the authorities of the United States of America's Armed Forces, in the form of intelligence reports, would present a more optimistic picture of the war on Isis in Iraq and Syria, which was justified by events on the ground.
The Interim Report of the Task Force set up by the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Defence of the House of Representatives, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Human Rights found the "extension of widespread dissatisfaction" among the head of inquiry analysts who said that their presidencies were implosing them on the American efforts to overcome Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the armed forces in the Florida Tampa, which supervises U.S. armed forces operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The results of the inquiry, typically accepted by the leaders of the more valuable Centcom, gave a more positive picture of the United States' counter-terrorist efforts than what happened on the ground; they were normally more positive than the analyses produced by the rest of the intelligence community", the report's press release said.
"Centcom events are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said Ken Calvert, Republican of California, said.
Centcom's commandal failures reach just to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the persistent problems described by the headquarters and analyses of U.S. efforts to train Iraqi troops in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-level administrative authorities of the Obama Administration have determined reports to be tampered with, it describes the knowledge of the analysts as if the Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat posed by the Islamic State, Isisi, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of 2015, many press releases, opinions and certificates of the headquarters were much more positive to the Congress than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom authority publicly stated that the major attack on Mosul's re-uptake could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in Isis's possession.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said Mr. Mike Pompeo, Republic of Kansas, in the opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the senior intelligence officers of the U.S. armed area headquarters manipulated the outputs of the headquarters's intelligence to reduce Isis's threat in Iraq.
The Republics created a task force after hearing that the analysts had raised concerns that intelligence on the Islamic state was being manipulated.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more large-scale results in the course of the investigation.
The Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defence has started an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives published their own findings which were in line with the final conclusions of some of the Republican working groups.
"The Centcom between 2014 and 2015 created a process of inseparable isolation on the intelligence of the security forces in Isis and Iraq," said Adam B. Schiff, the leader of the Committee, in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "prolonged the publication of intelligence records", made the mood of analysts worse and "did not give enough space for different aspects".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to agree their conclusions "on a pre-established or political story".
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday’s preliminary findings of the Congress’s investigation.
Last August The New York Times reports that the Pentagon inspector has started an investigation following the complaints made by Centcom's analysts.
In the opinion, Captain Patrick Evans, a representative of the Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress report as long as the investigation of the inspector is ongoing.
But he said that "experts disagree between themselves on the interpretation of complex information, and the DCI and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security.
There are other consequences than just the question of whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria are successful (as the growing number of defence agencies now claims).
Last year's accusations questioned how much President Obama can count on the headquarters to make honest estimates of the war between Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The review of the Islamic state's inquiry reflects the debate over a decade ago when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote an article in which it was said that despite a number of analysts' objections, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hoker was also a key player in the rebellion regarding the intelligence of the Islamic state.
According to the authorities, last year the Hooker Group concluded that, despite the contrary public statements, the attacks against refineries by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the group's economy because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
The Times reported in September that this finding was not yet reported outside the headquarters.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, began to be criticized last year after many legislators considered him to be a superior assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and replaced him with General Joseph L. Votel.
For the fourth time in a row, the United States is conducting an interim survey with the United Kingdom in a women's country hockey session.
The day after you had made three goals for the team to defeat Japan's 6-1, Katie Bam did on Thursday the first two goals for the U.S. women's ground hockey team, the first two goals for the Americans to win India's 3-0.
Five goals in one game sounds unforgettable, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really a person keeping records of his paintings."
But he knows that the Americans are in a 4-0 Olympic tournament and they share their group first with the United Kingdom, which was still undefeated after winning Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first round.
Both teams have survived in the middle of the quarter, and this game will determine who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams in their group.
The first one will seek a strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, at the start of a slightly longer quarter-finals.
Any random game ends, the Americans have come up with a surprising success here, four years after they stayed at the Olympic Games in London for the last of the last 12 teams.
Bam was on the team.
He grew up in the Pennsylvani Blue Bell and picked up the ground hockey team for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twins played in Drexel) as a member of the national team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all its ages.
He was not at the 2008 Olympics because he failed to join the final player list.
In 2012 nothing went wrong with him and his teammate.
The following year, Craig Parnham was appointed as a coach and things began to change.
"A change in the uniform, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same working pace in London as we do now.
We have made a complete transformation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half of the paint work with a festivities close to the goal.
India had entered the game with no victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and held the third round of 1-0 readings until the end of the third round, when Bam took over the situation.
He carried the ball far from the left side of the field, then turned around in the middle and pushed the ball to the finish, taking the Americans to the 2-0 wire.
Melissa Gonzalez added four times in the middle of the final finish.
This puzzle was the first US goalkeeper to Jackie Briggs, who had scored one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in good shape.
So is Bam.
"We have a good situation now," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
The peace of trampoliin among the most Olympics in the middle of the peace of trampoliin.
Whatever you are, whatever time is, the Olympics are in progress.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be persistent and inevitable, fierce between competition and effort.
It's as if the Olympics itself were a flaming commotion transmitted from a bow to a swimmer and from a gymnast to a triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to the conversation of a fellow guest in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Closes' hatred.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first time of the Olympic Olympics and the future heart-breaking laughter, could well be one of the names known to everyone at the best viewing time, supported by sponsorship agreements and TV commercials of good mind - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a swordman.
Dooley, from the California Lake Forest, 28th, competes at the Olympics in the trampoline.
The Olympe does not illuminate all species as many as one.
The furthest from the center, partly in the shadows, are the species that not all generally accept: aerial seams, bows, balloons, taekwondo.
We've always had a twilight for as long as we can live.
But if I may make a moderate number of my special favorites, I would like to draw attention to trampolin’s sad charm.
Although trampoline has been at an Olympic level since 2000, when it made its first appearance in the Sydney Games, its presence has been so low over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed did not realize that it was an Olympic species at all.
This may be a regional lack of knowledge.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in this area, it has never won a medal in it, and its athlete has not made it to the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians generally share the medals of men, Chinese and Canadian women.
This year, the Dong Dong and the Canadian Rosie McLennan are defending London's gold medals.
However, trampoline is associated with a certain type of subscribing charm, partly because it sounds better for an uncivilized ear than for a clown school.
I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a flying fan.
There is a potential for pleasure in the species, as noted by the colour of the drawings of the endless peaks, but it also has the sweetness of gymnastics and swimming, the two species that combine in it in principle.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means "potential platform".
The Master's goal is to jump on the giant trampolis to a height of almost 30 feet, and they must perform a rolling series of business (translations, skills and volts) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic Programme, they will be assessed on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
32 athletes compete in Rio in 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic direction is straight ahead.
The Medal Wishers must go to gold in search of gold further, faster, faster, higher and higher - sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are not only hunting a target or start-up wall, but also, on television news, another laughtering border: world or Olympics.
This determined goal is noble, admirable and even fanatical - and can even bring the viewer to tears.
But that's also the reason why watching races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline provides a resting moment for this.
The trampolin direction is up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The contestant rises up to a new rise, with the impression of weightless as an astronaut, going up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
Of course, this does not involve competition or difficulties, but there is no intense rush towards the end, no jumps to the distance, only a dream of time and gravity, a melting interruption during the programme.
It's as close to the state as it can be at the Olympics.
Women's competitions and then the finals will be held on a Friday afternoon at the start of the broadcast at 13 (ET), which will also come on Saturday at 13 a.m.
NBC will send the finals as part of the afternoon software from 14 a.m. to 14 a.m. on either day.
In the midst of the Olympic drug, they offer a quiet, charming moment which, most likely, is not noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by providing male athletes with a view to looking and obsessing (such as some time ago, the U.S. male army proposed by the Journal of The World Street), Dooley is just waiting for his horrifying new fandom.
"generation supports its mind" in Ethiopia, which is a long-standing ally of the United States of America.
Violent protests in Ethiopia.
The protestors demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Sighters say that many protesters have been shot to death in the encounters with the police.
Is Ethiopia an outbreak?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a strong West ally, with a rapidly growing economy.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have been shaking the country as it spreads to more and more areas.
One last week, thousands of people were rushing to the streets, demanding profound political change.
According to the human rights groups, the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said that the police shot and killed dozens of non-attached protestors.
The spread videos recorded in the demonstrations, which are believed to be last year's last year or this year's beginning, show how the security authorities are hitting young people with their sticks while they were forced to stand on the wall with their hands.
The United Nations Supreme Court of Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It was always difficult to hold this country together, and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, Project Manager of the Horn of Africa International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia, after Nigeria, is the second largest country in Africa, and the Nordic countries appreciate its stability.
Military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much help from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has grown at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital Addis Ababa is even a new train for business travellers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights organisations have always talked about government oppression, the country's opposition has been limited and the dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed or driven far away from the desert.
This could be a change.
"If you suppress people, and you have no choice but to comment, this will happen," said Seyoum Tesome, university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The group agrees with the work of the group.
One generation disagrees with the opinion of one generation.
The choices are diverse and cover the rule of control of the entire coalition governing land use.
After much of the last year's critical election, the ruling party with its allies received a position in each opposition, and now it holds all the places in Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border with Eritrea are growing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border took hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have more or less been defeated over the last few years, can try to exploit the humidge and re-arm itself.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of influx, bitter feelings are now about to explode.
The image seems to be seemingly harmless: smartphones.
Over the last few years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media when the most expensive smartphones have become common and the internet service has improved.
Even if the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people may still communicate location through hidden network proxy servers.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
In other words, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia, the Oroms and the Amharas, are doing better together.
Orodes and Amhars are not natural allies.
The very long-term ambers, who come from most of the Christian highlands in Ethiopia, were successful in politics and in business, by using organ, many of which are Muslims and who live in the ales.
But this, too, is changing.
"We're on our way to an organisation under one umbrella," said the head of the organ leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The main protests have been in the Amhara and Oro- and Oroma regions.
Many large and Oroms think that Ethiopia is unfairly governed by the Tigre people, covering about 6% of the population and controlling the armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the restlessness is the loss of Meles Zenaq.
Meles, former leader of the rebelry, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around the corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly qualified to detect early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make the opponents safe.
"Cycling does not have a basic instinct like it," says conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemaria Desalegn, was picked up relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the northern Ethiopia tigre region, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say that the security services controlled by tigers do not trust him.
Many people fear that this may lead to increased bleeding.
For the first time, Ethiopia was under such a flood in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds about the elections that, according to the analysts, seemed to be the government’s first fluttering and then beating them.
In the subsequent impact, many protestors died, albeit less than in recent months, and that period of rest passed relatively quickly.
Developmental experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for their views on infrastructure planning, such as a new business train, and important progress in the fight against poverty.
Of course, this has clearly not stopped the domestic self-publishment of the contempt of the Ethiopian Government.
And now it's getting a dangerous, ethnic form.
In the last month, protestors in the Amhara city of Gondari attacked companies owned by tigers, and anti-tigre hatred is becoming increasingly common in social media.
Analysts say that demonstrations put the United States and other Russians in a clumsy position.
Government has used Ethiopia as a base for air transport to a foreign Somalia, although it said recently that it had closed down this base.
Although the countries clearly want to support democracy, they do not want to see a region that is already unstable to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is real balance."
Donald Trump □ Obama-based-Is-Is-his- argument that he would be "friendliness"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign on Friday, claiming that he was not serious when he was this week several times inspired that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic Group of States.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his defenders, who have worked hard to defend him during a period of shock, in a difficult position in which they have to explain comments that he does not necessarily mean.
After the tip on Wednesday night's campaign, Trump was more and more enthusiastic at Thursday's interviews where he was inspired to say that he really meant to say that President and Clinton created Isis.
But Trump said that he was just being sarcastic.
The publication was complete from the previous day when Trump said that he had been seriously accused of several interviews.
When the Conservative radio runner Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trumps ease his remarks by reminding him that Obama is trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate took this to his hearing ears.
The latest storm of criticism will come in a situation where Trump has refocused his campaign among the results of the opinion polls which are taking place in the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought to talk about the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the subject again.
I run back to Twitter, he warned me that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he thought the speech was boring.
Trump is a former use of sarcasm defence.
Later in July, after he faced a large criticism apparently when he suggested that he should hack into Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his comments by saying, "Thank you, I'm sarcastic."
The approach will allow Trump to go at the borders of political speech and then come back if necessary.
"I think it's a model in which he is testing certain messages that are important to his fans, and he's looking at how they work and then 'explice' or 'depending on the reaction'," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's shy about what he said and knows that they're rather vague so that they can be filtered through several different lenses.
Instead of mitigating his speeches for a major vote, Trump has recently become more and more thicker when his popularity has continued to decline.
A new, published on Friday NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey showed that Trump is coming back to Clinton mostly in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
While Trump in general seeks to avoid apologizing for his words about provocative things, he often blames his critics for the misconception of his words or for the misconception of his sense of humor.
As he faces closer and closer examination of the presidential campaign in the last months, Trump's figures have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him, regardless of how provocative his comments are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York, who is one of the most prominent supporters of the Trump, was in great pain in defending the candidate for the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that there are real, political comments in his words," Giuliani said when he was asked about the truth, regarding the real issue of the real argument that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
It is true that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, the small organization he called an amateur was completely wrong, and that is why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
The majority of the Power Republics are trying to claim that the Obama Government, where Clinton worked as a foreign minister, allowed Isis to get worse because it failed to manage the situation effectively in the Middle East.
Before Pennsylvania Friday's meetings Trump continued on to the news attack on the news, which is chasing him with every word of his word and are partial to him.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts who are trying to get out of him, saying, "They're not going to succeed!"
Some Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's excuse as proof that he was unfit for president.
Previously on The Greenpoint: A coffee shop that was closed is going back to Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a rabid, cash-only acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the streetside of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The movement that replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells soap in the form of a cake cake.
The locals went through it as the last loss in a mid-term refurbishment town.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is crushed and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a re-invention.
Entranced Verb opened last November to Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original position.
The new Network has Wi-Fi and can be paid with credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same, and there is the same undefinable atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The new verb is run by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee at the old cafe, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the customer offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, held many things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso as the espresso.
It also used old Verb's light.
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to try it.
He brought in new ingredients.
There are bacon chicken egg cheese sandwiches on the menu, and the packages are available, for example, capers and brown onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The coffee no longer serves beer, but fresh juices are made there.
In nine months, Rodriguez says that he notices a steady flow of old stock customers.
"Williamsburg also became too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One of the last days Rebecca Oliveira was one of the customers.
Oliveira, 34, formerly living in Williamsburg and visiting Verb regularly.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he walked into a coffee shop.
He says that after Verb closes down, he gave up his coffee drink for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
He has now returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a chai drink mixed instead of his evening ice coffee, which is one of the new additions.
Tom Rosen, a new long-term customer, visited Verb faithfully from 2003 onwards.
He went to work first and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen more than seven, regular as a clock, I went in and they were preparing a spiced bagel with butter," he said.
Photograph. Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Roundthal is still making the usual order, but sometimes because of his variation, he has to make room for a tasty bagel with bacon, egg and egg.
Rodriguez says that he does not carry the resentment of a soap shop that took over old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Keri offered to manufacture a special ticket for Verb to use as an ingredient the cold coffee from the cafe.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafe.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he planned to put it up to something soon to make his new neighbours feel welcome.
A new location has other advantages.
The local juice shop wants to bottle and sell frozen coffee.
It is possible that the cafe will expand to the next building.
For many customers, it is enough for them to get their old favorites in the new verb.
Mr Whitt was a regular customer and said that he was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he was coming home walking inside and ordering coffee.
"I've missed getting to smell it," he said.
Aoz Meal: a laxative food for the depression of the depression.
In March 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delno Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office for lunch.
The sensitive direction President Roosevelt liked the fine-looking Fifth Avenue dishes, such as the goose-paying apricot, and Maryland's heifer soup.
In that day, his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato sauce and dessert from plum pie for dessert.
"It was a sign of colinar solidarity for people suffering," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are home historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told us about Chinese food in America, and Zigelman told me about the Lower East Side flooring by food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their newest partnership, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet the supplier at dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unrequited lunch bar in the Flatiron region, which has been in operation since the 19th market collapse in 1929.
Zigelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose of turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the supplier ordered meatloaf, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the depression.
"The lawns were very popular," Zigelman said.
There was no peanuts, there was no liver, there was no beans.
They were made of the material and some cheap ingredient that continued the actual material.
Imagine your cancer so much peanuts that they would form your dinner.
Come on, come on, come on.
"It's certainly felt like lead in the stomach," he said.
In the years before the recession, on the tables of the Americans, especially in the countryside, it was like a eating-in-a-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l
Women's groups made good for male farm workers, and fresh pies were served at breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The book A Square Meal adopted the ways that the nation survived that it was suddenly no longer a country of abundance.
"The food became a central subject for the Americans," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same was a new, affordable diet: Mysterious foods, such as cigarettes and boxes, became the main food, and the box was "a great way to use the food stars", Ziegelma mentioned, because the chefs were able to hide less attractive ingredients under the creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been in the middle of American meals for years, became a carefully administered luxury product.
The special sizes were tested at a level higher than the taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen than the level of calories and nutrients.
In carrying out the study, also for a non-receptible book, Ziegelman prepared an era of food in which roasted onions were filled with groundnuts.
"It wasn't popular for another dinner table," Coe said.
Zigelman specified: "It's not real."
The peanuts are in no way suitable for roasted onions.
This was a feature for many household receptors.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the Director of the Federal Home Office in 1923-1943, controlled the country's way of eating more than ever before or after.
They encouraged women to become "budgetaries" and to respond to the challenge of conversion into delicious doses of flute-like spaghetti and carrot-like dung in newspapers and magazines.
Aā Meal is a festival of historical tasteful pieces.
Specially tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's, let me eat your cake position.
At a time when he publicly praised his childhood's simple, iowa-like country food, he eats like a fine millionaire, which he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
She ate a almost cute dining room with a tuxedo on top of her tuxedo.
She was great out of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not encouraged him to be an example in his own country.
As the book says, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place "not only for the most beautiful but also for the worst-made food in Washington."
Many of the laxative farming practices were rejected as soon as the land got back on its feet.
Our legacy is our continuous concentration in calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they had a better understanding of the way Zigelman's mother was doing her meals, for example, how she could not throw food away.
"He was really afraid to waste food," Coe said.
Zigelman remembered: "He even sickened people."
An accident occurred.
After the plates were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the post-sommeal food that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called a bonfire," Zigelman said, adding that the common trick was to give the humble receptors a visible name.
There was no cream foam in dessert, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone infiltrated their spoons into a sticky, brown filament.
Suddenly, it wasn't bad.
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on,
Sounding like a positive budgetary officer, he told his wife: "A little bit of chopped German nuts could help.
Gilaad will be replaced by the costs of fees in the fight against Mercki in the fight against hepatitis C patents.
The United States Supreme Court has determined that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to receive the financial costs it has incurred in the dispute against Merck & Co Inc, a medicine manufacturer for the hepatitis C patient.
In June, Gilead was released from 200 million dollars after they committed two Merck patents related to Gilead’s success medications in Sovald and Harvon, which was followed by the United States judge finding Merckin’s errors involving false oaths and other immoral practices.
In the judgment handed down on Thursday, U.S. Witness Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to be released from the compensation it suffered against the action.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which manages the market in a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can clearly improve more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other about the ownership of the professional work at the base of sofosbuvir, the active substance of the Gilead medicine.
United States-supported forces say that they have taken full control of the Isis-manbij Manbij.
The United States-supported forces have taken over the northern city of Manbij, near the Turkish border, since the last remaining Isis fighters left the country, the Group representative said on Friday.
Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now investigating the city after the last group of combatants hiding in the city left the city.
Each had released more than 2,000 Taliban hostages, who were considered prisoners by fighters, of the Sharfan Darwish SDF allies, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"My old man is now completely under our control, but we have begun to examine it," he told Reuters.
Clintons earned $10.75 million in 2015, cost 34.2% of federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return showing that the income of the ND presidential candidate and his/her spouse in that year was $10.75 million and that their total federal tax rate was 34.2 %.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charities, mainly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton's way of making nearly 5.3 million dollars for the spokesman's compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster from his book, where he reported his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The vice-presidential candidate of Clinton, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published a 10-year tax return on Anne Holton with her wife, Anne Holton.
Their true federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillry Clinton and Tim Kaine are putting a strain on economic transparency," said the Clinton campaign assistant  Jennifer Palmieri in the opinion.
As a fierce contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
As a rule, candidates for presidential elections in the United States publish their tax returns, even if the law does not oblige them to do so.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have relied on the audit of the tax administration as a reason for refusing to disclose tax returns.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, said in a Communication when he published the link to the tax declarations of the Democratic People's Party.
On Thursday, the Special Assistant to the Trump, Michael Cohen, told the CNN that he would not allow the Trump to publish them until the audit is complete.
Reformed critics, including Mitt Romney, President-in-Office of the Republic of 2012, and other Members of the Republic, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations for charity, his facts and numerous other ties, for example, to Russia.
Clinton has taken on the problem of publishing a Friday online video, bringing out visible Republicans who call on Trums to publish their taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his economic discussion in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for president in recent decades has done: published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has announced that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the 1990s in two years, and the New York Times business column quoted this Friday a number of tax lawyers and accountants who said that the situation may still be the same.
The federal tax rate has become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported, according to billionaire investor Warren Buffett, a code that would ensure that over a million dollars a year earn at least 30% of the taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton Conference in Nebraska, Omaha last week at Buffett, which the Berkshire Hathaway Congress is located there, challenged the Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he too is in the process of controlling the tax administration, and that Trump is not "fear" the tax collection agency, but voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns up to 2007.
Today, the full federal tax rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua, New York, was around 32 % between 2007 and 2014, and their actual combined tax rate was around 4 %.
The Clinton Tax return 2015 showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their main target was a low-cost, index-linked investment fund, and Clinton reported a dividend and interest income of EUR 100,000.

Chili-pimentoms and shrubs enhance the elephant protection of Tanzanian elephants.
Natureists in Tanzania are using an unusual way to prevent elephants from wandering to the local areas of people - they throw animals with chilli powder filled condoms.
The job has proved to be effective, and the idea has been developed several years ago by the Honeyguide Foundation together with the US Nature Conservancy, which has enhanced its promotion by training volunteers in the villages of northern Denmark to use unrestrained four-step ways of protecting homes and crops without injury to animals.
In the past, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world’s elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we have seen a change of attitude in these communities, which is now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them," said the Executive Director of Honeyguide, Damian Bell, in the opinion.
The first two steps shall include the display of an elephant in the pocket lamp and the laying of a horn.
If it doesn't stop an animal, they'll throw it into the "chili cloud".
The container is filled in with silicon powder and ground powder and with a small amount of powder, and then the condom is rounded to such a way that only the fuse is visible.
When the condom is lit, it will burst into the oven and crush the chili powder into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send an elephant in the other direction.
The last way to do this is to launch a trigger that fires a Roman candle in the air.
RT News: A Jewish filmmaker criticises a Berlin hotel that removed Israel's destination number at the request of the Arabs.
A French, Jewish-like filmmaker released a media storm after revealing that the Kikinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list the Israel number. According to the worker, this is due to the Asians' "requests".
The author of the Shoh documentary on the condition that the Claude Lanzmann jar was devoted to the Berlinian Hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German FAZ publication.
During his recent nights, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country code list provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How can it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote.
On the other hand, Kikinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone centre.
An explanation was asked by the filmmaker at the reception of the hotel.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received from it was "a shocking him.
The recipient of the hotel said that it was "the thought-out decision of the management of the two hotels".
The reason behind this decision led to even more shock in the filmmaker.
"The vast majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's directional number," says the employee, according to Lanzarote.
German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman from Israel calls the case "the great misdemeanor", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reporting.
"We were terrified and shocked by the incident.
It's already a big mistake in itself.
But the fact is that this happened in Germany and this is the chain in question.
This doesn't need to be explained.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident caused a fairly counter-reaction online when people called it a scandal.
They sometimes claim that the Kampinski Hotel simply "give up" the alleged demands of the Acquises.
"Woe," said the second publication, which noted that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendam street is located near the synagogue.
The author himself contested all the accusations quickly and called upon the "inaccuracies" and "apologized" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel's report.
"It is a strict command not to include Israel in the quick-choice list," says the representative of the two of us, said Suddeutche Zeitung, according to the words of the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the destination has now been added.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who showed their minds against Brazilian students in Brazil.
On Thursday, the students gathered together with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, when the students met to protest against the reform of the government's public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protestors.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to break up a student crowd, which resulted in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration of horror from plans.
According to the proposals of Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin of Sao Paolo, less than 100 schools will be closed and 300 000 students will be reinvested to save money.
Some protestors were seen writing against temporary President Michel Temer on the walls.
This latest demonstration only took place after the protestors took off as a group to support President Dilma Roussef in voting for his office as a result of the vote on the country's cause.
RT R & D: Trade between Russia and Iran will increase by 71 %.
Following the removal of sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 7 per cent from the previous year, reports the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Djhagarya.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were removed, the Russian companies have shown a great deal of interest in their transactions in the country, the Ambassador said.
Russian companies are continuing their existing links, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is the expansion of trade," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran was 7 per cent higher than the total value of USD 856 million in the same period of 2015 in the same period.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran rose by 91.5 and a total of 697 million dollars.
The 16% of the Russian imports from Iran rose to $158 million.
"The growth of the industry was achieved by the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
In addition, Djhagaryan is expecting a record this year of Iranian tourists to visit Russia.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Mission Centre in Iran issued about 35,000 visas mainly for travel by Iranian citizens.
Iran was also among the 20 countries most visited by tourists in Russia for the first time.
"It seems safe to say that last year's record of Iranian officials in Russia will break down," he said.
At the same time, quite a few Russians visit Iran, which Ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazdi, which retains the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner hit the finish line when the biking gold was caught.
Scotland’s Callum Skinner was honoured by the men in the team print at the Rio Cycling Stadium last night, when the British Team Trio defended his championship from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in the role of his dog colleague Sir Chris Roy, who was well-revinced, and he was a young man when he went to the finish line, and he won the victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick when they set it on a modest footing at the March 6th World Cup in London, even though Hoy has since won his profits.
The problem between Beijing and London’s competitions was the replacement of the Special Envoy Raja Staff.
This was done just in time for Hines to show up.
The end of Hoy also created a vacuum that Kian Emad and Matt Crampton tried to fill in.
Skinner was the man that British coaches held against in the Scots the potential that has now been realized.
Hines, Kenny - who won the championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner made an Olympic record in times of time, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the three of them won a duel of gold.
Hines was almost behind him after his own tour, but Kenny's gun was running the team, and Skinner was holding on to it.
The transformation was a major part of the transformation and included Hines driving on a larger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed his position as an expert at BBC and drew attention to Skinner, Kenny and Hines when they came to the prize level.
A 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said: "Competition is flattered."
I'm just here to do my best and make a good living.
In the finals, we made an Olympic record and won the world's masters.
It was absolutely incredible.
There can be no better way to go.
After winning London in 2012 next to Kenny and Hoy, Hines admitted that he had accidentally fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later withdrew his comments, and the British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no equivalent problem with overwhelming victory.
He said, "I felt like you were in London when there were so many British flags on the stand."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We've lost so many world beads, so once again winning the Olympics is simply great.
One event, one grand prize for the people who won seven out of ten types of cycling in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be waiting for the successful five days at the cycling stadium.
On the basis of the fair evidence by Kenny, it is not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat, the victory of three Olympic gold medals at some Olympics.
That means that Kenny - which is exactly 12 years older than Hoy, also born on 23 March (this apparently sacred day in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - the total number of medals rose to six gold and one silver.
It would be like Hoyl's.
Kenny next competes in a spritzer that starts today and lasts for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I was just enjoying this one now.
Team competitions are always the best.
It will be won together with friends.
It is, in fact, lonely to win one."
He said, "If he beats another two grand medals, he should be given the knight's value."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in times of time in the four-person, four-mile team run.
Their time was 3:51:5.
The world record that won gold in London in 2012 is 3:51:69.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of the competition, when Wiggins will certainly be at the centre of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges last night before driving time, when officials invited him to a protraction.
The competition between women, which ends and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Milgavi Katie Archibald, as the time of the world's record comes at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty team of bikes takes over the middle of the Olympics and achieves a whole set of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete management in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio Games.
There has been a story in the background that the least of them have not been the divorce between the technical director Shane Sutton in April because of the sex and temptation charges, and the end of the career of large individuals, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, on the basis of the first evening’s competitions at the Cycling Stadium, it seems that the British now has the historical reputation to rise to its peak at the very moment could once again be true.
The future future future future future of the  exactly future of the  exactly because of the cut down of the electricity contract, the future future of the fuse of the  exactly because of the cut down of the electricity contract.
The future of the subsoil of Portland Victoria, as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers, is uncertain when the electricity-distributing electricity company revealed that one of the factory owners is concluding a distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution operations will be cut.
The measure follows the decision made earlier this year by the Victorian administration that the aid required for the operation of the plant will not be extended.
Aid for the 20-year period will expire in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be put at risk at the Alcoan Portland plant.
Up to 2,000 jobs may be in danger, directly or indirectly, by shutting down the factory.
In addition, the snowball effect may be possible, as the melting is used by around 10 % of the total electricity generation in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the melting of Point Henry, which led last year to the closure of the Anglesea power plant.
The meltdown of Alcoan Portland is losing money and is under closure.
The measure now follows several years of speculation from the future of the factory, which resulted from a strong Australian dollar and has recently been due to the price of production at the factory.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium alloy from the Loy Yang An power plant in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to have decided their contracts.
Most of the factory owns the Alcoa and Alumina CITIC, and the Chinese CITIC, as well as the Japanese Marubeni Corp, which owns the largest shares.
"AGL expects the operation of the Portland factory to continue, which means that the physical need for electricity for melting will come to an end," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are the so-called "export agreements" which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The agreements have a maturity of 12 months and are therefore due to expire in 2017.
"That's why AGL expects contracts to produce results in 2017", said the electricity company.
All possible results for AGL from 2018 to 2018 are currently limited by strong prospects of the future electricity wholesale market.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of contracts by $187 million in its accounts.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements " does not affect Alcoan ... the ability to keep the melting operation or to secure the supply of electricity to melt".
The US company said that it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, and that the agreement was to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the agreement.
Analysts have been on guard both with regard to the melting of Portland in Victoria, and also with regard to the possible closure of the Tomago factory near Newcastle, because the economic situation in the sector is poor.
Last week, Executive Director of AGL, Stephen Mikkelen, said to the researchers that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity and about 900 megawatts each year.
"If the factories leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [trade] markets.
As an electricity producer, this wouldn't be a good thing for us," he said.
Kendall, not just the real-tv star of the Kardashians, is on the deck of the Vogue of September.
The fourth daughter of Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother-machine Kris Kardashian-Jürr’s clan, is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue’s desired September issue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and modelled on the fashion calendars of Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on Thursday’s account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of dear people made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The public record was followed by a unique (or perhaps only like the Kardashians?), written on the video, where the entire klan of Kardashian-Jnner (excluding the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, and which involved all favorite entertainment, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot his sister's cover, but which ended with a classic translation: they designed a surprise party.
It is a cliché pattern of almost every TV series of children (Seacrest says the lines "you didn't think we'd forget about you" with the credibility of the hand-painted paws), but Kris had to make his other girls profit somehow from this publicity.
This is because we have been able to move on to a new era of the Kardashian era following the Vogue site of September.
Kendall's great sister Kim may have reached Vogue first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is just in its own category.
The Vogue September number is the most profitable edition of the whole year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee note than a fashion magazine, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that last year's 832-page op 615 had advertising content).
Its cover is so eagerly expected that over the last two years, the photographs of the magazine have leaked before the official release.
Previous women on the deck have been, among others, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangel and Kate Moss.
Indeed, in recent years there have been more "publishers who act as models" than "forms that are famous".
The winner and the Ambassador of Dior, Mr. Lawrence, were on the cover in 2013, after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, described by the magazine as a "prominent for success" of his generation, would hit the first category, he would be in quite good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or real stars or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career since Lemonade's publication.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
In his true-to-tv history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be havoc.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and his colleague, Gigi Hadid, calling them "to this day a bucket."
This feeling was once again surfaced with the Vogue cover of Jenner.
But in dissatisfaction, running is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue's September issue.
He's the best in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Bäder's makeup object.
He and all of his sisters will sell you pictures in their own personal, default-backed applications.
He's selling a picture of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who he took to the L.I.E.
And on his free time, possibly just to see Kourtney and her children, he's a true-tv star.
Every year, the legal centres of the Community turn away 160 000 people.
Over 160 000 of the most vulnerable peoples will be turned out of the Community legal centres each year when the sector is preparing for the impact of additional financial cuts on its already extremism activities.
In Queensland, three of the five people - mainly the elderly, the immigrants, the vulnerable workers, the victims of violence, those who are not able to fight unfair evictions and those responsible - are already being turned away in their search for legal advice and representation.
Legal services already restricted to the limits of the Community are preparing for further surgery.
In June of next year, these legal centres are expected to lose 30% of their federal financing.
James Farrell, Director of the Court Centres in Queensland, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres, thousands of people are already being turned away annually, according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not withdrawn, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland Community legal centres are permanently underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they provide each year," he said.
People who leave violent relationships with uncontrollable and crippling debts, families in residence, unfairly separated workers - all people have real problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30% in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queensland residents are forced to navigate in the middle of complex legal problems without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandi of Queensland, so that they immediately withdraw these financing operations so that people can get the help they need in their problems.
Last year, the Government of the State implemented a commitment to increase the national average level of funding for legal aid.
It is now time to look at the needs of the Community Centre for Legal Affairs and their local communities, and the Government of Palaszczu should invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was brought to justice after the employee was claimed to be at gunpoint.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged for the fact that they claimed they did nothing after they were told that the manager of the North Carolina campaign threatened to use the weapon in February when they were driving the Jeep.
The incident was described in a complaint brought by former state campaign software consultant Vincent Bordin, on Wednesday, at the court of the state court in London.
Bordini said that for months he waited for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that "it would not happen."
Chief of Staff Phillip "he pulled out the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap", Bordini said in the cover.
After choosing a local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least three other people had the same experience with Phillip, said in the complaint.
"There is no need to start things to cause harm," Bordini said in the case.
The challenge will only come two days after the presidential candidate of the Republican Republican Party was angry to inform the public in North Carolina that "the people of the second addition" - which is generally understood by the owners and armed forces - could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton was elected and should be elected judges.
The best campaign said that the media had taken his word away from the context and that he was not in favour of violence.
In the bordin challenge, the campaign will seek compensation for careful monitoring and for violence, assault and emotional shock in Phillip.
Mr Hope Hicks did not respond immediately to the request for a comment.
Businesses have failed to reach Phillip.
WCCB, local news firm in Charlote, reports that Phillip has recently left the campaign.
No response was received immediately to the call from his consultant to the Innovative Consulting Services.
The campaign of Donald Trump, president of the Republican Presidential Committee, has been controversial.
The case of the case is Bordini v Donald J. Trump for Of Inc., 16-CS-14Ø, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to channel the lives of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow.
Power will bring recovery and flowering throughout the stomach, not only to local communities and across London.
For myself, this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was also the charm of London's 2012 competitions, when we saw a terrible effort to ensure that all our people and our territories could benefit from the competitions.
The Olympics have brought enormous benefits for the Stratfords and the East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only local communities will be able to create 10 000 new trainees and 40 000 new jobs, and unemployment around the airport will be removed.
As before London's 2012 competitions, some will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the games and that we would be ashamed of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
The obstacles are always to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question it is asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and a growth rate of GBP 211 billion, as well as to abandon the creation of skills and employment, both around the airport and around the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that has carried out an 11 billion-pound infrastructure investment programme in time and in the budget, remaining on: of T5 voted for the world's best airport terminal in five years in a row, T2, built between the two fastest runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to complete the third runway, which will be supported by 16 billion p.m. of private money.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for the United Kingdom, and I am convinced that the Heathrow expansion is also a success for the UK.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure the future of our trade and create a heritage of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the President of the Heathrow Board and the former commercial secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook in cat and mouse games to prevent advertising.
For companies receiving money from online advertising, attempts to bypass the advertising program are "a cat and a mouse play", one of the companies preparing such a program said.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook stated that it would prevent advertising inhibitors from accessing their websites on the computer, Adblock Plus published a blog that said users could update the program filters to block re-promotions on social network websites.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that the code of its website will be exchanged around ads in order to make it more difficult for ad inhibitors to detect which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says that it has turned a new code.
In a copy of Adblock's representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of a back-up fight between the community that inhibits the advertising of open source code and its translators has been ongoing since the prevention of advertising was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the battle is a strong indication of the great grief that advertising inhibitors have become to industry.
Worldwide, around 200 million people are using ad inhibitors, reported last year in Pagefair and Adobe research, which is almost four times the amount that used these programmes in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile phones, and mobile advertising now covers 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
However, the company is after the adists of the websites used on the computer, as mobile ad inhibitors do not work on Facebook mobile apps for the social network or ads, said the representative.
Computer advertisements still generate enough income to make Facebook consider this kind of action to be worth investing in.
On Tuesday, too, Facebook said that it would update its "promotion ads" tool in order to give people more power over how ads are targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters were very serious as they would also block part of the site’s non-advertising content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to tackle the problem," said the Facebook Representative in a letter.
Advertising inhibitors are boring tools, which is why we are focused instead on building tools such as Ad Preferences that provide control for people.
The woman was hit by a car on a Swiss motorcycle, apparently because of suicide.
The victim lay on the freeway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after the woman was left on the freeway under several vehicles on Thursday's early hours in the event of an obvious accident.
The incident took place on the A1 road near the Morges in the Vaudi canteen just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did "unsuspecting act" and settled in the dark to lie down on the road where she hit several vehicles, the Vudin Police said in the statement.
The victim, who obviously tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
He was killed at the scene of the accident.
Several events involving drivers have already been questioned, but not all have yet been identified, told the police who appealed to them and all witnesses who have witnessed the incident to report to them.
The criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logic" step in this kind of situation, Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genevel.
"However, please see if any of the involved drivers will be charged with the charge.
Is it possible to avoid a collision?
It's up to the D.A.', Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years indicate that drivers are not held accountable.
In either case - both of which had a person walking on a dark motorcycle - it was estimated that drivers could not expect to meet a pedestrian on a motor vehicle in the middle of the night, the newspaper was told.
The police were arrested last year in connection with the misdemeanor of death after he was attacked and killed by a man who was lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had passed out on the road, the court was informed.
The Ombudsman noted that the police, who was responding to the emergency, were doing the right thing, and that the presence of a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone who has information on Thursday's case near the Morges should call the police at 0 21 6.4.2016 or 0 21 644 44 44.
NASA Climate: Venus was once a resident.
According to the estimates of the new climate, Venus was most likely to live once again.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed the model to study Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by the research community.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have had hot, water-free surface and carbon fill in the air frame at times to be in a similar situation to the ground.
In the past, scientists have found that the slow rotational speed of Venus explains its thick atmosphere.
However, the most recent simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere, and it could still have been wrong.
The model also looked at the early surface formation of Venus.
The planet was likely to have drier areas than Earth, but there was once enough water and geographical variation to allow life and to protect quickly from water loss.
The advantage of early Venus was also 30 per cent lower sun.
"In the simulation of the GSS model, the slow rotation of Venus exposes it to the day-to-day sun for nearly two months at a time," GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio explained in the newsletter.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of cloud, which acts like an umbrella protecting the surface to a large extent from heat.
In fact, the result is that the average global temperature is less cooler than the current Earth temperature.
The model produced a story of Venus’ developmental stages, which is similar to what the planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to have to live once in a while, it was exposed to excessive heat and UV light over a period of several billions of years.
Its oceans faded and its water vapours burned in a UV light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remains is a thick carbon-atmospheric with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus, which we now know.
Researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate change in Gephysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy gives up on the plague of the Avalanche coach.
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from the work of the Colorado Avalanche coach and the ice hockey vice-president, in particular, as a reason for the lack of influence in the team’s decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, Vice-Chairman/Director General of Colorado confirmed the information and noted that the team will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have done my duty as Vice-President and Chief Coach of Colorado Avalanche hockey with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said Roy, 50-year-old in the opinion.
During the summer, I will think long and hard about how I could improve this team in order to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the position of the coach and the Vice-President of the hockey industry should be in full line with that of the organisation.
He must also have the opportunity to influence decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision," Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization, and we wish him happiness in the future.
Roy was appointed as the winner of the Jack Adams Award for the best coach in the league in the first season of Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the central division to win, but Minnesota fell in the first round of Colorado’s gambling games, and the team did not reach the finish in the last two years.
Avalanche’s games in the season 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 defeats and 4 odds, and the team lost five points to Wild, losing the wild card of the Western Conference’s game.
The goalkeeper Roy, chosen for the Hall of the Fae, won four Stanley Cups - two in both the standing Canadiens and the Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea continue negotiations and delay the strike.
Work struggles by oil workers in the North Sea for wages are postponed when all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, the leading negotiators said.
The lakes against Wood Company, the oil field service company, have been held randomly in the North Sea drilling malls run by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unit and RMT Unions, can confirm that we have agreed to resume the process of resolving the current dispute", read the joint opinion.
Over the next few weeks, we will have a number of full-day meetings early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at problems.
According to trade unions, their recent work struggle, which they claim to be the first over 25 years, was a protest against possibilities, up to 30% wage cuts.
This year, Wood Company cut the fees of North Sea contractors by around 9% on account of the negative market pressure.
The company’s remuneration follows a 10 % reduction by its contractors in 2014 in respect of contracts in their countries.
The company said that further cuts would provide the company with the necessary space to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell in turn has reduced thousands of people's wage lists and announced its plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries, when the company reduces its operations as a result of its giant merger with the British energy company BG Group.
The companies are under pressure because of lower oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK's June decision to leave the European Union.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member of Parliament, met with the co-chairs earlier this week to discuss one of the generation's major North Sea labour disputes.
He said that the North Sea was essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, not just a few, both in the North Sea and in the whole country," he said in the statement.
In 2016, the North Sea is expected to invest less than USD 1.4 billion in new projects, while the average over the previous five years has been around USD 7 billion.
The Kepler is causing the star's speed of rotation in the Star of Plejads.
The most recent mission of Kepler's Board of Governors has helped astronomy gather the most complete list of the speeds of the stars of the Plejad's star population.
The new data will help astronomys to understand why the constellation stars rotate at variable speeds and how the cycles are related to planetary formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will now learn more about the relationship between mass, its age and the history of its universe", researcher Luisa Rebull of the Pasadena Center for Infra-Training and Analysis at Caltech, said in the press release.
The starry of Plejads is 445 light-years away from Earth.
A number of stars have emerged about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching the dawn.
They are now running at the top of the game.
At its peak rotational speed, these adult stars are running large amounts of stars from the star.
When these winds pass through the star's magnetic fields, they brake the star.
When the star ages, its speed of rotation starts to slow down.
The kepler monitors the speed of rotation of each star by observing the appearance of identifiable beams, such as solar rays.
The most recent list of major speeds suggests that larger stars are moving slower than the less massive stars.
The Rebull compares the star to the galleys, the bigger make the devils slower than the smaller ones.
"In the "balet" of the Plejas, we see that the slow wheels are usually more massive, whereas the fastest wheels are usually very light stars", Rebull said.
Since the Starship of Plejads is so close, it is the ideal cosmic laboratory for assessing the characteristics of the stars at rotational speeds.
"The star of the Plejads offers anchors for the rotation of stars in theoretical models that include the directions, the younger and the older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why and why the stars slow down their speed and so-called hanging on their "dance" pin.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejad's speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
